A11IKWE7B29TOJ--A11IKWE7B29TOJ	B01G8YZLK0--0739359355	My super picky dog LOVED these when we first got them, but has slowly decided she's not super interested. I'm not quite certain why, but I can't hold it too much against them because she normally turns her head to all treats and it's a miracle she was chomping on these from the start. I also have to admit that my husband and I both tried a bite (I am so ashamed!) and both decided that we would happily snack on these any time if we didn't know they were meant for dogs. Your dog will sound so cute crunching away on them!	If you are a lover of Lisa See (I am!), you will likely enjoy Dreams of Joy, too. It's a continuation of Shanghai Girls and you might not understand what's going on unless you've read Shanghai Girls already (and you should read it, anyway). It took me a little longer to get into Dreams of Joy than it has See's other books, but once I was in, I was hooked.  In this novel, we follow Pearl and May's daughter/niece as she takes it upon herself to travel to China. I love that we get to meet the characters we saw in See's previous novel, like Z.G. And everything flows so perfectly from one book to the next, one can't help but think of these characters as real people. I found myself thinking about the book even when I wasn't reading it and wanting to learn more about Communist China.  Dreams of Joy ends in a manner that could call for another book in the series. And if Lisa See keeps writing books (and I hope she does), I will most definitely keep reading them.	1	Pet Supplies--Books

Yes, they're more expensive than other brands, but they last. And really, a mixer is an appliance you should only buy once in your life (my mom still has hers from the 70s and uses it often!). The 5-quart Artisan Series is a classic and comes in a huge variety of colors. Instead of trying to find a place to hide your mixer, you'll be hoping you have enough counter space so that you can keep it our on display!  Not only does this appliance work as a mixer (it comes with a beater, whisk, and very useful dough hook), but I also use it constantly with the KitchenAid ice cream attachment. I keep the ice cream bowl in my freezer and just pop it on the mixer when I'm ready to use. The KitchenAid pasta attachment is also easy to use with the mixer as is the meat grinder.  This mixer does the work for you and will make cooking and baking so much easier. You'll wonder how you ever survived without it!	Ever since I got my MacBook I've been frustrated with the fact there's no card reader on it. I upload a lot of photos and hate having to pull out the camera cord every time I want to upload. When I lost my camera cord, I went to purchase a new one and realized this Flash Memory Card Reader was much cheaper and exactly what I wanted!  Now I can put my camera's memory card into the little reader and stick it into my computer's USB port. The drive is small enough that I can throw it in my purse and have it wherever I go.  Like many other reviewers, after a few months the little blue door broke off on mine too. But it definitely not needed and I've been using the drive for several months without. And if I do need one, it's pretty cheap to replace and so totally worth it!	1	Home and Kitchen--Electronics
A11IKWE7B29TOJ--A11IKWE7B29TOJ	B001F0D11Y--B00C37QN2C	I really like this product, though it's certainly not a cure-all solution. Since starting to use it a few weeks ago, I've noticed my skin is less oily and feels smoother, with less breakouts. Though it's less oily, the face wash is definitely not drying. However, I'm still breaking out from time to time; just a little bit less than usual. I love the way my face feels after washing it with Juice; but beware if you accidentally get any in your mouth. The taste is less than awesome (not that any face wash tastes good... this one just tastes really chemically).  I'll keep using this as it's one of the best face washes I've found.  Update to 5 stars: I've been using this for a few months once a day and just finished my first bottle. My skin has never looked better and I've had far fewer breakouts than ever before. I can't believe I'm spending this amount of money on a face wash (I'm normally a $6.99 Neutrogena girl), but this is so worth it to me.	There's nothing not to like about this parchment paper! I've been buying the precut sheets for the last couple years, but while those are great for the standard cookie sheet (and SO easy!), they're not so great for pans and projects that don't call for that standard size. I love the grid on the parchment, especially for making sure things like cookies and meringues are spaced evenly on the pans. The only thing I don't love is that the cutter on the box isn't the easiest to use perfectly with the grids, so I usually try to cut the parchment with scissors instead (I've never really met a box cutter I liked!).  It's also important to note that you can reuse this parchment paper up to 4 times! I'm not sure if that's true for other parchment brands, but for me, that means 4 batches of baked goods with no waste. By the fourth use, the parchment probably won't be looking too hot and will be browning, but that's OK with me!	1	Luxury Beauty--Home and Kitchen
A11IKWE7B29TOJ--A11IKWE7B29TOJ	B00IJLXDIS--B019PRX3UW	Love this!! It fits perfectly (I'm about 5'2, 100 lbs.) and is super comfortable. It's a tiny bit short, but perfect for a warm summer day. Can be dressed up a bit with heels or down with sandals or cowgirl boots. I will definitely get a lot of use our of this dress this season!	"So, so in love with this!! I'm marking it as ""somewhat small,"" but for me, that is a REALLY good thing! I've had a hard time finding a leather jacket that looks good on me since I'm a bit more petite and they tend to hang on me. But this one is super fitted and looks awesome. It's very stylish and I love the quilting on the sleeves. To me, it looks a lot like real leather and feels like great quality. I'm thrilled with this purchase and think I'll be wearing this jacket for a long time!"	1	Clothing Shoes and Jewelry--Clothing Shoes and Jewelry
A11IKWE7B29TOJ--A11IKWE7B29TOJ	B00XPRQZJ0--B00C37QN2C	"We've been using a burr grinder for years- the Bodum electric one. I wouldn't say I'm a huge expert, but I do know that our coffee has been so much better since investing in a burr (we had a Grind and Brew coffee maker for a while, which allowed us to buy whole beans... But the coffee wasn't great and the machine was a pain). The KitchenAid grinder is a lot more high quality than the Bodum, but that also comes at quite the price (about $99 versus $299).  So, what do I like more about the KitchenAid version? It's a whole lot sleeker looking (the Bodum is plastic) and it looks like something you'd find in a fancy coffee shop. I love the glass canisters for beans and grinds and I can tell it's going to last a lot longer than any other burr grinder we've owned.  And it's quieter, too! This machine has also made a lot less of a mess than our Bodum has. However, the KitchenAid also takes up a lot more room on our counter (which tends to be at a premium!). We also miss the ""timer"" aspect that the Bodum has.  Since we'll likely always be keeping your grinder out on the counter and using daily, I think looks and the amount of mess the machine makes matter a lot!"

A11IKWE7B29TOJ--A11IKWE7B29TOJ	0544829697--0224101994	I loved this book! I often enjoy young adult fiction, but sometimes find it a little too cheesy or unrealistic for my taste. Things I Should Have Known actually felt realistic and true to what teenagers' lives are like these days (man, I sound like such an old lady!). While I can't speak from personal experience, it did also feel like LaZebnik portrayed living with autism in a realistic light and in a different way than how it's usually approached. The relationships and emotions in the book felt very real and as far as I could tell, stereotypes of autism weren't used. More than anything, this felt like a story about the bonds between siblings and if nothing else, will make you think about your own sibling relationships and how things could be different.  While it does deal with more actual issues than most YA novels, this was a quick read for me and one of those books I didn't want to put down. If I had to compare the novel to others in the YA genre, I'd probably say it most reminded me of Jenny Han's summer series. I haven't yet read any of LaZebnik's other novels, but I certainly will now! I also can't help but hope that she'll write a followup to Things I Should Have Known, so we can continue to follow Chloe, Iris, Ethan, and David's stories.	I really enjoyed this book and actually wished that it wasn't so short (it's a super quick read!). While it centers on one main ethical case in the court system, McEwan also briefly explores other court cases and I feel like he could have done so much more to make this book basically a way smarter version of a John Grisham novel (Please note that I'm not comparing this to a Grisham novel at all- McEwan's writing style is much more lyrical and intelligent to me). But I'll have to be happy with what McEwan did give us; which is a beautifully written short novel about, at its simplest, doing what is right both in and out of the court system... Even if there isn't necessarily a right and a wrong.  Despite it being so short, I did feel that McEwan was overly descriptive at times, diving into side stories and other cases. If this were a longer novel, it might have made more sense, but I feel like he was trying to cover a lot in a short space.  I'm not sure that I would compare this to any of McEwan's previous novels... One thing I love about him is that you never know what you're going to get and I'll continue to read everything everything he comes out with!	1	Books--Books

I wanted to be able to move my pictures from my camera to my iPad mini.  However, I was not able to find a camera that I liked that had the Wi-Fi capability.  This card was a great solution to my problem.  The instructions are not great, but there are a lot of helpful videos out there and between the two I was able to get my card up and running with very few difficulties.  The app on the iPhone is not great, but the iPad app is much better.  I tend to transfer my pictures to my iPad and so far this has been working great.  Once I get my pictures to my iPad it is easy to transfer to...well just about anywhere you want.  I have been using this product for almost six months now and it is still working great.  If you want an easy option to make it possible to transfer your pictures from your digital camera to another device wirelessly, this is the perfect product for you.	0	Electronics--Electronics
A11IKWE7B29TOJ--A1Y10U045QKGLG	B00FJ4MLMW--B00A17MJWY	I only have good things to say about these chia seeds as this is my third time ordering them over the past few years. There's no better deal around and they keep well in my pantry until I'm ready to use them. I generally make a smoothie a few times a week and mix chia seeds in... I also sometimes top my yogurt with them and mix them into meatballs and other things. These ones are absolutely perfect and I can't recommend them enough!	Nothing is a great as the real thing but this comes in a close second and to know that it adds fiber back to my diet is extremely helpful. It is a very tasty product. Works in salads, mac & cheese and I used it for elbow spaghetti. Not bad!	0	Grocery and Gourmet Food--Grocery and Gourmet Food
A11IKWE7B29TOJ--A29HU0MGDYBBSI	B013XDLQEO--B00HCLA3PM	Obsessed with this dress!! I'm pretty petite at 5'3, 100 lbs. and sometimes even XXS Lilly fits me large, especially the dresses. But this one is absolutely perfect! It's not tight, but it also doesn't hang on me or look like I'm wearing a potato sack (constant problem for me). I love the blues in the pattern and got so many compliments when I wore this dress to a baby shower.  It's a great dress for casual events (wear with flats) or for dressing up (where with jewelry and heels), so perfect for many occasions. I want to buy every Sophie dress I can find in my size now!	This wig turned out better than I had imagined! For the cost ($10) it's a great quality! It wasn't frizzy and tangled like wigs you find at costume shops. In fact, it was VERY soft! Of course, the long bob wasn't the exact style I was needing so I had to cut and style the wig myself, which was very easy and it turned out great for my costume! Great costume wig! Some people even thought it was my real hair! It's obvious it's a wig once you're in the sunlight, but it's still good quality. I would recommend this wig to anyone who was needing something for costume wear!	0	Clothing Shoes and Jewelry--Clothing Shoes and Jewelry
A11IKWE7B29TOJ--AHVM1K3YGXMAE	B00NGJLCEK--B0017DCQCE	This made my skin feel amazing, though I do have some mixed feelings about it, mostly due to my already oily skin. In the past, I never would have considered putting additional oil on my face, but I heard such great things about this Divine Youth Oil that I decided to try it. It made my skin feel incredible! So silky and smooth. It really just automatically sinks into your skin and feels fabulous. I feel like it gave my skin a little extra glow during the day (I put it on at night) and while it definitely added a little shine, too, it was a glow-y shine that I didn't mind. While some are saying the scent is way too strong, I actually thought it was lovely and I'm usually pretty sensitive to strong smells.  After using it for about a week and a half, I did start to break out more than I usually do. However, I am pretty prone to breakouts, so I can't be certain it was due to the oil. I stopped using it for a couple weeks and my skin is pretty clear now- I'll likely jump back into using it, but will avoid my breakout prone areas. I will definitely report back after using for another extended time period!	Perfect They are the size I needed and they are not outrageously expensive.
