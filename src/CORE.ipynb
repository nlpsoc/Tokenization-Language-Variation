      "How to make a barometer work: to calibrate, compare the movements in millimetres with the changes in reported barometric pressure. Determine how many observed pressure units, either kiloPascals or hundredths of an inch of mercury each millimeter on the ruler represents. For best results, use your barometer indoors where the temperature remains almost constant. How does a barometer work? The mass of air above the water inside the straw does not change, but the increased pressure causes it to occupy a smaller space, provided the temperature does not change. The whole system seems to know how to make a barometer respond. One of Galileo's students, Evangelista Torricelli, wrote We live submerged at the bottom of an ocean of elementary air, which is known by incontestable experiments to have weight . This has become a famous quotation in meteorology. Barometers have been developed to help us determine that weight. Traditional barometers come in two types: Liquid barometers - someone figured out how to make a barometer with a vertical tube containing either water or mercury. If it has mercury, which is far more common, its height changes from around two to nearly three feet at ground level when the atmospheric pressure changes. How often does that happen? Every day, but not by a lot, usually. When people, usually American citizens and pilots, say that the pressure is 29 inches or some number close to that, they are talking about mercury. Most often, this is the height the mercury column would be \n",

      "terror slowly crept up Alex's back, spreading throughout his body - a sickly sweet treacle passively oozing along his arms, to the end of his legs, up his neck and then invading his head. His body felt like it was sinking into his bed; he was heavy and immobile, gripped by paralysis. The man at the end of the bed raised his left hand. In the gnarled and bony fist he held a long, gleaming pair of scissors. Alex's paralysis was broken, but only by an uncontrollable shaking, that ran up and down his body. His breath rasped and jarred, stopped and then forced itself out again. The man knelt down on the end of the bed, and then, on his knees, he moved up the duvet, eventually straddling the shaking body of Alex. Attempting to exert some control, Alex shut his eyes, tight. He felt the weight of the thing on top of him, and then the warmth of the duvet suddenly disappeared and he felt the cold air of the room against his perspiring skin. As Alex opened his eyes he saw the man above him, raising the scissors over his head. It seemed to Alex that the steel blades fell in slow motion. As their tip punctured his wet stomach he was almost calm, watching as a spectator. The blade sunk down, deep into him, releasing a thick red flow of blood. It was an intense coldness, penetrating right into his insides, scraping the edge of his \n",

That will was made known to him by the special revelation granted to him at his conversion, and call to the apostleship; Acts 9 . Paul often refers to the fact that he had received a direct commission from God, and that he did not act on his own authority; compare Galatians 1:11-12 ; 1 Corinthians 9:1-6 ; 2 Corinthians 11:22-33 ; 2 Corinthians 12:1-12 . There was a special reason why he commenced this Epistle by referring to the fact that he was divinely called to the apostleship. It arose from the fact that his apostolic authority had been called in question by the false teachers at Corinth. That this was the case is apparent from the general strain of the Epistle, from some particular expressions 2 Corinthians 10:8-10 ; and from the fact that he is at so much pains throughout the two epistles to establish his divine commission. And Sosthenes - Sosthenes is mentioned in Acts 18:17 , as \"the chief ruler of the synagogue\" at Corinth. He is there said to have been beaten by the Greeks before the judgment-seat of Gallio because he was a Jew, and because he had joined with the other Jews in arraigning Paul, and had thus produced disturbance in the city; see the note on this place.

J] \"It came from listening to a Radio 4 program, appropriately enough, which was hosted by Mr Tom Robinson, of the parish of 6 Music, and he was presenting an archive hour about the release of some national archive films onto the internet for the first time. I just liked the sound of what I heard, so I thought I'd go and have a listen -- not even in a particularly musical sense. I listened to a couple, and I think there was one, 'Coughs And Sneezes Spread Diseases', which kind of grabbed me -- there were a couple of samples that I thought I might just tinker round with. So I made a song, played it to a few people, and unlike nearly everything I'd ever done prior to that, people said they liked it! So I tried making another one after that.\" S] So you thought you were onto something there.
