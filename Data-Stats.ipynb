He began the expedition with his brother Al and three others on a trip up the Yukon River. They commissioned construction of and fitted out a small, shallow-draft sternwheel steamer which they named the New Packet. Schieffelin prospected during the trip in Alaska and found some specks of gold. He was for a while convinced he had found the continental belt he had been searching for. But he was extremely discouraged by the Arctic cold he experienced, up to 50 F below zero (-46 C). He decided that mining in Alaska was a lost cause and he returned to the lower 48 states.\n",

      "{'text': 'It is done, and submitted. You can play “Survival of the Tastiest” on Android, and on the web. Playing on the web works, but you have to simulate multi-touch for table moving and that can be a bit confusing.\\n\\nThere’s a lot I’d like to talk about. I’ll go through every topic, insted of making the typical what went right/wrong list.\\n\\nConcept\\n\\nWorking over the theme was probably one of the hardest tasks I had to face.\\n\\nOriginally, I had an idea of what kind of game I wanted to develop, gameplay wise – something with lots of enemies/actors, simple graphics, maybe set in space, controlled from a top-down view. I was confident I could fit any theme around it.\\n\\nIn the end, the problem with a theme like “Evolution” in a game is that evolution is unassisted. It happens through several seemingly random mutations over time, with the most apt permutation surviving. This genetic car simulator is, in my opinion, a great example of actual evolution of a species facing a challenge. But is it a game?\\n\\nIn a game, you need to control something to reach an objective. That control goes against what evolution is supposed to be like. If you allow the user to pick how to evolve something, it’s not evolution anymore – it’s the equivalent of intelligent design, the fable invented by creationists to combat the very idea of evolution. Being agnostic and a Pastafarian, that’s not something that rubbed me the right way.\\n\\nHence, my biggest dillema when deciding what to create was not with what I wanted to create, but with what I did not. I didn’t want to create an “intelligent design” simulator and wrongly call it evolution.\\n\\nThis is a problem, of course, every other contestant also had to face. And judging by the entries submitted, not many managed to work around it. I’d say the only real solution was through the use of artificial selection, somehow. So far, I haven’t seen any entry using this at its core gameplay.\\n\\nAlas, this is just a fun competition and after a while I decided not to be as strict with the game idea, and allowed myself to pick whatever I thought would work out.\\n\\nMy initial idea was to create something where humanity tried to evolve to a next level but had some kind of foe trying to stop them from doing so. I kind of had this image of human souls flying in space towards a monolith or a space baby (all based in 2001: A Space Odyssey of course) but I couldn’t think of compelling (read: serious) mechanics for that.\\n\\nBorgs were my next inspiration, as their whole hypothesis fit pretty well into the evolution theme. But how to make it work? Are you the borg, or fighting the Borg?\\n\\nThe third and final idea came to me through my girlfriend, who somehow gave me the idea of making something about the evolution of Pasta. The more I thought about it the more it sounded like it would work, so I decided to go with it.\\n\\nConversations with my inspiring co-worker Roushey (who also created the “Mechanical Underdogs” signature logo for my intros) further matured the concept, as it involved into the idea of having individual pieces of pasta flying around and trying to evolve until they became all-powerful. A secondary idea here was that the game would work to explain how the Flying Spaghetti Monster came to exist – by evolving from a normal dinner table.\\n\\nSo the idea evolved more or less into this: you are sitting a table. You have your own plate, with is your “base”. There are 5 other guests at the table, each with their own plate.\\n\\nYour plate can spawn little pieces of pasta. You do so by “ordering” them through a menu. Some pastas are better than others; some are faster, some are stronger. They have varying costs, which are debited from your credits (you start with a number of credits).\\n\\nOnce spawned, your pastas start flying around. Their instinct is to fly to other plates, in order to conquer them (the objective of the game is having your pasta conquer all the plates on the table). But they are really autonomous, so after being spawned, you have no control over your pasta (think DotA or LoL creeps).\\n\\nYour pasta doesn’t like other people’s pasta, so if they meet, they shoot sauce at each other until one dies. You get credits for other pastas your own pasta kill.\\n\\nOnce a pasta is in the vicinity of a plate, it starts conquering it for its team. It takes around 10 seconds for a plate to be conquered; less if more pasta from the same team are around. If pasta from other team are around, though, they get locked down in their attempt, unable to conquer the plate, until one of them die (think Battlefield’s standard “Conquest” mode).\\n\\nYou get points every second for every plate you own.\\n\\nOver time, the concept also evolved to use an Italian bistro as its main scenario.\\n\\nCarlos, Carlos’ Bistro’s founder and owner\\n\\nSetup\\n\\nNo major changes were made from my work setup. I used FDT and Starling creating an Adobe AIR (ActionScript) project, all tools or frameworks I already had some knowledge with.\\n\\nOne big change for me was that I livestreamed my work through a twitch.tv account. This was a new thing for me. As recommended by Roushey, I used a program called XSplit and I got to say, it is pretty amazing. It made the livestream pretty effortless and the features are awesome, even for the free version. It was great to have some of my friends watch me, and then interact with them and random people through chat. It was also good knowing that I was also recording a local version of the files, so I could make a timelapse video later.\\n\\nKnowing the video was being recorded also made me a lot more self-conscious about my computer use, as if someone was watching over my shoulder. It made me realize that sometimes I spend too much time in seemingly inane tasks (I ended up wasting the longest time just to get some text alignment the way I wanted – it’ll probably drive someone crazy if they watch it) and that I do way too many typos where writing code. I pretty much spend half of the time writing a line and the other half fixing the crazy characters in it.\\n\\nMy own stream was probably boring to watch since I was coding for the most time. But livestreaming is one of the cool things to do as a spectator too. It was great seeing other people working – I had a few tabs opened on my second monitor all the time. It’s actually a bit sad, because if I could, I could have spent the whole weekend just watching other people working! But I had to do my own work, so I’d only do it once in a while, when resting for a bit.\\n\\nDesign\\n\\nAlthough I wanted some simple, low-fi, high-contrast kind of design, I ended up going with somewhat realistic (vector) art. I think it worked very well, fitting the mood of the game, but I also went overboard.\\n\\nFor example: to know the state of a plate (who owns it, who’s conquering it and how much time they have left before conquering it, which pasta units are in the queue, etc), you have to look at the plate’s bill.\\n\\nThe problem I realized when doing some tests is that people never look at the bill! They think it’s some kind of prop, so they never actually read its details.\\n\\nPlus, if you’re zoomed out too much, you can’t actually read it, so it’s hard to know what’s going on with the game until you zoom in to the area of a specific plate.\\n\\nOne other solution that didn’t turn out to be as perfect as I thought was how to indicate who a plate base belongs to. In the game, that’s indicated by the plate’s decoration – its color denotes the team owner. But it’s something that fits so well into the design that people never realized it, until they were told about it.\\n\\nIn the end, the idea of going with a full physical metaphor is one that should be done with care. Things that are very important risk becoming background noise, unless the player knows its importance.\\n\\nOriginally, I wanted to avoid any kind of heads-up display in my game. In the end, I ended up adding it at the bottom to indicate your credits and bases owned, as well as the hideous out-of-place-and-still-not-obvious “Call Waiter” button. But in hindsight, I should have gone with a simple HUD from the start, especially one that indicated each team’s colors and general state of the game without the need for zooming in and out.\\n\\nDevelopment\\n\\nDevelopment went fast. But not fast enough.\\n\\nEven though I worked around 32+ hours for this Ludum Dare, the biggest problem I had to face in the end was overscoping. I had too much planned, and couldn’t get it all done.\\n\\nContent-wise, I had several kinds of pasta planned (Wikipedia is just amazing in that regard), split into several different groups, from small Pastina to huge Pasta al forno. But because of time constraints, I ended up scratching most of them, and ended up with 5 different types of very small pasta – barely something to start when talking about the evolution of Pasta.\\n\\nPastas used in the game. Unfortunately, the macs where never used\\n\\nWhich is one of the saddest things about the project, really. It had the framework and the features to allow an endless number of elements in there, but I just didn’t have time to draw the rest of the assets needed (something I loved to do, by the way).\\n\\nOther non-obvious features had to be dropped, too. For example, when ordering some pasta, you were supposed to select what kind of sauce you’d like with your pasta, each with different attributes. Bolognese, for example, is very strong, but inaccurate; Pesto is very accurate and has great range, but it’s weaker; and my favorite, Vodka, would triggers 10% loss of speed on the pasta hit by it.\\n\\nThe code for that is mostly in there. But in the end, I didn’t have time to implement the sauce selection interface; all pasta ended up using bolognese sauce.\\n\\nTo-do list: lots of things were not done\\n\\nActual programming also took a toll in the development time. Having been programming for a while, I like to believe I got to a point where I know how to make things right, but at the expense of forgetting how to do things wrong in a seemingly good way. What I mean is that I had to take a lot of shortcuts in my code to save time (e.g. a lot of singletons references for cross-communication rather than events or observers, all-encompassing check loops, not fast enough) that left a very sour taste in my mouth. While I know I used to do those a few years ago and survive, I almost cannot accept the state my code is in right now.\\n\\nAt the same time, I do know it was the right thing to do given the timeframe.\\n\\nOne small thing that had some impact was using a somewhat new platform for me. That’s Starling, the accelerated graphics framework I used in Flash. I had tested it before and I knew how to use it well – the API is very similar to Flash itself. However, there were some small details that had some impact during development, making me feel somewhat uneasy the whole time I was writing the game. It was, again, the right thing to do, but I should have used Starling more deeply before (which is the conundrum: I used it for Ludum Dare just so I could learn more about it).\\n\\nArgument and user experience\\n\\nOne final aspect of the game that I learned is that making the game obvious for your players goes a long way into making it fun. If you have to spend the longest time explaining things, your game is doing something wrong.\\n\\nAnd that’s exactly the problem Survival of the Tastiest ultimately faced. It’s very hard for people to understand what’s going on with the game, why, and how. I did have some introductory text at the beginning, but that was a last-minute thing. More importantly, I should have had a better interface or simplified the whole concept so it would be easier for people to understand.\\n\\nThat doesn’t mean the game itself should be simple. It just means that the experience and interface should be approachable and understandable.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nI’m extremely happy with what I’ve done and, especially given that this was my first Ludum Dare. However, I feel like I’ve learned a lot of what not to do.\\n\\nThe biggest problem is overscoping. Like Eric Decker said, the biggest lesson we can learn with this is probably with scoping – deciding what to do beforehand in a way you can complete it without having to rush and do something half-assed.\\n\\nI’m sure I will do more Ludum Dares in the future. But if there are any lessons I can take of it, they are to make it simple, to use frameworks and platforms you already have some absolute experience with (otherwise you’ll spend too much time trying to solve easy questions), and to scope for a game that you can complete in one day only (that way, you can actually take two days and make it cool).\\n\\nThis entry was posted\\non Monday, August 27th, 2012 at 10:54 am and is filed under LD #24.\\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\nYou can skip to the end and leave a response.

(assuming the ban was for something rather unforgivable, 20 years is a long time?) \\nThey both could have been in the Order by then, but unlikely given Aberforth's attitude in Deathly Hallows once the trio arrive in Hogsmeade looking for the tiara.  We learn now that a lot of trafficking goes on through the Hogs Head so maybe Dung was trading with Aberforth, Sirius' mirror and various other Black artifacts, he just was not allowed in the pub. \\nAnyone with something in canon or more plausible?\\n\\nA:\\n\\nwhy was he banned?\\nI'm not able to find any canon data on that, either book text search or interviews transcripts.\\n\\nhow is it that he is then speaking to Aberforth in Halfblood Prince?\\nIn HBP, he's speaking to Aberforth, NOT being inside Hog's Head. The topic was selling stuff he stole from Sirius' place:\\n\\nNikki: How did sirius twoway mirror end up with aberforth or is it another twoway mirror?\\n  J.K. Rowling: You see Aberforth meeting Mundungus in Hogsmeade. That was the occasion on which Dung, who had taken Sirius’s mirror from Grimmauld Place, sold it to Aberforth.\\n  (src: J.K. Rowling Interview / The Deathly Hallows Web Chat / July 2007)\\n\\nAs a note - this was important since one of the things sold was the 2-way mirror that Harry used to request help when they were imprisoned at Malfoy's in DH.\\nSo, he was banned from the pub (probably, to avoid causing Aberforth's establishment further trouble), but doesn't mean Aberforth won't talk/do business with him otherwise.\\n\\n\", 'meta': {'pile_set_name': 'StackExchange'}}\n",
      "{'text': 'Working Women, Special Provision and the Debate on Equality\\n\\nThere has been considerable coverage in the media recently about the possibility of offering women in employment paid leave from work during their menstrual period. This has generated a broad range of responses relating to long-standing discussions about ‘equality’ and ‘difference’: is women’s equality best achieved by treating them the same as men or by making provisions that recognise their differences in terms of physiological constitution and biological functions?\\n\\nIf the UK introduces such an initiative, it would not be the first country in the contemporary world to do so. Many countries in Asia already make the provision and Russia debated introducing a law in 2013. The policy also has a significant historical precedent. A whole chapter of my book Women Workers in the Soviet Interwar Economy: From ‘Protection’ to ‘Equality’ (Macmillan, 1999), based on extensive research conducted for my PhD, is devoted to ‘Provision for “Menstrual Leave”’.\\n\\nIn the 1920s, scientific researchers and labour hygiene specialists in the Soviet Union conducted extensive investigations into the impact of menstruation on women’s capacity to work in manual and industrial jobs requiring a significant degree of physical labour. Their recommendations led to two decrees being issued that targeted specific categories of women workers:\\n\\nDecree ‘On the release from work during menstruation of machinists and iron press workers working on cutting machines without mechanised gears in the garment industry’, 11 January 1922\\n\\nDecree ‘On the working conditions of women tractor and lorry drivers’, 9 May 1931\\n\\nThese decrees arose from research that suggested, amongst other things, that inadequate seating at machines and on tractors resulted in congestion and tension in the abdomen that was exacerbated during menstruation. In practice, the decrees did not provide for regular absence from work. Women seeking to benefit from the provision had to provide a doctor’s note, similar to the usual requirements for sick leave.\\n\\nThe official research into the impact of menstruation on women’s capacity to work and the application of the decrees in practice raised a number of issues on both sides of the argument. I offer only a summary of the contemporary research findings and observer commentary here:\\n\\nFor the provision:\\n• employers have a responsibility to protect the health of their workers and unhealthy, poor and inadequate working environments can have a detrimental impact on women’s reproductive health\\n• women’s labour productivity and output would rise as a result\\n• it is essential to protect the professionalism of certain categories of workers: the debates here centred on performance artists and female theatrical employees engaged in highly physical and intensely emotional work\\n• heavy physical labour and strenuous exercise can lead to disruptions of the menstrual cycle\\n• women’s physical and intellectual capacities are reduced during menstruation; women lose muscular strength and powers of concentration\\n• women’s biological constitution and reproductive functions require specific recognition in law\\n\\nAgainst the provision:\\n• employers are less likely to appoint women if they are guaranteed paid time off work during menstruation\\n• (often from male workers, who viewed the employment of women as competition) women should not be employed in jobs for which they lack the physical strength and mental capacity\\n• if necessary, women could be transferred to different tasks involving easier work during menstruation\\n• the provision would be open to uneven application and abuse\\n• women cannot expect to be considered equal with men if they are given special treatment in the law\\n\\nIt is worth noting also that the various research projects often revealed that the vast majority of women reported no regular problems or abnormalities with menstruation, and that men commonly reported higher levels of sickness than their female colleagues. Many of the problems experienced by women in the workplace could be mitigated by the introduction of improvements to their physical working conditions (not sitting down or standing up in the same position for long periods of time) or by the simple introduction of very short breaks that would allow women to walk around and get some exercise.\\n\\nDebates in the UK, on the TV and in the press, are unlikely to reach a consensus on this issue.

And you’re going to have to practice patience even more as your toddler learns to become more independent.\\n\\nFor example, she tells you she can’t finish the puzzle she’s doing. Instead of jumping right in and telling her which piece goes where, you’re going to have to tell her you’ll help a little. Go ahead and help, but let her do a lot of it herself, and make sure she’s the one to finish the job. That will give her a sense of accomplishment and the confidence to try again next time.\\n\\nRemember that children each progress at their own rate.

For sure, i guess...        At least for Praha I'm pretty sure :) It's sooooo beautiful! I'm still sad, because i visited Praha some years ago in a cold Autumn, without my proper Digicam and nearly all the places were pretty deserted, which would habe been fantastic for pictures :-(        I thought Königsberg is at least important for the Russian Navy, for being an ice free Navy Port in the Baltic Sea?\", \"“Used to. We’re not kids anymore, Tai. You _have_ a kid, you can’t act like you’re still some party guy on the coolest team at Beacon anymore—and that’s not what this is, anyways. You drink to try and forget her, you still end up in that old diner where you had your first date moping every other week—she was my _sister,_ Tai. She’s been there my _entire_ life, I feel empty without her around because I’ve never had to be without her; I know that it hurts, but you have to move forward, man. Yang deserves better than a dad who can’t stop wallowing in the past and missing someone who left on her own.”\\n_Summer deserves better than to be second to Raven’s shadow._\\n“Qrow…”\\nQrow shook his head, sighing once more. “Just—promise you’re gonna try to move on, man. Give a life without Raven—a _happy_ one—a chance. Okay?”\\n“Why do you care so much?” The question caught Qrow a little off guard, and _‘because I’m in love with Summer and I think she might be falling for you and I want you to make her happy_ ’ seemed like a terrible response. Taiyang watched him expectantly, and with a shrug, Qrow found another answer that was just as true.\\n“Because Yang’s my niece, and because you’re practically my brother. You’re my teammate, and my friend, and I’ve got to be honest, man, I hate seeing you like this. I know you, and I know you deserve more happiness than this. I just… want to see things get better for you.”\\nThey were both quiet for a few moments, and then Taiyang finally spoke. “I’ll… try, man, if you really think it’s better for Yang. But don’t make it sound so easy.”\\n“It’s not easy and I know it. Like I said—she’s my twin, it’s hard for me, too. But trying’s all we can do, and when it gets hard—when you need help, just… don’t be afraid to talk to Summer and I. Don’t be afraid to ask for help or vent—don’t rush to drink or fall apart, okay?” Pausing, Qrow started to stand again, adding earnestly, “We’re here for you, brother.”\\nHe was halfway to the door when Taiyang’s confused voice halted him. “You dyin’, Qrow?”\\nDropping his head, Qrow chuckled a little. He knew that he and Taiyang didn’t often make a habit of offering emotional talks like this, but—well, it didn’t take a death to make him get over that.\\nApparently, it just took him worrying about Summer’s happiness.\\n“No, man. Just worried about you, is all. Summer is, too. Sleep tight, Tai.”\\nFaint smile still on his face, slowly shifting to a rueful one, Qrow slipped back out of the room and made his way down the hallway once more.\\n**Notes for the Chapter:**\\n> I felt ridiculous for using 'bro' and 'man' so much during that talk, but you know these two can’t have an emotional conversation without using a surplus of those words as like a ‘we’re still manly despite our emotions tho’ and ‘no homo tho’ disclaimer.\\n>\\n> Thank you so much for reading!

Thus he may ascribe his unhappiness to something fixed and unalterable in his character or his environment: he has a 'sad disposition', or he has been treated badly by other people. Alternatively, it can be that he portrays himself under grandiloquent labels that somehow determine his place and destiny in the world: for example, the 'unfortunate individual', the 'tragic hero'. Again, and more generally, he may take refuge in a Romantic _Weltschmerz_ , using a tone of disillusioned pessimism and treating questions of practical decision as if they could be of no final significance; whatever a man does he will end up regretting. In all such ideas it is possible to find a spurious tranquillity; one can even take a quiet pride in them. For their eventual issue is 'an out and out fatalism, which always has something seductive about it' (EO ii, 241); by accepting a fatalistic or necessitarian viewpoint, the individual tacitly absolves himself from accountability for his condition as well as from an obligation to do anything about it. It is implied, however, that this is never more than a pretence, a cover, behind which he conceals his unavowed determination to remain at a stage from which he could, if he chose, release himself.\\n All in all, <PERSON>'s analysis of aestheticism is conducted with a psychological subtlety and an elaborate attention to detail that defy brief summary, and it has been possible here only to pick out some of its leading themes. As I have already indicated, he employed his basic categories in an extremely elastic way. This allowed him to point up unexpected connections between apparently diverse phenomena in a manner that can be genuinely illuminating; even so, there are times when his extended use of them seems to put their determinate significance in jeopardy, and a reader of 'Equilibrium' may be excused if he occasionally wonders if there is anything that could not, with a little ingenuity, be interpreted as 'living aesthetically'. Nor is this the sole problem which it poses. For it is not always clear whether <PERSON> is speaking of the aesthetic consciousness in quite general terms or whether, on the other hand, he is concerned with some specific manifestation of it that was of particular relevance to his own period and culture. There can, however, be no question that he supposed much of what he said to bear upon contemporary currents of thought and behaviour. At one point, for instance, it is explicitly stated that 'aesthetic melancholy', the failure 'to will deeply and sincerely', is a sickness under which 'all young Germany and France now sighs' (EO ii 193). And there are also discernible parallels between the judge's account of certain typical aesthetic attitudes and <PERSON>'s later strictures, in _The Present Age_ and elsewhere, on other tendencies implicit in the prevalent social ethos of his time: absorption in the 'outward', the external; absence of a clear sense of individual identity and responsibility; complacent acquiescence in deterministic myths as opposed to serious practical commitment; a pervasive cult of indifference presenting\", 'Mumbai: Usha Narayanan, executive director of market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) and a member of its takeover regulation advisory committee (Trac), aired her views in an interview last week on issues of control and triggers with regard to mergers and acquisitions.

It's a disc that you insert, and then you go to a website (Columbia House I think?) and try to redeem it. The only issue is that they no longer have Iron Man 2 as a choice...so if you want a digital copy, just save yourself the hassle and just buy the Amazon VOD version. At least you'll get it on Disney Movies Anywhere and play it from basically any streaming device.  ----- Original Review:  I was a huge fan of the first Iron Man movie, and could not wait for the sequel. Having rented Iron Man 2 at Amazon VOD, I was surprised at how little action there was, when compared to the first movie. The majority of the action takes place in the last quarter of the movie.  Now don't misunderstand me, this was a good movie and a good sequel, but I don't feel that it was better than the original. Some of the side stories were interesting, but this movie felt more like a setup for the Avengers movie. <PERSON> was pretty good as <PERSON>, and <PERSON> was a suitable replacement for <PERSON>, though I would have preferred that <PERSON> swallowed his pride and kept the original cast in place for the sequel. Unfortunately <PERSON> didn't receive enough screen time in my opinion.  All in all the movie was a 3.5-4.0, compared to my 5 star rating for Iron Man. It was a good movie, but <PERSON> could have done better.\", \"Thank you so much for all your help! I can now add books to my system.

If you want to say \"This thing,\" you\\'d say, \"这个东西\". If you want to say, \"This much,\" you\\'d say, \"这么多\".\\nI understand the reasons for the 只 and the 个, but what does the 么 really mean?\\n\\nA:\\n\\n么 has lost most of its lexical meaning in modern usage, but it appears to have originally been derived from the word 物, meaning \\'thing\\'. Chinese by Jerry Norman, pp. 119-20 makes mention of the etymology of various modern words featuring 么:\\n\\nIn an insightful article, Zhāng Hùiyīng (1982) has shown that shénme 什么, the standard modern word for \\'what\\', comes from shí wù 什物 (MC źjəp mjuət). This form (in a number of different phonological shapes) makes its first appearance in the Tang dynasty. Shí wù 什物 originally meant \\'vessels, household utensils, things (of various sorts)\\'. The development of a interrogative meaning \\'what\\' from a meaning \\'thing\\' finds a parallel in modern Italian, where cosa \\'thing\\' is also used to mean \\'what\\'. ...\\n...\\n[Regarding \\'how\\'...] In the late Tang and Wudai periods, a different form begins to be found; it consists of the verb zuò 作 (MC tsuo-) plus one of several variants of the morpheme meaning \\'thing, what\\' discussed in relation to the origins of modern shénme 什么 ... In the Wudai period, a fusion word zěn 怎 (from an earlier *zěm) based on these forms appears for the first time. It is this fusion form that is directly ancestral to the modern zěnme 怎么 \\'how\\'. Zhème 这么 \\'in this way\\' and nàme 那么 \\'in that way\\' were probably analogically based on this form.\\n\\nNotes:\\n\\nThe article by Zhāng Hùiyīng 张惠英 referenced in that excerpt refers to an article entitled 释「什么」in《中国语文》1982年第4期, pp. 302-5. I wasn\\'t easily able to obtain a copy of that article though.\\nMC in that excerpt refers to how the words were pronounced in Middle Chinese (ca. 600-1000 AD).\\n\\nWhile it\\'s interesting that 么 in these words was derived from a word meaning \\'thing\\', it\\'s essentially a bound morpheme that is no longer productive and can\\'t be used on its own. In effect, its modern usage doesn\\'t have any particular meaning in practice. In many ways, it could be considered a cranberry morpheme.\\n\\n', '<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\\n<!-- NewPage

is.\" \"Confirm with a blood smear and ADAMTS13 antibodies.\" \"Dr. James Wilson, please dial 558.\" \"Can you cure it?\" \"TTP isn\\'t completely curable, but the symptoms are manageable with the proper treatment.\" \"Is this the treatment?\" \"No.\" \"First we need to do a blood test to confirm the diagnosis.\" \"But he\\'s gonna get better?\" \"Honey, that\\'s what she\\'s saying.\" \"I\\'m gonna be okay.\" \"Don\\'t worry.\" \"How can\\'t I worry?\" \"You\\'re in the hospital.\" \"I\\'m gonna be fine.\" \"Are you sure everything was fine before?\" \"I mean, given your educational background, you\\'d think you could at least find a job with a medical plan.\" \"We have money.\" \"Don\\'t worry.\" \"It\\'s not that.\" \"It\\'s just I want to make sure we have all the information we should.\" \"My husband wouldn\\'t lie.\" \"It\\'s okay, baby.\" \"He\\'s just doing his job.\" \"He just wants to make sure I\\'m not a secret drug addict or an alcoholic.\" \"Or hiding a history of mental illness.\" \"I work as a courier because I want to.\" \"It\\'s easy.\" \"I don\\'t have to think.\" \"It\\'s too hard to think?\" \"No.\" \"Just unpleasant.\" \"No matter what I did, it really wasn\\'t good enough.\" \"Then I met Dara.\" \"She didn\\'t care how smart I was, or what I might accomplish in the future.\" \"It was the first time in my life that I was really happy.\" \"So

to...\" \"I know what you\\'re doing, and I appreciate it.\" \"But I\\'ve got it under control.\" \"That\\'s what you said about the Dibala incident, and obviously you didn\\'t.\" \"And talking about it obviously made things so much better.\" \"Didn\\'t you think there was something weird about that guy?\" \"Not really.\" \"In fact, he seemed pretty normal.\" \"That\\'s my point.\" \"Guys with IQs

it\\'s not TTP.\" \"And he wants to see how long it takes us to catch up to him.\" \"Schistocytes suggest TTP.\" \"Good, now what?\" \"Normally we\\'d try plasmapheresis, but the patient has an albumin colloid allergy.\" \"So?\" \"So that means we have to give him a splenectomy.\" \"Yes, it does.\" \"Wilson?\" \"No.\" \"Do you know where he is?\" \"Not in here.\" \"You\\'re sure you want us to take out his spleen?\" \"Is that what a splenectomy is?\" \"I thought it was an ice cream treat.\" \"Yuck.\" \"So you do really think he has TTP.\" \"You\\'re not just testing us.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Like I have time for games.\" \"So, why did you really take this case?\" \"Isn\\'t it obvious?\" \"I\\'m fishing for a dinner invite.\" \"Missed you at breakfast this morning.\" \"And lunch.\" \"I

great.\" \"So, he\\'s all better?\" \"Probably be on some long-term meds, and he\\'s about 10 ounces lighter, other than that, he won\\'t even know it\\'s gone.\" \"Did you hear that, honey?\" \"You\\'re gonna be just fine.\" \"When can I get out of here?\" \"If everything checks out, less than a week.\" \"Good. \\'Cause those boxes aren\\'t gonna deliver colors.\" \"Colors?\" \"Green and

okay.\" \"On both the food and friends.\" \"Mice.\" \"Leptospirosis could explain the ataxia and the anemia.\" \"But not without a fever.\" \"You have someone to talk to?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Who?\" \"What,

is, is this a bad agenda or a good one?\" \"Either you\\'re trying to screw with me, or you\\'re trying to show me that you\\'ve really changed.\" \"So which is it?\" \"I\\'m dying to know.\" \"What are you doing for Thanksgiving dinner?\" \"Peace in our time!\" \"Only cost me 45 minutes of clinic duty.\" \"This is a three-hour drive.\" \"Have you considered the possibility that this is a fake

biopsy can wait until after Thanksgiving.\" \"Yes, assuming the biopsy is going to tell us exactly what we expect it to tell us, it can wait till after New Years.\" \"On the other hand, Taub and

you just hide vodka around the house for fun.\" \"I drink, just not a lot.\" \"Since when do you drink at all?\" \"I have one shot when I get home from work, baby.\" \"That\\'s it.\" \"So why lie to your wife about it?\" \"Because it\\'s not important.\" \"What difference does it make?\" \"That you drink every day, by yourself?\" \"I have one lousy drink, okay?\" \"Have you ever seen me drunk?\" \"Ever?\" \"No, but you\\'ve obviously been drinking enough to hurt your liver.\" \"My liver is fine.\" \"Hold still.\" \"There we go.\" \"This test is a waste of time.\" \"Hey.\" \"This wine?\" \"All right.\" \"Very good.\" \"There, we got this...\" \"String beans?\" \"Julia?\" \"No, I\\'m the house sitter.\" \"They\\'re in Hawaii for the week.\" \"Happy Thanksgiving.\" \"Happy Thanksgiving, you

albumin, 7.2.\" \"That\\'s it?\" \"Everything else is fine.\" \"So it was a waste of time.\" \"Unless, it\\'s not his liver that\\'s elevating his albumin, it\\'s his kidneys.\" \"Renal failure.\" \"Explains the anemia.\" \"If he developed hyperkalemia, that would explain the ataxia, but the stroke...\" \"Ischemic encephalopathy.\" \"Nice.\" \"Except now we have to stay and test his kidneys.\" \"Key under the mat.\" \"There\\'s no key under the mat.\" \"Oh, right.\" \"You need to replace one of your kitchen windows.\" \"I helped myself to your wine cellar.\" \"I\\'ll leave a buck on the way out.\" \"You\\'re not right for her.\" \"And you are?\" \"Less wrong.\" \"Ah.\" \"But then I started thinking...\" \"What was I saying?\" \"You were saying it\\'s late and...\" \"She invited me.\" \"She didn\\'t know if she should.\" \"She was trying to figure out if I really have changed or if I\\'m still the same old SOB I\\'ve always been.\" \"But she always gave me a chance.\" \"Eight hundred and thirty-two chances, and I used up every one of them.\" \"Eight hundred and thirty-two\\'s her limit, make a note.\" \"How about a cup of coffee?\" \"It\\'s just instant, but...\" \"I\\'m pathetic.\" \"I don\\'t deserve her.\" \"Okay.\" \"Okay.\" \"All right.\" \"Here.\" \"Maybe you should crash here.\" \"It\\'s a sofa bed.\" \"I love her.\" \"Patient\\'s liver is fine, it\\'s his

trust you had a wonderful Thanksgiving.\" \"I don\\'t remember.\" \"So I guess I did.\" \"Multiple myeloma.\" \"No bone pain.\" \"You got drunk alone?\" \"No.\" \"That would be a sign that I need to talk to you about this.\" \"Polycystic kidney disease.\" \"No UTIs or flank pain.\" \"Well, what if his cough is more than just a cold?\" \"He hasn\\'t been coughing.\" \"It\\'s in his history, and we found a new bottle of cough syrup in his medicine cabinet.\" \"Cough could mean Goodpasture Syndrome, affects kidneys and lungs.\" \"Start him on immunosuppressors and dialysis.\" \"We\\'ll do it right after we run it by House.\" \"He\\'s not answering his pager.\" \"Looks like he\\'s leaving it up to us.\" \"Us.\" \"Not you.\" \"And since we don\\'t disagree, you can save your fight for another case.\" \"How long do I have to be hooked up for?\" \"Four to six hours a day until we see an improvement.\" \"What if you don\\'t?\" \"Then we keep doing it until he gets a transplant.\" \"You were sure it was his spleen, and then you were sure it was his liver, which he told you it wasn\\'t, and now you\\'re sure it\\'s his kidneys.\" \"It\\'s definitely his kidneys.\" \"We just don\\'t know why it\\'s his kidneys.\" \"Any word from Cameron?\" \"Nope.\" \"I started seeing a counselor after my diagnosis.\" \"She\\'s really good.\" \"Why does everyone assume that everyone works in the exact same way?\" \"We pretty much do.\" \"Our egos want us to think we\\'re all snowflakes, no two alike, but really, we all want the same things, love, forgiveness, chocolate.\" \"Well, what I want is for everyone to leave me alone.\" \"How do I get that?\" \"What did you say to Lucas last night?\" \"I know there were a lot of consonants.\" \"I don\\'t remember how I got here, never mind what I said.\" \"Well, I just talked to him.\" \"And he said he thought it\\'d be better if we stopped seeing each other.\" \"Said he didn\\'t realize how much there still was between you and me.\" \"And he didn\\'t want to get caught in the middle of us.\" \"I was drunk.\" \"Whatever I said, he can\\'t really...\" \"I\\'ve had enough, House.\" \"I actually felt bad about scamming you, but then you lived down to my expectations, and then some.\" \"There is no us.\" \"There never will be.\" \"It worked.\" \"Please tell me you\\'re talking about a medical procedure.\" \"They split up this morning.\" \"You\\'re the very first one I\\'ve told.\" \"And you think she\\'ll start dating you?\" \"I\\'m sure she hates you.\" \"But her eyes say,\" \"\"How will I ever pay you for that tennis lesson?\"\" \"What a shame.\" \"They\\'ll get over it.\" \"I meant for you.\" \"I\\'ll get over it faster than they do.\" \"I can\\'t believe that Lucas fell for my\" \"\"I\\'d never say this because it\\'s so personal\" \"\"except that I\\'m drunk\" profession of love.\" \"Second oldest trick in the book.\" \"You\\'re right.\" \"It\\'s his fault because he\\'s stupid.\" \"He certainly is.\" \"You\\'re stupid.\" \"Well, I\\'m rubber and you\\'re glue...\" \"He\\'s not pedestrian, he\\'s stupid.\" \"Or at least stupider than he should be.\" \"He\\'s a DXM junkie.\" \"Dextromethorphan.\" \"As in cough syrup?\" \"He wasn\\'t taking it for his cough.\" \"It\\'s cheap, available at your corner drugstore, and taken in high doses, it\\'s a dumb drug.\" \"Dumb drug?\" \"He obviously hasn\\'t...\" \"He\\'s smart compared to you, he\\'s a moron compared to what he was.\" \"Robotripping lowers the IQ, it also causes brain damage.\" \"Unless taken with the proper amount of ethanol, about one drink per day.\" \"He wasn\\'t abusing the booze and taking the cough remedy medicinally, he was abusing the cough meds and taking the booze medicinally.\" \"Bravo.\" \"Why would you do that?\" \"If you had a gift, why would you just throw it away?\" \"I didn\\'t throw it away.\" \"I just turned it down a little.\" \"When my brain was on low, everything didn\\'t seem so miserable any more.\" \"Life was bearable.\" \"I thought that I did that.\" \"You do.\" \"Long-term abuse of DXM explains all your symptoms.\" \"Even, oh, sweet irony, your cough.\" \"Whole bowel lavage, activated charcoal.\" \"We get all traces of it out of your system, you\\'ll be the unhappiest little courier in no time.\" \"I don\\'t think I can live without it.\" \"You\\'d be surprised what you can live without.\" \"Make him a genius.\" \"I can\\'t believe it.\" \"He looks so much better already.\" \"We were thinking about calling GQ.\" \"Lavage has removed all traces of DXM from his body.\" \"You\\'re drawing again.\" \"What is it?\" \"Just doodles.\" \"No, it\\'s not.\" \"Come on, Jimmy, I want to know.\" \"This is a toroidal helicon plasma device.\" \"It determines the amount of energy expended by the subatomic particles.\" \"I\\'m thirsty.\" \"Could you get me a juice or something?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Of course.\" \"I\\'m so happy, Jimmy.\" \"I told you.\" \"You know what the difference between her IQ and mine is?\" \"91 points.\" \"In relation, she\\'s closer to a gibbon than she is to me.\" \"Having sex with her would be an act of bestiality.\" \"I assume you didn\\'t marry her for her skill in Applied Physics.\" \"I just wish she could spell it.\" \"You really think you\\'d be happier with someone who could spell better?\" \"No.\" \"That\\'s the problem.\" \"I\\'m the one who\\'s a jerk.\" \"But I owe her everything.\" \"I want to want to be with her.\" \"And when I\\'m clear, I...\" \"I can\\'t.\" \"Fainting, dizziness, shortness of breath?\" \"Sometimes.\" \"Is the wait always this long?\" \"Only on days that end in \"day.\" \"\" Diarrhea, weight loss?\" \"A bit.\" \"Don\\'t you ever shave?\" \"Yeah, once a week.\" \"How about you?\" \"Stomach pain, tenderness?\" \"Every now and then.\" \"Are you this rude to all your patients?\" \"Oh, yes, don\\'t think you\\'re special.\" \"So we got a lot of vague, unverifiable symptoms, yet all the physical signs are perfectly normal.\" \"What do you think I have?\" \"I\\'m not sure, but I think it\\'s a lame job.\" \"What?\" \"You\\'re a rat.\" \"Insurance company sends you out to check on the quality of medical care.\" \"That\\'s ridiculous.\" \"Is it really?\" \"\\'Cause you seem a lot more interested in asking questions than answering them.\" \"Handwriting in your medical records is obviously not a doctor\\'s, \\'cause I can almost read it.\" \"And when you went out for a urine sample, I looked in your purse.\" \"Found the list of questions you were supposed to memorize before you came to the clinic.\" \"I was looking for gum.\" \"You\\'re an ass.\" \"Put it in your report.\" \"I\\'ll tell you what.\" \"I\\'ll give you 20 bucks if you\\'ll pretend that I\\'m not when we leave this

\"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" \"Sorry, can\\'t remember if I\\'ve mocked you yet for being a male nurse.\" \"I think this counts.\" \"Fair enough.\" \"That isn\\'t the man I married.\" \"Yes, he is.\" \"He\\'s just smarter.\" \"Give him some time.\" \"I\\'m sure...\" \"He hates me.\" \"His body is going through withdrawal.\" \"He\\'s adjusting.\" \"Maybe he never loved me.\" \"Not really.\" \"Maybe we never

\"Which ribs did you break in the fall?\" \"Down the left side?\" \"Yeah, bottom three.\" \"But that was 12 years ago.\" \"This probably cost me my marriage, so it better be awesome.\" \"Ferrous oxide contrast?\" \"It gets absorbed by the spleen, unless he doesn\\'t have one, in which case it\\'s absorbed by the liver and fries that.\" \"You\\'re killing him?\" \"You think I opened him up and didn\\'t take out his spleen?\" \"All organs do look kind of the same, red and squishy.\" \"Oh, my God.\" \"Accessory spleens.\" \"Okay, that is amazing.\" \"Twelve years, eight stories and a dumpster ago, he broke three ribs, damaged his spleen.\" \"Bits of it split off, circulated through his blood stream until they landed and attached somewhere else.\" \"So, it is TTP.\" \"I just didn\\'t remove

deserved it.\" \"Well, if I thought that, I wouldn\\'t be apologizing.\" \"Your fist slipped?\" \"Everybody kept bugging me, asking if I was okay.\" \"So you bust my nose to keep people off your back?\" \"Pretty much.\" \"Making people even more worried about you.\" \"Maybe.\" \"But at least they\\'re not talking to me about it.\" \"Fair enough.\" \"Cheers.\" \"Thank you.\" \"Don\\'t be so grateful.\" \"You\\'ll be delivering packages for 70 years to pay for it.\" \"Well, thanks for our talk.\" \"It\\'s been a while since I had a stimulating conversation.\" \"So what are you going to do?\" \"Go back to my life.\" \"Which one?\" \"The one that has my wife in it.\" \"Robotripping.\" \"How does she feel about that?\" \"Well, she doesn\\'t have to know.\" \"It\\'s worked for 12

All three were\\ndressed in white, and looked as delightfully cool, sweet and airy, with\\ntheir floating white ribbons and wind-blown curls, as summer maidens\\ncan possibly look.\\n\\n\"If I were an artist, I would immortalize that glorious scene,\" cried\\nLily Ryder, her blue eyes sparkling with the fire of enthusiasm.\\n\\n\"And if I were an artist, I would paint _you_,\" cried a handsome,\\nfair-haired young man _sotto voce_, who had stopped short in his stroll\\nalong the sands with his friend, to admire the three lovely young\\ngirls, feeling sure that his keen scrutiny would not be observed, they\\nwere gazing so intently out to sea.\\n\\n\"Who are they, Ravenswood?\" he asked, eagerly, turning to his\\ncompanion. \"You know everyone at Newport worth knowing, of course--\\'a\\ngolden key throws open all doors.\\'\"\\n\\n\"Oh, of course,\" echoed Philip Ravenswood, with the slow drawl habitual\\nto him. \"They are called at Newport \\'The Three Graces.\\' The blonde\\nfairy to the right is Lily Ryder, an ex-governor\\'s daughter. The\\nbewitching girl in the center of the group is Miss Hildegarde Cramer,\\na banker\\'s daughter; and, by the way, she\\'s one of the jolliest girls\\nthat ever dazzled a fellow\\'s wits as well as his eyes--looks more\\nbewitching every time you see her.\"\\n\\n\"But who is the other young girl?\" interrupted his companion,\\nimpatiently. \"According to my ideas of feminine loveliness, she\\'s far\\nthe prettiest of the three.\"\\n\\n\"Hold on, my dear Royal Ainsley, lest you provoke a duel here and now.\\nRemember, that trio contains the peerless Hildegarde,\" laughed Philip\\nRavenswood, relighting a fresh Havana.\\n\\n\"All allowance made for difference of opinion,\" smiled Ainsley; \"but\\nreally, Phil, who is the dark-eyed beauty this way?\"\\n\\nLittle dreaming of what would come of those few idly spoken words,\\nPhilip Ravenswood answered, carelessly:\\n\\n\"Her name is Ida May. She\\'s the only living relative of the Mays of\\nBoston, I understand. I do not know the Mays personally, but know them\\nwell by reputation. They are fabulously rich, it is generally believed.\"\\n\\n\"Suppose you introduce me to the Three Graces,\" said Royal Ainsley,\\nbanteringly.\\n\\nHis companion flushed, and looked a trifle uncomfortable.\\n\\n\"At another time, my dear fellow,\" he said, answering Ainsley\\'s\\nquestion after a moment\\'s pause. \"Let the girls enjoy their rhapsodies\\nover the sunset in peace this time. We really haven\\'t time just now.\\nThe fellows are waiting for us at the club, you know.\"\\n\\nBut Ainsley refused to go on; yet he did it in such a gay, off-hand,\\nrollicking, fun-loving fashion, his friend did not see the fixed\\npurpose in his action.\\n\\nHe was quite sure that if they stood there long enough they could not\\nhelp attracting the attention of the pretty maidens, and there was\\nno time like the present to meet them. In this surmise, he was quite\\ncorrect. Attracted by the sound of voices almost behind them, Miss\\nRyder glanced around.\\n\\n\"Hildegarde--Ida!\" she exclaimed, in a flutter of delighted surprise,\\n\"why, here is Mr. Ravenswood!\"\\n\\nShe stopped short, for just then she observed that the handsome young\\ngentleman in the white linen suit, standing a little apart from Mr.\\nRavenswood, was with him.\\n\\nIt was too late to beat a retreat then, for he had been discovered. He\\nwas certainly in for it, and there was no help for it but to bring his\\ncompanion forward with the best possible grace and present him to the\\nyoung ladies.\\n\\nAinsley bowed low in his most charming manner, raising, with a smile,\\nhis white straw hat from his fair, clustering hair, and Philip\\nRavenswood could see, with consternation, the apparent admiration for\\nhis friend on all three girlish faces, including Hildegarde, whom he\\nhad believed to be quite smitten with himself.\\n\\nRoyal Ainsley made the most of that next half hour on the sands. He was\\nso brilliant, so witty, so clever, he fairly astonished his friend,\\nused as he was to his gay _bon-mots_ and to see him the life of all\\nthe affairs at the club.\\n\\nThey chatted brightly enough, until Hildegarde exclaimed, with a little\\ncry:\\n\\n\"Why, there is some bell striking seven! We have been here over an\\nhour. We must get back to the hotel, girls, or we will never be dressed\\nfor dinner. Won\\'t you stroll back that way with us?\" she added, with a\\ndazzling smile to both of the young gentlemen.\\n\\n\"I think not,\" replied Ainsley, quickly, taking it upon himself to\\nanswer for his friend. \"We have an engagement, and have barely time to\\nsave ourselves from being the annoying cause of giving our friends a\\ncold dinner.\"\\n\\n\"We hope to see you both soon again,\" said Lily, with another blush.\\n\\n\"We do, indeed!\" echoed Hildegarde, archly. But the girl with the\\nvelvet <DW29> eyes made no audible remark, though her crimson lips\\nparted, then shut quickly again.\\n\\nThe next moment the two gentlemen were gone, and the three young girls\\nretraced their steps slowly hotelward along the beach. They had a much\\npleasanter subject to discuss now than the sunset.\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t the new-comer handsome?\" remarked Lily.\\n\\n\"Splendid! but not quite as Phil, though.\"\\n\\nAgain they both asked together:\\n\\n\"What say _you_, Ida?\"\\n\\nThe girl with cheeks like a damask rose and velvety <DW29> eyes blushed\\nto the roots of her jetty curls.\\n\\n\"He is like the hero of a novel. I have never seen any one so handsome\\nbefore--so fair, so smiling--so--so--delightful,\" she answered.\\n\\n\"Ida May\\'s heart has been hit by the first shot of those arrows of blue\\neyes,\" laughed Lily, mockingly. \"I knew when she declared that, come\\nwhat would, she would not fall in love with any young man she met at\\nNewport, she was more than likely to meet her fate.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II.\\n\\n\\nFor some moments the two young men walked on in silence, which was at\\nlast broken by Ainsley.\\n\\n\"I say, Phil,\" he began, eagerly, laying his hand on his friend\\'s\\nshoulder, \"do you think any one of those three beauties would accept\\nan invitation to go down and see the yacht-race with me to-morrow\\nafternoon?\"\\n\\nRavenswood looked shocked.\\n\\n\"You are surely jesting to ask my opinion as to whether any one of\\nthose young girls would accompany _a stranger_ to a place of amusement.\\nYou certainly know, as well as I do, that they wouldn\\'t entertain such\\na thought for an instant. And even suppose they did? Their parents\\nwould soon let you know what _they_ thought on the subject. Like all\\nsweet rosebuds, they are guarded by thorns. A very stern _duenna_\\nusually accompanies them on their afternoon rambles, and woe to\\nanything masculine who attempts to hold a few moments\\' conversation\\nwith any one of them. I confess I was surprised to find them alone\\nto-day--very much surprised, I must say.\"\\n\\n\"Fate interposed in my behalf,\" laughed Ainsley, nonchalantly; adding:\\n\"I tell you, Phil, I am a strong believer in fate, no matter what\\nany one says to the contrary, believing with the poet--everything is\\npreordained, planned out ahead for us, and we can not escape it.\\nWe are to meet certain people. One girl makes no impression upon us\\nwhatever, no matter how pretty she may be; we meet another, and lo!\\nwith the first glance from her eyes, the mischief\\'s done--_we_ are done\\nfor. Now, am I not correct?\"\\n\\n\"I hope you have not made such a fool of yourself as to fall in love at\\nfirst sight with any one of those young ladies to whom I was mad enough\\nto introduce you, Ainsley!\" cried Ravenswood, very much nettled.\\n\\n\"And why not, pray?\" returned Royal Ainsley, coolly. \"You should blame\\nfate if I have done so, not me, my dear fellow.\"\\n\\n\"I am sorry for you, Ainsley, if such is indeed a fact,\" declared\\nPhilip Ravenswood, gravely, \"for I do not think you could win the girl.\\nPlainly speaking, you are no match for either of them. You know that.\\nBut which one of them is it?\"\\n\\n\"The one with the <DW29> velvet dark eyes--with the face of a damask\\nrose--Ida May, I believe you called her.\"\\n\\nRavenswood looked wonderfully relieved. As long as it was not\\nHildegarde, he would not trouble himself.\\n\\n\"By George!\" exclaimed Ainsley, stopping short, \"I believe those three\\nyoung girls ride the bicycle. Now that I think of it, I\\'m sure I saw\\nthem whirl past the club yesterday morning. They wore natty navy blue\\nsuits and blue veils. I couldn\\'t see what their faces were like. Two\\nelderly gentlemen accompanied them.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, they ride the wheel,\" assented Ravenswood, reluctantly. \"The two\\ngentlemen were Mr. Ryder and Mr. Cramer, who are very enthusiastic over\\nthe sport. There\\'s a millionaire\\'s club of wheelmen here at Newport.\"\\n\\n\"I presume they will be at the fancy masquerade cycle tournament next\\nweek, then?\" said Ainsley, carelessly, though he listened anxiously for\\nthe reply.\\n\\n\"No doubt,\" returned Ravenswood. \"They were all at the last one. By the\\nway, it\\'s a very select affair. One has to be a member of the club, or\\nhave considerable outside influence, to secure tickets.\"\\n\\n\"Are you a member?\" asked Ainsley, quickly.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" returned Ravenswood. \"It was Hildegarde\\'s father who proposed my\\nname. I did not get even one black ball, and was consequently voted a\\nmember.\"\\n\\n\"Do you suppose, if you had been a poor devil of a clerk, instead of\\na millionaire\\'s son, you would have been voted in?\" asked Ainsley, a\\ntrifle bitterly, a hard light flashing into his eyes.\\n\\n\"Possibly not,\" replied Ravenswood, with a good-humored laugh.\\n\\n\"I should have thought you would have improved the opportunity of\\nseeing considerable of the Three Graces awheel,\" said Ainsley, after a\\nfew moments\\' pause.\\n\\n\"Their fathers discourage anything of that kind,\" laughed Philip; \"as\\nmore than one young man has found out.\"\\n\\n\"But Miss May\\'s relatives--do none of them ride?\"\\n\\n\"They are too old for that sort of thing,\" laughed Ravenswood. \"The old\\ngentleman is as deaf as a post, and is relegated to the hotel piazza\\nbecause of the gout. His wife is equally as deaf, and is too unwieldly\\nto venture far from her corner of the piazza. It is laughable to hear\\nthem shout at each other through their ear-trumpets. I have often\\nthought what a lonely life of it that beautiful young girl must have\\nwith those two old people. It would be unendurable, I fancy, if it were\\nnot for her two young friends.\"\\n\\n\"Probably they make up for not being companionable by not being so\\nstrict with their pretty prospective little heiress?\" suggested\\nAinsley, again listening eagerly for his friend\\'s reply.\\n\\n\"They certainly allow their granddaughter, or niece, whichever she is,\\nmore liberty than Hildegarde\\'s or Lily Ryder\\'s parents do. Still, I\\nsuppose they are confident that she can come to no harm, surrounded by\\nsuch careful friends and companions.\"\\n\\n\"Did you say, Philip, you were going to the fancy-dress masquerade\\ntournament?\" asked Royal Ainsley, slowly.\\n\\n\"I do not propose to miss it,\" responded Ravenswood.\\n\\n\"Do you think you can secure me a ticket, Phil?\" asked Ainsley,\\npoint-blank. \"Grant me that favor if you can. Remember, I ask it _as a\\ngreat favor_. Surely you can manage it somehow for me.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll try,\" replied Ravenswood. \"If it\\'s possible, you shall attend.\"\\n\\nDuring the next few days that followed, handsome Royal Ainsley saw as\\nmuch of the Three Graces as was possible. One day he was content with\\na bow or a smile--on the next, a few words in passing; but he was wise\\nenough to keep out of the way whenever their relatives were about.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III.\\n\\n\\nThe fancy-dress masquerade cycle carnival had been the talk of\\nfashionable circles in Newport for the last fortnight, and now, as the\\nauspicious evening drew near, excitement was almost at fever heat.\\n\\nThe tickets of admission had been closely guarded; gold could not buy\\nthem. The tickets, which were strictly _not transferable_, had been\\nduly delivered by messengers to the different members whose names they\\nbore, and the promoters of the affair felt duly satisfied that no one\\noutside the charmed circle of Newport\\'s fashionable Four Hundred could\\nby any possibility invade the sacred precincts.\\n\\nA whole army of officers were to guard against intruders. There was\\nto be a banquet in the supper-room at midnight, after the masks of\\nthe merry cyclers had been removed, that would be so startling in its\\nsumptuousness that the whole country would be talking about it, and\\nthose who had been fortunate enough to attend would never forget it in\\ntheir after lives.\\n\\nPhilip Ravenswood had indeed done his utmost to secure the admittance\\nof his friend; but even he had failed signally. The officers were\\ninexorable in their polite but firm refusal to his request.\\n\\nTwo hours later the grand masquerade cycle carnival was at its height.\\nThe marble walls of the millionaire club never held a more brilliant\\ngathering of ladies fair, with eyes behind silken masks brighter than\\nthe diamonds they wore, and men braver than the famous knights of old\\nin their powdered wigs, satin knee-breeches and spangled waistcoats.\\n\\nOne wheelman, in the costume of handsome Romeo, sprung from his wheel\\nnear one of the fountains, and watched with keen eyes through his mask\\nthe cyclers as they passed him one after another.\\n\\n\"Aha! I have them at last,\" he muttered, as he noted three wood-nymphs\\nhovering close together. \"Well, I declare, I thought I should have\\nlittle difficulty in distinguishing one from the other,\" he muttered;\\n\"but to save my life, I can not tell them apart. I shall trust to fate\\nto choose for me, hoping it will be the beauteous Hildegarde.\"\\n\\nSuddenly two plumed cavaliers sprung from their wheels before the two\\nforemost wood-nymphs, and asked permission in silent pantomime to ride\\nas their escorts around the rink, which request was graciously acceded\\nto, but with the dignity of young princesses.\\n\\n\"This is my opportunity,\" thought Romeo. \"I must claim the remaining\\nwood-nymph before some other fellow has the chance to capture her.\"\\n\\nThe next instant he was bowing low before her.\\n\\n\"May I have the great honor of riding as your escort around the rink,\\nfair wood-nymph?\" he whispered in a low, melodious voice. \"Ah, pardon\\nmy speaking; it was purely a slip of the tongue. I should have made\\nknown my request in pantomime. But pray forgive, and do not betray\\nme, fairest of all maidens, to the floor manager, pray, or I shall be\\nordered from the floor in deep disgrace.\"\\n\\n\"If she answers, I shall know by her voice which one of the three\\nheiresses she is,\" he thought.\\n\\n\"Oh, I shall not betray you, Mr. Ainsley,\" replied the girl, with a\\njolly little laugh, showing the whitest of pearly teeth, \"and I accept\\nyour escort to ride with me. I--I am so afraid of tumbling off my\\nwheel, this gay throng and the flashing lights bewilder me so. I--I was\\njust wondering if you would be here to-night.\"\\n\\n\"Fair maid, you know me?\" he whispered, in apparent amazement. \"I am\\nastounded, yet flattered. Pray be kind enough to exchange confidences.\\nI have been hoping against hope that _you_ are the one whom I longed to\\nsee here. Surely the throbbings of my heart tell me who you are, fair\\nnymph. Shall I breathe to you the name of her whom I ardently wish it\\nto be?\" he asked, softly.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" she answered, eagerly; and there was no mistaking the\\ncharacteristic catching of the breath, and the intense, eager gaze in\\nthe velvety eyes behind the silken mask.\\n\\nHe crushed the furtive hope that had stirred his heart for an instant\\nthat it might be Hildegarde, and answered, boldly:\\n\\n\"I prayed the fates to lead me to the feet of beauteous Ida May! Oh,\\ntell me--am I right? Do be kind, and tell me.\"\\n\\n\"Then the fates have answered your prayer,\" she replied. \"I suppose I\\nought _not_ to tell you until unmasking time, but really I can not help\\nit. I _am_ Ida May.\"\\n\\n\"Thanks, ten thousand thanks for ending my suspense, dear girl,\"\\nhe murmured, as only Royal Ainsley could utter the words. A few\\nsweeps around the rink, where handsome Romeo, with his superb fancy\\nriding, was the cynosure of all eager feminine eyes, midst murmurs\\nof admiration, then he whispered to his companion: \"Come into the\\nconservatory; the air is too close here. You are riding as though you\\nwere dizzy. Are you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" she answered. \"I _must_ have air. I----\"\\n\\nThe wheel suddenly wobbled recklessly from side to side, as though its\\nrider had lost control of it entirely.\\n\\nRoyal Ainsley sprung from his wheel just in time to prevent her from\\nfalling, and in that instant he crushed her closely to his heart, then\\nas quickly released her.\\n\\nThe excitement was so great, no one noticed this little by-play, or\\nsaw Romeo lead the fair wood-nymph from amid the glittering lights to\\nthe shadowy depths of the cool conservatory. Standing their wheels\\nagainst a marble Flora, he found a rustic bench on which he placed\\nher, taking a seat beside her, dangerously near, his hand closing over\\nthe fluttering little white one, his handsome head, with its fair,\\nclustering hair, bent near her own. A half hour they spent amid the\\ndim, cool shadows, the perfume of the roses enfolding them, the soft,\\nlow, bewildering echo of the delicious music floating out to them.\\n\\nRemember, the young girl was only seventeen, dear reader, otherwise the\\nplace, and the scene, and the fair, handsome lover by her side could\\nnot have infatuated her so quickly or so deeply.\\n\\n\"This is heaven!\" he whispered. \"How I wish we could linger here\\nforever, Ida--I your devoted knight, and you my queen, the world\\nforgetting, by the world forgot! Do _you_ wish it could be so?\"\\n\\nThe low cadence of his voice; the thrilling touch of that strong, white\\nhand that was stealing around the supple waist, drawing her toward\\nhim; the panting of his breath, which she could feel on her flushed\\ncheek; the mesmeric, steady gaze of those bright blue, shining eyes,\\nbewildered her--made her heart flutter as it had never fluttered\\nbefore.\\n\\n\"Do you wish we could be always together, Ida?\" he persisted.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" answered the girl, with a half sob of affright, trembling under\\nthe strange spell that had slowly but surely been cast over her.\\n\\n\"Then marry me, Ida!\" he cried, \"this very night--within the hour, and\\nno one can ever part us after that! Oh, Ida, do not refuse me!\" he\\nurged. \"I love you so that I would die for you. Fate surely intended us\\nfor each other, or we would never have met and loved as we do. Oh, my\\ndarling, you can not deny it! You do love me, Ida May?\"\\n\\nShe strove with all her might to deny it; but, in spite of herself,\\nhe wrung the truth from her lips--that she _did_ love him. A sudden\\nlight that she could not quite understand leaped up into his eyes for a\\nmoment, and a triumphant smile curved his lips.\\n\\n\"We shall be married to-night, Ida!\" he cried. \"I will arrange it\\nsomehow;\" and as he uttered the words, he told himself that the great\\nheiress was as good as won.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV.\\n\\n\\nThe crash of the music, the hum of voices, and the song of the rippling\\nfountains seemed to dazzle Ida May\\'s senses.\\n\\n\"Promise me that you will marry me, my darling!\" cried the impetuous\\nlover. \"Would it be so very difficult, Ida?\" he whispered.\\n\\nShe clung to him, the terror deepening in her eyes.\\n\\n\"This is a little romance all our own,\" he added, clasping her\\nclosely. \"Ida, let me kiss you!\" He clasped his arms around her and\\ndrew her to his breast. \"You are mine in life, mine in death, and mine\\nthrough all eternity!\"\\n\\nHe kissed the sweet lips over and over again.\\n\\nShe was so young that she believed him.\\n\\n\"Let us be married first, then we can talk over all these things\\nafter!\" he exclaimed, impetuously.\\n\\nShe was dazed by his passionate words.\\n\\nHe felt quite sure that this sweet, beautiful, dainty young girl could\\nnot hold out against him if he only persisted.\\n\\nOne more bold stroke, and the heiress would be his.\\n\\nThere would be a scene, he well knew, when he brought the young girl\\nback to the old folks. But it would surely end by their forgiving her.\\nThey could not hold out against her very long.\\n\\n\"You are--sure--it--it--would be right, Mr. Ainsley?\" she faltered.\\n\\n\"You must not call me \\'mister\\' sweet one,\" he cried. \"To you I shall\\nbe \\'Royal\\' from now on to eternity. Let me manage this affair, my\\ndarling,\" he added.\\n\\nAll power of resistance seemed swallowed up by his indomitable will.\\n\\n\"Go to the cloak-room, my love,\" he whispered, \"and change your attire\\nas quickly as you can. I will meet you at the fountain nearest the\\nentrance. Not one word to either of your friends, Ida,\" he said,\\nwarningly. \"Promise me that!\"\\n\\nThere was no crossing him. Indeed, the very power to even think for\\nherself seemed to have left her.\\n\\nLike one in a dream, Ida May donned her street clothes, the thought\\nfilling her mind of what Hildegarde and Lily would say when it was\\nunmasking time and they came to look for her. How startled they would\\nbe!\\n\\nOutside all was confusion. There was a great crush of carriages, the\\nbabble of coachmen and footmen, the crunching of wheels, and the\\ncalling of numbers. To the girl whom Royal Ainsley led on to so strange\\na fate it seemed like a dream. Some one followed with their wheels.\\nRoyal Ainsley took them from the man, and she saw him toss him several\\npieces of silver.\\n\\nHe did not tell her that he had written a note to an old minister,\\nliving two miles out of the village, asking him to remain at home to\\nmarry them. No name had been signed to the note; but he had argued to\\nhimself that the minister, who probably was sadly in need of making an\\nextra dollar, would stay at home to perform the ceremony. If his plans\\nmatured well, all well and good; if they miscarried, well, no one would\\nbe the wiser as to who sent the letter.\\n\\nHe assisted her to mount her wheel, and, as if in a dream, they went\\nspeeding down the boulevard.\\n\\n\"We must make quicker time, my darling,\" he said.\\n\\nWas it a sob he heard coming from the girl\\'s lips? Ida May seemed to\\nhave suddenly awakened to a sense of what she had done. A brief half\\nhour since she had been in the midst of a brilliant party, and now,\\nscarcely knowing how it had come about, she found herself flying with\\nthe handsome lover, whom she had known but a few short weeks, going she\\nknew not whither.\\n\\nThe awakening came to her like a terrible shock.\\n\\n\"Royal!\" she cried, \"oh, Royal, what have we done? Where are we going?\\nI did not mean to run away. I must have been mad. Let us go back\\nagain!\"\\n\\nAs she spoke, the great clock from some adjoining tower struck the hour\\nof twelve.\\n\\n\"We are too late,\" he said. \"We have burned our bridges behind us. They\\nare unmasking now, and they have missed you. They will soon institute a\\nsearch.\"\\n\\nShe clasped his arm.\\n\\n\"Oh, Royal! I must tell you all!\"\\n\\nThe hot, trembling hand clung to him, the lovely young face was full of\\nawful grief.\\n\\n\"My own darling!\" he cried, leaning over and rapturously embracing her,\\nthough in doing so he nearly caused her to fall from her wheel.\\n\\nSuddenly the heavens overhead seemed to darken, the wind to freshen,\\nand the booming of the waves, as they dashed heavily against the shore,\\nsounded dismally in the distance.\\n\\n\"We must make haste,\" said Royal Ainsley; \"there is a storm coming up.\\nI think we could save nearly half a mile by cutting across this field.\"\\n\\nHe swung open a gate opening out into a broad patch of land, and Ida\\nrode in.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V.\\n\\n\\n\"I see a light glimmering in a window a short distance away. I will\\ntake you there, and walk back to the village to get some kind of a\\nconveyance.\"\\n\\nIn a few moments they found themselves knocking for admission at the\\nlittle cottage from whence they had observed the light.\\n\\nHis impatient knock brought a white, terrified face to a window which\\nwas opened above.\\n\\n\"What do you want?\" asked a voice in unmistakable tones of fear.\\n\\n\"I must have shelter for this young lady for a little while,\" exclaimed\\nAinsley, impatiently; adding: \"I will pay you handsomely if you will\\nallow her to remain here an hour or two, until I can go for a carriage\\nfor her.\"\\n\\nThe window was closed quickly down again, and Royal heard some one say\\nquite distinctly:\\n\\n\"I tell you it is only a _ruse_. It is an officer of the law.\"\\n\\nAgain Royal knocked impatiently.\\n\\n\"It is commencing to rain,\" he called. \"For Heaven\\'s sake, open the\\ndoor quickly!\"\\n\\nDespite the sobs and protestations of the voice inside, a man opened\\nthe door and stepped out, confronting them. One hand held a lighted\\nlamp and the other rested upon his hip pocket.\\n\\nTo Royal Ainsley\\'s intense astonishment, he found that he was at the\\nsummer cottage of Newport\\'s haughty mayor.\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon,\" stammered the man, in dire confusion.\\n\\n\"It is rather late to awaken any one; but you have heard the words,\\n\\'any port in a storm\\'? The truth is, I want to find shelter for this\\nyoung lady until I can go for a conveyance to take her to a minister\\nwho is awaiting us to perform the marriage ceremony.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, that is it!\" exclaimed the mayor, with a look of relief coming\\nover his face. \"An elopement, eh?\"\\n\\n\"All is fair in love, you know,\" laughed the young man, leading Ida\\ninto the parlor, his host preceding them.\\n\\n\"Who are you, and who is the young lady?\" inquired the man.\\n\\nIt was Royal\\'s turn to hesitate now. If he found out that the young\\ngirl clinging to his arm was the heiress of the Mays, would he not\\nrefuse to perform the ceremony until they could be communicated with?\\n\\n\"I am Royal Ainsley,\" answered the young man, affecting not to hear the\\nlast part of the question; and Ida, thinking she was called upon to\\nspeak, responded, promptly:\\n\\n\"And I am Ida May, sir.\"\\n\\nThe mayor wheeled about quickly.\\n\\n\"What! Did I hear you say the name May? Are you the young girl stopping\\nat the Ocean House whom they call the niece of the Mays?\"\\n\\nThe girl was trembling so she could not answer.\\n\\n\"We might as well put a bold front on the matter,\" whispered Royal,\\nclasping quickly the ice-cold hands.\\n\\n\"She is, sir,\" he answered, with an air of assurance which he was far\\nfrom feeling.\\n\\nThe effect of his words upon his host was wonderful. An expression that\\nwas almost diabolical flashed over his face.\\n\\n\"Hold!\" he cried. \"You need look no further for a minister; I will\\nperform the ceremony. It is a pity for the young lady to have to go out\\nin the storm to have a little service like that rendered. Old May\\'s\\nniece!\" he muttered under his breath. \"Ah, what a glorious revenge it\\nis for me to give her to this profligate! Of course, old May don\\'t know\\nanything about the escapade of this girl!\"\\n\\nHe clinched his hands tightly together as he looked at her. There was\\nno feature of old John May perceptible in this slender little creature;\\nbut for all that, he hated her--ay, he hated her with a deadly hatred.\\n_He knew why._\\n\\n\"I will help you in this affair,\" he said, with a peculiar laugh that\\nmight mean much or might mean little.\\n\\nThe ceremony was not a long one, and almost before Ida could realize\\nwhat was taking place, Royal Ainsley was bending over her, and calling\\nher his dear little wife. But there was something about the kiss that\\nhe laid on her lips that made a strange shiver creep over her.\\n\\nRoyal Ainsley could hardly conceal his triumph. No matter if the Mays\\ndid find her now, they could not undo what had been done. He had wedded\\nher and her millions!\\n\\n\"Is there a train that leaves for New York?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"Yes; one passes here in about twenty minutes from now. By cutting\\nacross over to that side road you could easily catch it.\"\\n\\nHalf an hour later, they were steaming toward the city as fast as steam\\ncould carry them. The dark curly head nestled against his shoulder,\\nwhile Royal looked out of the window, out into the blackness of the\\nnight, little dreaming that he was on the eve of a terrible tragedy.\\n\\nHe had been lucky enough to secure the little compartment at the rear\\nof the drawing-room car, which those who have money enough to pay for\\ncan secure exclusively for themselves.\\n\\n\"I ought to tell you something that is weighing very heavily upon my\\nmind, Royal,\" she said, nestling closer to her fair, handsome, boyish\\nhusband.\\n\\n\"Not until to-morrow, love,\" he declared, drawing her toward him, and\\nkissing her fondly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI.\\n\\n\\nIt was early the next morning when the Newport express steamed into the\\nGrand Central Depot.\\n\\nRoyal Ainsley cast a furtive glance around him as he stepped upon the\\nplatform. He had quite expected a dozen or more detectives to spring\\nforward, for, of course, the telegraph wires had been busy during the\\nnight.\\n\\nThey would no doubt be waiting to arrest him for abducting the heiress.\\nBut when he had blandly informed them that lovely Ida May was his wife,\\nwhat could they do but fall back abashed and disconcerted.\\n\\nTo his great surprise, he seemed to create no sensation whatever. No\\none even noticed him as he joined the throng, with Ida May clinging\\ntightly to his arm.\\n\\n\"I will give them some little trouble to find us,\" he thought to\\nhimself.\\n\\nHe knew of a quiet, aristocratic family hotel facing the park, and\\nplacing Ida in a carriage, he took a seat beside her, and directed the\\ndriver to proceed as quickly as possible to the place indicated.\\n\\nWhirling through the streets of gay New York was quite a sensation to\\nIda, who had never been outside of her own country village, save for\\nthat fateful trip to Newport.\\n\\nWith Royal clasping her two little fluttering hands in one of his\\nstrong white ones, his left arm holding her close as the cab rattled\\nup Broadway, her fear of the noise, the great rush of people hurrying\\nhither and thither, and the great crush of vehicles that threatened to\\ndemolish them every moment, gradually subsided as they rode along.\\n\\nThey reached their destination, and a moment more were ushered into the\\nlittle white-and-gold parlor.\\n\\n\"We will have the best breakfast that they can prepare,\" said Royal,\\n\"and then I shall take you to see the sights of the city.\"\\n\\nHe was obliged to take the hotel clerk into his confidence.\\n\\n\"It\\'s an elopement,\" he whispered in the clerk\\'s ear. \"My bride is the\\nheiress of the wealthy Mays, of Boston. There may be a deuce of a row\\nwhen they trace us to this place, but it will end all right by the\\nfatted calf being killed for us. But as for the breakfast, how long\\nwill it take to prepare it?\"\\n\\n\"Not more than fifteen minutes,\" returned the clerk, with an obsequious\\nbow. \"We will send up to the parlor, and let you know when it is\\nready,\" he added.\\n\\nHe turned away with a royal air. Already he felt as if the May millions\\nwere in his pocket, that he was a man to be envied, that he was of\\ngreat importance.\\n\\nRoyal Ainsley immediately joined Ida in the parlor. He found her\\nensconced in one of the large velvet easy-chairs, looking out of the\\nwindow, with something very like fright in her great dark eyes.\\n\\n\"Oh, Royal, are you sure it is quite right?\" she sobbed. \"Did you want\\nme to marry you so very much?\"\\n\\n\"What a silly little girl you are!\" he cried, impetuously. \"Of course,\\nI want you. I could not live without you. I know you must be very\\nhungry, as well as tired from loss of sleep. Come over to this sofa and\\nsit down, and we will talk over our plans.\"\\n\\n\"Royal,\" she whispered, clasping his hands closer, \"you would not\\nlisten to me when I tried to tell you something in the conservatory;\\nbut you must listen to me now. I can not be quite happy, dear, until\\nyou know all. I--I have a confession to make.\"\\n\\nHe looked at her blankly.\\n\\n\"What odd words you use, my darling Ida!\" he said. \"A confession! I do\\nnot like to hear you use such an expression. I hope that there is no\\nother lover in the background?\"\\n\\n\"It is not a lover!\" she cried, clinging to him. \"I have never loved\\nany one else but you!\"\\n\\n\"Then it is all right, my angel!\" he cried, brightly, gathering her\\nclosely to him, despite the fact that people were passing in the\\ncorridor outside, and had a full view of all that was taking place\\nwithin the room. She struggled out of his arms, blushing like a peony,\\neven though she was his bride.\\n\\n\"Sit opposite me, where I can see you, and it will not be so hard to\\ntell you _all_,\" sobbed Ida, faintly.\\n\\nHe complied with her wishes.\\n\\n\"Cut the story as short as possible, dear,\" he said, \"or you will be\\nobliged to have it continued in our next, as breakfast will soon be\\nready.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, how shall I tell you the truth, Royal!\" she said, distressedly.\\n\"Perhaps you won\\'t smile so when you know all, and--and--you might even\\nhate me.\"\\n\\n\"No matter what the little story is that you have to tell me, my\\ndarling, I will love you better than ever.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Royal, are you sure of it?\" she cried, with that frightened look\\nwhich puzzled him so.\\n\\n\"Yes; I give you my word beforehand, that, no matter what you have to\\ntell me, I will love you all the more!\"\\n\\n\"I will tell you all, then, and throw myself on your mercy to forgive\\nme for the past,\" she sobbed. \"Hold my hands, Royal, closely in your\\nown, while I tell you all of the pitiful past, from beginning to end;\\nand then, Royal, you shall kiss my tears away, even--oh, Heaven, pity\\nme!--though I have sinned beyond pardon!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII.\\n\\n\\nLittle dreaming of the purport of the story Ida had to tell, Royal\\nAinsley drew near. For a moment, Ida May\\'s great somber eyes looked\\ninto his as though she would read his very soul.\\n\\n\"Tell me over again that you will forgive me, no matter what it is that\\nI have to tell you.\"\\n\\n\"I have already given you that promise over and over again,\" he\\ndeclared. \"Surely you don\\'t want me to take an oath to that effect?\"\\n\\n\"Not if your solemn promise is strong enough to bind you.\"\\n\\n\"You forget that you are wasting time, Ida?\" he said, good-humoredly.\\n\\n\"It will not take me long to tell my sad little story,\" she answered,\\nwith a half sob; \"and oh, what a world of comfort it will be for me to\\nknow that you will care for me, no matter what the world may think.\\nWhen you hear my story you will understand the great temptation, and\\nwill not judge me too cruelly.\\n\\n\"To begin with, my mother and I lived with a very wealthy family in\\nDorchester. My mother was housekeeper, and I--well, I had no regular\\nposition there, until, owing to the meager salary they paid my mother,\\nI was compelled to learn telegraphy, and found a position at the\\nstation. To gain my mother\\'s consent to do this was extremely hard.\\n\\n\"\\'They will not be pleased, Ida,\\' she said, piteously.\\n\\n\"\\'What do the Deerings care for you or me?\\' I answered, bitterly. \\'Only\\nto make you toil year in and year out for a pittance so meager that it\\nscarcely keeps body and soul together!\\'\\n\\n\"\\'But they allow me to keep you with me, my dear child. That is\\neverything to a mother who is poor,\\' she sighed.\\n\\n\"\\'I am not a child any longer,\\' I cried. \\'I am quite sixteen. I must be\\nmaking money now, if ever, to help you!\\'\\n\\n\"\\'But what can you do?\\' she asked.\\n\\n\"When I told her my plans, she looked at me dubiously.\\n\\n\"\\'Surely Mrs. Deering would not object,\\' I declared.\\n\\n\"But she did object. To my surprise she flew into a terrible rage when\\nI summoned courage enough to go to the morning-room the next day and\\nasked to speak to her.\\n\\n\"I unfolded to the cold, proud woman my plans to make a living. She did\\nnot wait to hear me through, but flew into such a passion of rage that\\nI drew back in terror.\\n\\n\"\\'I have different plans for you entirely, Ida May,\\' she said. \\'Go to\\nyour mother. I told her my plans scarcely half an hour ago. She will\\nunfold them to you. Mind, they must be carried out by you, or your\\nmother and you will suffer. Your father owed us a sum of money before\\nhe died, and during the past years your mother has worked to pay us\\noff. Over one-half yet remains to be paid. Your mother\\'s name is signed\\nto your father\\'s notes of indebtedness, and she is responsible for\\nthem. If I pressed for payment and she could not pay, she could be\\nthrown into a debtor\\'s prison.\\'\\n\\n\"I sobbed aloud in my terror: \\'Oh, Mrs. Deering, if this indeed be\\ntrue, there is more need than ever for me to earn money to pay off my\\nmother\\'s debts.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'There is another way in which you can pay them off,\\' she answered.\\n\\n\"\\'Oh, how?\\' I cried, falling on my knees and clasping my hands.\\n\\n\"The answer came like a crash of thunder from a clear sky.\\n\\n\"\\'By marrying my nephew,\\' she said, harshly.\\n\\n\"I sprung to my feet in terror. Marry any one! I, who was only a child!\\n\\n\"\\'My mother would not consent to anything like that, even----\\'\\n\\n\"\\'She will be forced to consent!\\' was the harsh reply. \\'My nephew will\\nbe here in a week.\\'\\n\\n\"I found my mother walking her room, wringing her hands and tearing her\\nhair. Her excitement was so great that for a moment I was terrified.\\n\\n\"\\'Has she told you all, Ida?\\' she asked, in terror.\\n\\n\"\\'Yes, mother,\\' I answered.\\n\\n\"\\'And did she tell you what this nephew of hers was like?\\'\\n\\n\"\\'No,\\' I replied, greatly puzzled by her manner.\\n\\n\"She shuddered as with a terrible chill.\\n\\n\"\\'Listen, Ida,\\' she said, in a strained, awful voice: \\'Her nephew is\\nsuch a horrid creature, that to be hated he needs but to be seen. He is\\na hunchback--and--an idiot--has a touch of insanity about him. Except\\nthe first few years of his life, he has been confined in an asylum.\\nThis nephew has a bachelor uncle, who has declared his intention\\nto make the young man his heir if he marries when he is twenty-one.\\nOtherwise the great fortune goes to another branch of the family. They\\nwould make a victim of you, wreck your beautiful young life for their\\nown ambitious aims. It will be six months before he is of age. But the\\nmarriage shall never be, my darling. Your young life shall never be\\nsacrificed by these inhuman Shylocks. When the hour comes, we will die\\ntogether.\\'\\n\\n\"One day my mother met me with a white, awful face.\\n\\n\"\\'Mrs. Deering\\'s nephew has arrived with a valet!\\' she cried, under her\\nbreath.\\n\\n\"\\'But the six months are not up, mother,\" I cried. \\'It wants a\\nfortnight to that time.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'He has come to stay until you make your decision.\\'\\n\\n\"Oh, God! the horror of it! Death a thousand times over would have been\\npreferable to that.\\n\\n\"How could I stand at the altar and promise to obey a creature the very\\nsight of whom filled me with disgust and terror?\\n\\n\"I fled through the village, not daring to look behind me, and never\\nstopping until I reached the telegraph office.\\n\\n\"It was little wonder that I made strange mistakes during the hour that\\nfollowed.\\n\\n\"It was during this time that Mrs. May stepped up to the window and\\ncalled for a blank.\\n\\n\"Although her name was the same as mine, yet we were in no way related\\nto each other. They were wealthy people from Boston, I had heard, and\\nwere summering in the village.\\n\\n\"Without waiting to see the message sent, the lady hurried out of the\\noffice. A great sigh broke from my lips as I noted the well-filled\\npurse that she carried, the magnificent diamonds she wore on her hands,\\nand which swung sparkling from her ears. Any one of the gems she wore\\nwould have been a fortune to a poor girl like me.\\n\\n\"As she crossed the railway track in the direction of the post office,\\nshe must have seen the train bearing down upon her from around the\\ncurve of the road.\\n\\n\"However, she fainted away from fright, and lay directly on the track.\\nI had seen it all from my window, and I sprung to her rescue and\\ndragged her by main force from the track just in time to save her from\\ndestruction, as the ponderous locomotive just then thundered by. Mrs.\\nMay\\'s gratitude was great when she recovered consciousness.\\n\\n\"\\'How shall I ever reward you, my good girl?\\' she cried.\\n\\n\"\\'I need no reward,\\' I answered. \\'I would have done that for any one!\\'\\n\\n\"\\'You must be rewarded,\\' she declared. \\'My husband is coming from\\nBoston to-night, and he will insist upon doing handsomely by you.\\'\\n\\n\"I was living at home with my poor old mother, and when I went home\\nthat evening and told her the story, she wept like a child.\\n\\n\"\\'You did a noble action, Ida,\\' she said; adding slowly: \\'The Mays\\nare very rich. I should not be surprised if they made you a handsome\\npresent. I once knew a gentleman who gave a lad twenty-five dollars for\\nsaving his son from drowning. Perhaps they may do as well by you.\\'\\n\\n\"You see, we were very poor--mother and I--and twenty-five dollars\\nseemed a great deal to us.\\n\\n\"\\'How much good we could do with that sum,\\' my mother said. \\'We could\\nget a little ahead in our rent, and spare enough out of it to get a new\\ndress for you.\\'\\n\\n\"I clasped my hands. A new dress! Oh, surely it would be madness to\\nhope for such a thing!\\n\\n\"That evening Mrs. May sent for me to come to the grand cottage where\\nshe was stopping. Her husband, a very deaf old gentleman, sat at\\nthe window as I entered. They both thanked me in the most eager and\\ngrateful fashion.\\n\\n\"\\'We have been thinking the matter over,\\' said Mrs. May, \\'and I have\\ncome to the conclusion that I will do something handsome for you--give\\nyou a pleasure such as you have never experienced in your young life.\\'\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII.\\n\\n\\n\"Mrs. May paused and looked smilingly at me for a moment or two.\\n\\n\"\\'So great is the treat I have in store for you that you will never\\nforget it. But Mr. May and I disagree slightly as to what it shall be.\\nWe now lay the proposition before you. Which would you prefer--have\\nfive hundred dollars in cash, or be taken to Newport for a season, have\\nlovely dresses, and stop at a great hotel, under _my_ protection, and\\nhave as fine a time as any young girl at the sea-shore?\\'\\n\\n\"I cried aloud in the exuberance of my joy. I had read of the lives of\\nother young girls at the sea-shore, and this opportunity seemed like\\nthe opening out of fairy-land to me. You will not blame me, Royal;\\nI was young and romantic. I had never seen anything of life or its\\npleasures. A season at Newport! The very thought of it fairly took away\\nmy breath.\\n\\n\"\\'Oh, I will go to Newport!\\' I cried. \\'Then the great dream of my life\\nwill be realized!\\'\\n\\n\"\\'My husband thought you would prefer the money, but I knew that you\\nwould prefer the pleasure.\\'\\n\\n\"Half wild with joy, I went home and told my mother the wonderful news.\\nShe shook her head sadly.\\n\\n\"\\'We are so poor, you should have chosen the money, Ida,\\' she sobbed.\\n\\'Such a great gift is offered you but once in a life-time!\\'\\n\\n\"\\'But what does Mrs. May want you to do for her, Ida? Are you to be her\\nmaid?\\'\\n\\n\"\\'Oh, no, mother!\\' I cried, with a hysterical laugh. \\'I am to be a\\nreal lady, wear fine clothes, and sit on the porch reading novels, or\\npromenade on the sea-shore, from the time I get up in the morning till\\nI retire at night. I shall have pin-money, too, they say, and that I\\nwill send home to you. So everything will go on with you while I am\\naway as it did while I was here.\\'\\n\\n\"We had never been parted from each other, mother and I, and oh! it\\nwrung her heart to say \\'Yes.\\'\\n\\n\"But after much pleading on my part she consented to let me go. She\\nmade one proviso, however, and that was--I was not to fall in love with\\nany one whom I might meet.\\n\\n\"Oh, I can not tell you of my delight when I saw the wonderful dresses\\nthat Mrs. May purchased for me, saying that they were all my own\\nforever after. She took me to Newport with her. As my name was the same\\nas theirs, every one took it for granted that I was a niece of theirs,\\ninstead of their _protegee_ for a few short weeks, a report which the\\nMays did not trouble themselves to contradict.\"\\n\\nShe had told her story hastily, impetuously, not daring to look into\\nher lover\\'s face until she had concluded. Then she raised her great\\ndark eyes slowly. But what she saw in her husband\\'s face made her cry\\nout in terror.\\n\\n\"Oh, Royal! Royal! what is the matter?\" she cried, in alarm.\\n\\nHe sat before her as though he were petrified. The glassy, horrified\\nstare in his eyes cut to her heart like the thrust of a sword.\\n\\n\"I married you for love. You have helped me to escape Mrs. Deering\\'s\\ndreaded nephew,\" she faltered.\\n\\nBy a wonderful effort he found his voice.\\n\\n\"Not the heiress of the Mays!\" he cried, hoarsely, as though he was\\nunable to realize the truth.\\n\\n\"You do not love me the less for what I have done, do you?\" she cried,\\ncatching her breath with a sharp sob.\\n\\nBefore he could find words to answer, breakfast was announced.\\n\\n\"Go in and eat your breakfast, Ida,\" he said. \"I have some important\\nmatters which I must attend to that will keep me busy for the next hour\\nto come. Don\\'t wait for me. Lie down and rest until you hear from me.\\nYou will need all your strength to meet that which is before you.\" And\\nhis brows darkened ominously.\\n\\nShe was young, and youth has an appetite all its own. She was very\\ntired with all she had gone through the last few hours, and the\\nappetizing breakfast spread before her caused her to forget everything\\nelse.\\n\\nLike all young, healthy girls, she ate heartily; then she rose from the\\ntable and re-entered the little parlor to wait for the coming of Royal\\nto ask him to send a telegram to her mother.\\n\\n\"Shall I show you to your room, miss?\" asked the waiter.\\n\\n\"No,\" she answered. \"I will wait here.\"\\n\\n\"Then here is a letter which has just been handed me to give to you.\"\\n\\nShe opened it, and found that it was from Royal.\\n\\nFor one moment Ida May looked with an expression of puzzled wonder at\\nthe letter which the hotel waiter had handed her.\\n\\nIt was in Royal\\'s handwriting; she saw that at once.\\n\\nWhat could he write to her about, when he had been away from her\\nscarcely an hour? He probably wished to remind her to be sure to be\\nready when he arrived.\\n\\n\"How he loves me!\" she murmured, a pink flush stealing into the dimpled\\ncheeks. \"What a happy girl I ought to be that my lover loves me so\\nwell!\"\\n\\nThe waiter had gone back to attend to his duty. She saw that she was\\nalone, and with a quick action she raised the envelope to her lips with\\nher little white hands and kissed it--ay, kissed passionately the sword\\nwhich was to slay her the next moment.\\n\\nSeating herself in a cozy arm-chair close by the open window, Ida\\nMay opened the letter which was to be her death-warrant, and read as\\nfollows:\\n\\n \"IDA, I suppose the contents of this note will give you something of\\n a shock; but it is best to know the truth now than later on. I shall\\n come to the point at once, that you may not be kept in suspense.\\n\\n \"The truth is, Ida, that your confession has knocked all our little\\n plans on the head. To write plainly, when I thoughtlessly married\\n you, it was under the impression that you were the niece of the\\n Mays--their future heiress. I have not told you much about myself in\\n the past, but I am obliged to do so now.\\n\\n \"I am not at all a rich fellow. I am working along as best I can,\\n living on what people call wits--and expectations, which make me a\\n veritable slave to the whims of a capricious old aunt and uncle.\\n\\n \"They have decided that I must marry a girl who has money. I would\\n not dare to present a portionless bride to them. In such a case, all\\n my future prospects would be ruined. I must add that I have a still\\n greater surprise for you. On leaving you, I purchased this morning\\'s\\n paper, and the first item that met my eye was the absconding of the\\n man who performed the ceremony for us last night. It appears that he\\n was turned out of office some two days before, impeached, as it were,\\n for embezzling money.\\n\\n \"All power was taken from him to act in the capacity of mayor. Thus\\n the ceremony which we thought made us one is not binding. You are free\\n as air. No one will be any the wiser, and you are none the worse for\\n our little escapade--romance--call it what you will.\\n\\n \"A little affair in the life of a telegraph operator will not set the\\n heart of the great world throbbing with excitement. I am sorry affairs\\n have turned out this way; for, upon my word, I could have liked you.\\n There is but one thing to do under the circumstances; that is, to part\\n company. I advise you to go quietly back and marry the rich lover Mrs.\\n Deering has selected for you. That will be better than drudging your\\n life away in a telegraph office.\\n\\n \"This is all I have to say, and thus I take French leave of you.\\n Forget me as quickly as you can, little girl. I am nearly dead broke,\\n but I am generous enough to share what money I have with you. Inclosed\\n you will find a twenty-dollar bill--quite enough to take you back to\\n the village which you should never have left. Yours in great haste,\\n\\n     \"\\'ROYAL.\\'\"\\n\\nOnce, twice, thrice--ay, a dozen times--the girl read the heartless\\nletter through until every word was scorched into her brain in letters\\nof fire, then it fluttered from her hands to the floor.\\n\\nShe sat quite still, like one petrified by a sudden awful horror; then\\ncreeping to the window, she raised the sash, and, looking up into God\\'s\\nface through the glinting sunshine, asked the angels in Heaven to\\ntell her if it was true that the husband she had but just wedded had\\ndeserted her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX.\\n\\n\\nAgain the poor child picked up the cruel letter; but she could not read\\na line of it, though she sat looking at the written page.\\n\\n\"Not his wife!\" she moaned over and over again, clutching her little\\nhands over her heart.\\n\\nWith a sudden frenzy she tore the letter into a thousand shreds, and\\nflung the pieces from her through the open window.\\n\\nWould her poor, sick mother\\'s heart break when she told her all? When\\nshe went home, would they force her to marry the terrible being she\\nabhorred?\\n\\nHome! Ah, God! what a mockery! She had only a shelter. If she refused\\nto marry the horrible hunchback, her mother and herself would not even\\nhave that.\\n\\nHow could she face the future? The very thought of it made the blood\\nchill in her veins.\\n\\n\"Oh, Royal! Royal! death from your hands would have been easier than\\nthat!\" she moaned.\\n\\nThe next moment there was a heavy fall, and one of the house-maids,\\npassing the parlor, saw the girl lying in a heap.\\n\\nThey did all in their power to restore her to consciousness; but it\\nwas quite useless. When they had worked an hour over her, they became\\nalarmed.\\n\\nWhere was her husband? Why did he not return? The hotel physician did\\nall in his power, but without avail.\\n\\n\"It looks like a case of brain fever,\" he said, \"or perhaps typhoid.\\nEither is contagious, therefore dangerous. I should advise that she be\\nsent to the hospital around the corner.\"\\n\\n\"That husband of hers has not settled his bill!\" exclaimed the\\nproprietor, his face darkening angrily.\\n\\n\"It is _my_ opinion,\" said the doctor, \"that it is best not to await\\nthe return of the young gentleman who accompanied her here. In short,\\nit is my opinion that he has deserted her.\"\\n\\nIn less time than it takes to tell it, poor, hapless Ida May, the\\nvictim of such a cruel misfortune, and a sadder fate yet to follow, was\\ntaken to the hospital. The waning summer days drifted slowly by, and\\nautumn came with its dead, rustling leaves and sobbing winds, before\\nIda May opened her eyes to consciousness and turned them full upon the\\nwhite-capped nurse bending over her.\\n\\n\"Where is Royal?\" she asked, faintly.\\n\\n\"You mean the young man who left you at the hotel?\" queried the nurse,\\nwho had heard the young girl\\'s sad story; adding: \"He never came back\\nto inquire for you. He has deserted you. He did not care whether or not\\nthe shock would kill you. If there was ever a heartless scoundrel on\\nthe face of the earth, he is that one!\"\\n\\nThe lovely white young face never changed its pallor, the dark eyes\\nnever left the grim countenance of the nurse.\\n\\n\"I want to leave this place at once,\" said the girl, attempting to rise\\nfrom her cot.\\n\\n\"No, no; you must not do so!\" exclaimed the nurse. \"It would be\\ndangerous in your case.\"\\n\\n\"But I want my mother,\" moaned Ida, piteously.\\n\\nWhen the nurse made her rounds an hour later, to her great\\nconsternation she found that Cot 27 was empty. The girl had flown! The\\nmost diligent search through the city failed to elicit the slightest\\ntrace of her whereabouts.\\n\\nAn hour later a little dark figure, ensconced in a corner of the car,\\nwas whirling rapidly toward Dorchester.\\n\\nShe sat staring from the window with eyes that did not see so intent\\nwas she with her own thoughts.\\n\\n\"I can not marry Mrs. Deering\\'s nephew,\" she sobbed, under her breath.\\n\"It would be easier for me to die. But what shall I do to raise the\\nmoney for which they hold my poor mother a veritable slave!\"\\n\\nShe clasped her hands in piteous entreaty; but the soft, radiant moon\\nand the golden stars to which she raised her eyes so appealingly could\\nfind no answer for her.\\n\\nAs the train slowed up at the station, she pulled her veil down\\nclosely. She hurriedly alighted and sped like a storm-driven swallow\\nup the village street and along the high-road, until, almost out of\\nbreath, she reached the Deerings\\' mansion. She stood transfixed for a\\nmoment at the gate.\\n\\nWhat was there about the place that caused such a shudder to creep over\\nher? What did the awful presentiment, as of coming evil, mean that took\\npossession of her body and soul?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X.\\n\\n\\nHow weird the place looked, how gaunt and bare the great oak-trees\\nlooked, looming up darkly against the moonlit sky! The dead leaves\\nrustled across her path as she crept around to the rear door.\\n\\nShe looked up at her mother\\'s window, and another great chill crept\\nover her. All was dark there. It had always been her mother\\'s custom\\nto place her lamp on the broad window-sill at night. Many a time it\\nhad been her beacon-light in cutting across lots from the station on\\nevenings when she had been detained by her work. How strange it was\\nthat the light was not in the window to-night!\\n\\n\"Mother is not expecting me to-night,\" she said to herself, \"that is\\nthe reason it is not there.\"\\n\\nBut ah, how she missed it! How her heart had yearned to behold it, with\\na yearning so great that it had been the most intense pain. She lifted\\nthe latch and entered tremblingly, hesitatingly. It had been over two\\nmonths since her mother had heard from her. How had her patient,\\nsuffering mother lived through it?\\n\\nAs she crossed the hall she heard the sound of Mrs. Deering\\'s voice in\\na sharp, high key. Perhaps the horrible nephew was with her. She paused\\nin a paroxysm of terror. She was talking to her husband, scolding him,\\nrather.\\n\\n\"It isn\\'t _my_ fault that we lost the fortune,\" he was answering her\\nmeekly. \"You brought your nephew out of the asylum too soon. You knew\\nhe would not be here a fortnight before he would do some terrible\\ndeed--burn the house down over our heads, or kill himself when the\\nattendant was not watching, or some other horrible deed of that kind.\\nWhen he did succeed in mutilating himself before any of us was aware\\nof it, instead of sending him back to the asylum, to be cared for, you\\nkept him here under lock and key thinking to cure him yourself in a\\ncouple of months or so.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" thought Ida May, leaning faint and dizzy against the wall, \"now\\nI understand why Mrs. Deering consented to let me go away. Anything to\\nget me out of the house while she was curing the insane nephew whom she\\nhad vowed I must wed.\"\\n\\nThe next words, while they shocked her inexpressively, lifted a world\\nof woe from her heart.\\n\\n\"Well, despite our watchfulness, he succeeded in killing himself at\\nlast; so there\\'s the end of it. The fortune is lost, and there\\'s no use\\nin raving over it, and in venting your bitter wrath upon everything and\\nevery one that comes within your range.\"\\n\\nMrs. Deering\\'s anger was so great that she could not utter a word. She\\nflung open the door and dashed into the hall. The very first object\\nthat met her gaze was the cowering little figure leaning against the\\nbalustrade.\\n\\n\"You!\" she cried, quite as soon as she could catch her breath. \"How\\ndare you come here, Ida May, you wicked girl! I am amazed that you have\\nthe effrontery to face honest people after what you have done! We read\\nall about it in the newspapers--how you ran away from Newport with a\\ngay, dashing fellow who soon after deserted you. Don\\'t attempt to tell\\nme anything about it. I won\\'t listen to a word. Get out of this house\\nas quick as you can! Go, before I bid the servants throw you from the\\nhouse!\"\\n\\n\"But my mother! Surely you will let me see my mother!\" sobbed the\\ngirl, piteously. \"The whole wide world may be against me, but she will\\nbelieve me guiltless! _Please_ let me see her.\"\\n\\nA laugh that was horrible to hear broke from Mrs. Deering\\'s thin lips.\\n\\n\"Your mother!\" she sneered; \"much you cared about her, or how your\\ndoings affected her. That article in the newspapers did the work, as\\nyou might have known it would. I carried the paper to her myself, and\\nwhen she read it she fell to the floor with a bitter cry, and she never\\nspoke again. It was her death-warrant!\"\\n\\nFor one moment the girl looked at the woman with frightened eyes, as\\nthough she could not quite comprehend the full import of what the woman\\nwas saying.\\n\\n\"It killed your mother!\" she repeated pitilessly. \"You might have known\\nit would. She died of a broken heart!\"\\n\\nA long, low moan came from the girl\\'s lips. The awful despair in the\\ndark eyes would have touched any other heart, even though it were made\\nof stone; but in Mrs. Deering\\'s heart there was neither pity nor mercy.\\n\\n\"Go!\" she repeated, threateningly, \"and do not dare to ever darken my\\ndoor again!\"\\n\\n\"Will you tell me where you have buried my poor mother?\" moaned Ida\\nMay, with bitter anguish.\\n\\n\"In the lot where the poor of the village are put,\" she answered,\\nunfeelingly. \"We had to have a mark put over her. You can easily find\\nit. It\\'s to the left-hand corner, the last one on the row. It would be\\nbetter for you, you shameless girl, if you were lying beside her rather\\nthan sink to the lowest depths of the road you are traveling. Go--go at\\nonce!\"\\n\\nWith trembling feet she crept down the broad path and out of the gate.\\nShe was drenched to the skin, and the chill October winds pierced\\nthrough her thin wet clothes like the sharp cut of a knife. It did not\\nmatter much; nothing mattered for her any more. She was going to find\\nher mother\\'s grave, kneel down beside it, lay her tired head on the\\nlittle green mound, and wait there for death to come to her, for surely\\nGod would grant her prayer and in pity reach out His hand to her and\\ntake her home. There would be a home _there_ where her mother was, even\\nif all other doors were closed to her.\\n\\nShe had little difficulty in finding the place--a small inclosure in\\nthe rear of the old church that had fallen into decay and crumbling\\nruins many years ago--and by the blinding flashes of lightning, she\\nfound the grave of her mother--her poor, suffering mother, the only\\nbeing who had ever loved her in the great, cold, desolate earth.\\n\\n\"Mother,\" she sobbed, laying her face on the cold, wet leaves that\\ncovered the mound, \"mother, I have come to you to die. The world has\\ngone all wrong with me. I never meant to go wrong. I do not know how it\\nhappened. Other young girls have married the lovers whom they thought\\nGod had sent to them, and lived happy enough lives. I built such\\nglorious air-castles of the home I should have, the handsome, strong\\nyoung husband to love and to labor for me, and how you should live with\\nme, mother, never having to work any more. But oh, mother, all my plans\\nwent wrong! I don\\'t know why.\"\\n\\nIda May crouched there among the sleeping dead, her brain in a whirl;\\nand the long night wore on. The storm subsided, the wind died away over\\nthe tossing trees and the far-off hills, and the rain ceased. Morning\\nbroke faint and gray in the eastern sky, and the flecks of crimson\\nalong the horizon presaged a bright and gladsome day.\\n\\nThe station-agent, hurrying along to his duties at that early hour,\\nwas startled to see a dark figure lying among the graves. In a moment\\nhe was bending over the prostrate form. He could not distinguish in\\nthe dim light whose grave it was upon which the poor creature was\\nlying, but as he lifted the slender figure, and the faint, early light\\nfell upon the white, beautiful young face, he started back with an\\nexclamation of horror.\\n\\n\"Great God! it is little Ida May!\"\\n\\nFor an instant he was incapable of action, his surprise was so intense.\\n\\n\"Dead!\" he muttered, cold drops of perspiration standing out like beads\\non his perturbed brow. \"Little Ida May dead on her mother\\'s grave!\\nGod, how pitiful! She was so young to die!\"\\n\\nThen he knelt down beside her in the thick, wet grass, and placed his\\nhand over her heart in the wild hope that a spark of life might yet be\\nthere.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI.\\n\\n\\nWith bated breath, Hugh Rowland, the station-agent, knelt down in the\\ndew-wet grass, and placed his hand over the girl\\'s heart. Although the\\nsweet white face upturned to the gray morning light was as white as\\ndeath, he cried out sharply to himself: \"Her heart still beats! God be\\npraised! There is life in her yet!\"\\n\\nGathering her in his arms, as though she were a little child, he\\ncarried her quickly across lots to the station, and placed her upon a\\nrude bench. Once there, he could control himself no longer. He dropped\\nupon his knees beside her, burying his face in the folds of her wet\\ndress, chafing her hands, and sobbing as though his heart would break.\\n\\nHe had loved the girl lying there so stark and motionless as he had\\nnever loved anything in his life before; but he had never dared to tell\\nher of it. Though he was station-agent, and she a telegraph operator,\\nshe seemed as far above him as the star is from the earth.\\n\\nFor a moment Hugh Rowland had almost lost control of himself; then he\\nremembered how horribly cold she was, and he had the presence of mind\\nto start a fire in the big stove that always stood in the center of the\\nwaiting-room.\\n\\nThe grateful heat that rose from it quickly brought the breath of life\\nto the girl\\'s white lips. The great, dark, somber eyes opened wide, and\\nshe saw the rugged, kindly face of the young station-agent bending over\\nher.\\n\\n\"I found you--you had fainted in the graveyard,\" he said. \"Luckily\\nenough, I was just passing, and I brought you here.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, why didn\\'t you let me die?\" moaned the girl, so bitterly that he\\nwas shocked.\\n\\n\"It is very wicked to talk like that,\" he said, forcing down the great\\nlump that rose in his throat.\\n\\n\"No!\" she cried, vehemently. \"How could it be very wrong to leave a\\ngreat, cold, cruel world in which nobody wants you. I have nothing to\\nlive for.\"\\n\\n\"But somebody does want you, Ida May!\" cried the great rough fellow,\\nwith tears that were no disgrace to his manhood coursing down his\\ncheek. \"I want you with all my heart!\"\\n\\n\"Hush, hush, hush!\" she cried; \"you must not talk so to me!\" she cried.\\n\"Don\\'t say any more! It can never be! You do not know all!\"\\n\\n\"Do not say me nay. Give me the right to protect you, Ida. We can go\\naway from this village. I can get a job on the road anywhere along the\\nline. I will work for you, and tend to you so very carefully that you\\nwill forget the past!\"\\n\\nShe only turned away from him, pleading with him for the love of Heaven\\nto say no more. He stopped short, looking at her gloomily. He had used\\nall the words that he could command, and they had been of no avail. She\\nwould not even listen.\\n\\n\"One moment more!\" he cried, hoarsely. \"Always remember, Ida May, that\\nyou leave behind you a heart that beats only for you--only for you. No\\nother woman\\'s face shall ever win my love from you. I will wait here,\\nwhere you leave me, for long years, until you come back to me--ay, I\\nwill wait from day to day with this one hope in my heart: Some day she\\nwill come back to me; she will find the world too cold and hard, and\\nwill come back to me to comfort her. I will watch for you from darkness\\nuntil day dawns again. My form, so straight now, may grow bent with\\nyears, my hair grow white, and lines seam my face, but through it all I\\nshall watch for your coming until God rewards my vigilance. Good-bye,\\nand God bless you, Ida May, oh love of my heart!\"\\n\\nShe passed from his sight with those words ringing in her ears, and\\nwhen the New York express passed on again after she had boarded it,\\nthe young station-agent fell prone upon his face to the floor, and lay\\nthere like one dead.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII.\\n\\n\\nFew passengers turned to look at the little figure that entered the car\\nat the way-side station at so early an hour of the morning, and Ida May\\ncowered quickly down into the first seat. The clothes under the long,\\ndark cloak were saturated, but no one could see that, nor notice how\\ndamp and matted were the curling rings of dark hair which the hood of\\nthe cloak but half concealed. The hours crept on as the express whirled\\nover the rails; but Ida May paid no heed to time.\\n\\nBut hunger at last began to tell upon her, and she eagerly hailed a\\nboy who passed through the train with a basket of sandwiches on his arm.\\n\\nShe looked at the coins she still held loosely in her hand, and found\\nto her dismay that, with the exception of two pieces of silver, she\\nheld a handful of gold dollars.\\n\\n\"His pocket-pieces,\" she sobbed. \"Oh, if I had known that, I would have\\nrefused to take them; but--but I will work and earn money, and--and pay\\nhim back double their value. Poor fellow--poor fellow!\" and she laid\\nher face on the window-sill, sobbing as though her heart would break.\\n\\nSuddenly she heard a voice in the seat back of her say:\\n\\n\"You seem very much distressed, poor girl. Is there any way in which I\\ncan serve you?\"\\n\\nThe deep, musical voice was so kind, so humane, so sympathetic, that\\nIda May turned around with a start to see who it was who had asked the\\nquestion.\\n\\nShe saw directly back of her a fair, handsome young man who had\\nevidently just entered the car, and who was depositing his grip-sack\\nand umbrella in the rack above his head.\\n\\nAt the first glance a faint shriek broke from her lips. She was just\\nabout to cry out, \"Royal Ainsley--great Heaven!--do we meet again?\"\\nwhen she saw her error in time. Although bearing a certain resemblance\\nto the lover who had so cruelly betrayed her, a second glance told her\\nit was not him.\\n\\nIt was a moment ere she recovered herself sufficiently to answer, then\\nshe faltered, piteously:\\n\\n\"I _am_ in sorrow, sir, so great that I do not think any young girl\\nbut me could ever pass through it--and live.\"\\n\\n\"I do not wish to pry into your private affairs,\" said the young man,\\ncourteously, \"but I wish to repeat, if you will tell me what troubles\\nyou, and I can be of service to you, I shall be only too pleased.\\nAlthough a stranger, you will find me worthy of your confidence, my\\npoor child!\"\\n\\nThere was something about the handsome, kindly, blue-eyed young man\\nthat caused Ida May\\'s heart to go out to him at once. His was a face\\nthat women always trusted, and no one had ever had cause to regret it.\\n\\n\"I am going to New York in search of work,\" faltered the girl, clasping\\nher little hands closely together.\\n\\n\"That is certainly reason enough to weep,\" he replied earnestly. \"May I\\nask if you have friends there to whom you are going until you can find\\nemployment?\"\\n\\nIda May shook her head, her breast heaved, her white lips quivered,\\nwhile great tears welled up to the great dark eyes, so like purple\\nvelvet <DW29>s drowned in rain.\\n\\n\"I have no friends--no one. I am all alone in the world, sir,\" she\\nsobbed. \"My mother is dead--dead. I have just left her grave. She and\\nI were all in all to each other; now she is gone, and I--Oh, only the\\nangels know that no sorrow is so bleak, so pitiful, so awful, as to be\\nall alone in the world.\"\\n\\n\"I can understand the situation perfectly,\" he answered in a low voice,\\n\"and I can pity you. Although not quite alone in the world myself, I am\\nalmost as badly off. But to return to yourself: I may be able to serve\\nyou. What kind of employment were you intending to search for? In some\\nstore, or dress-making or millinery establishment?\" he queried.\\n\\nShe looked blankly up into his fair, handsome, earnest face.\\n\\n\"I do not know how to do anything of that kind,\" she answered, simply.\\n\"I thought perhaps I might find employment in some telegraph office.\"\\n\\n\"Why, yes, indeed. I wonder that that idea did not occur to me before.\\nA friend of mine is superintendent of a large branch of the Western\\nUnion, up Broadway. I will give you a note to him, and I have no doubt\\nhe will do all in his power to aid you, providing he has a vacancy.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, thank you a thousand times, sir,\" cried Ida May, thankfully; \"I\\nshall be so grateful--oh, so very grateful!\"\\n\\n\"Mind, it is not a certainty, you know,\" admonished the stranger\\nearnestly; \"I can only write the letter. But that is not assuring you\\nof a situation--we can only hope for it.\"\\n\\nHe tore out a leaf from his memorandum, and taking a gold pencil from\\nhis vest pocket, hastily jotted down a few lines upon it.\\n\\n\"I am sorry I am not going through to New York; otherwise I would take\\nyou there myself,\" he said, courteously, as he folded up the note and\\nhanded it to her.\\n\\nAt that moment his station was reached. He had barely time to touch his\\nhat to her, gather up his parcels, and alight, ere the train moved out\\nagain. The young man looked after it and the sweet, tearful young face\\npressed against one of the windows until it was out of sight.\\n\\n\"By all that is wonderful!\" he ejaculated in a very troubled voice, \"I\\nam almost positive that I forgot to sign my name to that note, and it\\nwas written so badly on that jolting car, Ernscourt won\\'t be able to\\nmake it out or know whose writing it is. Poor little girl! I hope she\\nwill find a position there. What a terrible thing it is to be young\\nand desolate in the great wicked city of New York! She is so young,\\nguileless and innocent, I hope no ill will befall her. I must remember\\nto look up my friend Ernscourt to learn if he gave her a position or\\nnot. I declare, if it were not that I am betrothed to the sweetest girl\\nin all the world, I am afraid I should commit the desperate folly of\\nfalling in love with that beautiful, dark-eyed little stranger. Now\\nthat I think of it, it did not occur to me to even ask her name or\\nwhere she was from.\"\\n\\nHis reverie was somewhat rudely interrupted by a hearty slap on the\\nshoulder and a hearty voice calling out gayly:\\n\\n\"Why, Royal, how are you, old fellow? What, in the name of all that\\'s\\namazing, brings you to Yonkers?\"\\n\\n\"Why, Hal, is this you?\" cried the other, in astonishment and delight.\\n\"This is an additional pleasure, meeting my old college chum fully a\\nthousand miles from where I would never have imagined finding him. But\\na word in your ear, my dear boy: It\\'s two years since you and I parted\\nat college, old fellow, and a great deal has happened in that time. We\\nwill walk up the street while I inform you.\"\\n\\n\"With the greatest of pleasure, Royal,\" returned his companion.\\n\\n\"Tut! tut! Don\\'t call me Royal--Royal Ainsley. I\\'m that no longer, you\\nknow--no, I suppose you don\\'t know; but that\\'s exactly what I want to\\ntalk to you about.\"\\n\\n\"I am too astonished for utterance,\" declared his friend.\\n\\n\"Why, the explanation is certainly simple enough,\" declared the other,\\nwith a good-natured, mellow little laugh; adding: \"Why, you, my college\\nchum, knew what many another friend of mine does _not_ know, namely,\\nthat there are two Royal Ainsleys, or, rather, there was up to the\\npresent year. It\\'s a bit of secret family history; but I am obliged to\\ntake you into my confidence, in order that you may fully understand my\\nmost peculiar position. Two brothers, who were almost enemies born,\\nmarried about the same time, and to each of the gentlemen--namely, my\\nuncle and my father, was born a son--my cousin and myself.\\n\\n\"These gentlemen had an eccentric elder brother who had money to burn,\\nas the saying is, and what should each of these younger brothers do but\\nname their sons after the wealthy old Royal Ainsley, if you please,\\neach hoping that _his_ son would be the old uncle\\'s heir.\\n\\n\"A pretty mess these two belligerent gentlemen made of the affair,\\nI assure you. Two Royal Ainsleys, each resembling the other to an\\nunpleasantly startling degree, of almost the same age, being born\\nscarcely a week apart.\\n\\n\"We were constantly getting into all manner of scrapes, a case of being\\ncontinually taken for the fellow that looks like me, as the song goes.\\nEach disputed with the other the right to bear the name, and neither\\nwould put a handle to it or do anything to cause it to differ in any\\nway from the cognomen of the famous old uncle, who was certainly quite\\nas bewildered as any one else.\\n\\n\"As we two lads grew older, I took to books, my cousin to sports\\nand the pretty faces of girls. When his folks died and he was left\\nto follow the bent of his own inclination, in spite of my earnest\\nadmonition and my uncle\\'s combined, he jumped the traces of home\\nrestraint altogether, and started out to see life on his own hook. The\\nlast I heard of him he was with some distant relative, clerking in a\\nNew York importing house.\\n\\n\"Now for _my_ side of the story. From the hour he defied uncle and\\nshook off his restraint, old Royal Ainsley\\'s hatred of him grew so\\nbitter we dared not mention my wayward cousin, Royal Ainsley, in\\nhis presence. My uncle actually forced me to change my name through\\nlegislative enactment to make it legal. He insisted upon naming me\\nEugene Mallard, declaring that my cousin would be sure to disgrace the\\nname of Royal Ainsley through the length and breadth of the land before\\nhe stopped in his mad downward career.\\n\\n\"Well, to make a long story short, my uncle sent me to Europe on\\nbusiness for him, and his sudden death brought me hurriedly home\\nthis week, to find that he has left me his entire fortune, with the\\nproviso that not one dollar shall ever go to my cousin, who, in all\\nprobability, does not yet know of his sad plight.\\n\\n\"Now, last but by no means least, on the steamer coming back from\\nLondon I met a beautiful young girl, Miss Hildegarde Cramer. It was a\\ncase of love at first sight between us. You know I\\'m a very impulsive\\nfellow. I proposed, and she accepted me on the spot; but mind, she\\nknows me as Eugene Mallard, and so she shall know me to the end of her\\nsweet life, bless her.\\n\\n\"Now you know the whole story. Mind, I\\'m not Royal Ainsley, but,\\ninstead, Eugene Mallard, at your service.\\n\\n\"Hildegarde is visiting in Yonkers, so I ran up to see my sweetheart.\\nSounds like a romance or a comedy, doesn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\"I hope there will be no tinge of tragedy in it,\" laughed his friend,\\nthoughtlessly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII.\\n\\n\\nWith a note of introduction to the superintendent clutched tightly\\nin her hand, Ida May reached New York City. She took barely time to\\nswallow a cup of coffee ere she hurried to the number indicated. Her\\nheart sunk within her as she looked up at the immense building; but\\nwith a courage which should have met with a better reward, she took\\nthe elevator, and soon found herself on the eighth floor, where the\\nsuperintendent\\'s office was situated.\\n\\n\"He is not in,\" an attendant told her. \"He left the city two days ago,\\nand is not expected to return for a fortnight.\"\\n\\nTears that she could not control sprung into Ida May\\'s dark eyes.\\n\\n\"Oh, what shall I do?\" cried the girl; \"I want to see him so much!\"\\n\\nThe attendant was moved to pity by her great distress.\\n\\n\"If you are looking for a position, or anything of that kind, perhaps I\\ncould suggest something.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, that is it, sir,\" exclaimed Ida May, looking up through her\\ntears--\"that is my errand. I want to secure a position.\"\\n\\n\"Then it is the manager, instead of the superintendent, you will have\\nto apply to. I think he is in his office. Step this way, please.\"\\n\\nHe threw open a door to the right, and Ida May followed him into a\\nlarge room, in which were dozens of young girls bending over tables.\\n\\nThe deafening click! click! click! of the telegraph instruments drowned\\nevery sound.\\n\\nSome girls never raised their heads, as Ida May, following the\\nattendant, passed down the long aisle. Others, however, glanced at her,\\nat first casually, which deepened instantly into a gaze of curiosity\\nand intense interest, for they had never beheld a creature with such\\nsuperb beauty. Their hearts beat with envy.\\n\\n\"The manager will be sure to engage her,\" they whispered. \"Her pretty\\nface will be sure to be a passport to favor. There used to be a time\\nwhen it was \\'How much do you know about the business?\\' but now it is\\n\\'What kind of a face have you? If it\\'s a pretty and dashing one, I\\'ll\\nengage you.\\' An old or a homely girl doesn\\'t stand any show whatever\\nnowadays.\"\\n\\nAll unconscious of these remarks, Ida May passed on. The attendant\\nthrew open another door at the end of a large room, and she found\\nherself in a luxuriously furnished office. A young and exceedingly\\nhandsome man sat at a desk writing. He glanced up angrily at the sound\\nof footsteps, and was about to make a sharp remark to the man, when he\\ncaught sight of the beautiful young creature he was ushering into his\\npresence.\\n\\n\"Ah, sit down,\" he said, blandly; \"I will attend to you in one moment.\"\\n\\nThe attendant had scarcely closed the door behind him ere the\\nmanager--for such he proved to be--turned quickly about and faced the\\nyoung girl.\\n\\n\"What can I do for you?\" he said in his blandest voice. He had taken\\nin at first glance the wondrous beauty of the young girl. It was\\ncertainly the most exquisite face he had ever beheld, and a strange\\ngleam leaped into his eyes. He told himself that, from her appearance,\\nshe had certainly come in search of a position. Ida May looked up into\\nthe dark, handsome face. Instinctively she shrunk from him, but could\\nnot tell why. Very timidly she stated her errand, the color on her\\nface deepening, as she could not help but notice the ardent glance of\\nadmiration he bent upon her, and there was something in the bold glance\\nof his eyes that made her feel extremely uncomfortable.\\n\\nIn a falteringly voice Ida stated her errand, and what experience she\\nhad had in her little village home. To her great delight and surprise,\\nhe answered quickly:\\n\\n\"I think I will be able to make a place for you. It would be a pity to\\nsend away such a pretty girl as you are.\"\\n\\nIda May drew back in alarm. She did not like the remark, nor the look\\nwhich accompanied it; but she dared not make an indignant reply.\\n\\n\"Where are you stopping?\" he asked in the next breath.\\n\\n\"I have just reached the city, sir,\" she responded. \"I came in search\\nof a position even before I found a place to stop.\"\\n\\n\"It is well you did so,\" he responded quickly. \"I know of a place that\\nI think will suit you. The lady has no other boarders. You would be\\ncompany for her. I would make this observation here and now: the girls\\nwe have here are a talkative set. Pay no attention to their remarks.\"\\n\\nHe wrote an address on a slip of paper, and handed it to the girl.\\n\\n\"I am very grateful, sir, for the interest you have taken in me, a poor\\ngirl,\" she said, tremulously. \"Shall I report to-day for work, sir?\"\\nshe asked. \"I should like to commence as soon as possible.\"\\n\\n\"To-morrow will do,\" he answered.\\n\\nWith a heart full of thanks, she left the office.\\n\\nFrank Garrick, the manager, looked after her with a smile that was not\\npleasant to see.\\n\\n\"I have run across many a little beauty in my time,\" he muttered,\\ngazing after her, \"but surely never such an exquisite little beauty as\\nthis one.\"\\n\\nThe girls looked at one another, nodding grimly, when Ida May presented\\nherself for duty the next day.\\n\\n\"Didn\\'t I tell you how it would be?\" sneered one of the girls. \"Our\\nhandsome manager, Mr. Garrick, was captivated by the girl\\'s beauty, as\\nI knew he would be, and engaged her, although he refused to take on,\\nonly the day before, three girls whom I knew to be actually starving.\"\\n\\nThere was one girl who looked at Ida May with darkening eyes.\\n\\nShe bent over her task; but though the hours passed, the terrible look\\nnever left her face.\\n\\n\"Nannie is jealous,\" more than one girl whispered to her neighbor. \"You\\nsee, she\\'s head over heels in love with our manager. If he so much as\\nlooks at any other girl that passes along, she sulks for a week. What\\nfun it would be to make her jealous. Oh, let\\'s try, girls! Let\\'s put up\\na job on her. It would be such fun!\"\\n\\n\"Not for the new-comer!\" laughed another girl.\\n\\n\"Nannie would make it pretty hot for her here.\"\\n\\nLittle dreaming of the tempest they were stirring up, the girls\\nthoughtlessly planned their little joke. Their shouts of laughter would\\nhave been turned into tears of pity could they have beheld the harvest\\nof woe that was to spring from it.\\n\\nNannie Rogers noticed that the beautiful new-comer was assigned to an\\ninstrument at a table almost directly opposite the private office. This\\ninflamed the jealously of Nannie Rogers.\\n\\nShe noted how he watched her from the window of his office all the next\\nday.\\n\\nMore than one girl called Nannie Rogers\\' attention to this at noon-hour.\\n\\n\"You will have to look to your laurels, Nan,\" more than one declared,\\nbanteringly. \"You will find this Ida May a rival, I fear.\"\\n\\n\"Any girl had better be dead than attempt to be a rival of mine,\" she\\nanswered.\\n\\nThere came a time when the girls remembered that remark all too\\nforcibly.\\n\\nIda May bent over her task, paying little attention to anything around\\nher. She was trying to forget her double sorrow, all that she had gone\\nthrough, and the death of her poor mother that had followed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV.\\n\\n\\nIda May had found no difficulty whatever in securing board at the place\\nwhere Frank Garrick had suggested.\\n\\nMrs. Cole, who owned the cottage, told Ida that she was a widow.\\n\\n\"I have a little income that keeps me comfortable,\" she added; \"but to\\naccommodate my friend, Mr. Garrick, I will take you in.\"\\n\\n\"He is a friend of yours?\" exclaimed the girl.\\n\\n\"Yes; I used to be in the telegraph office before I married,\" she\\nresponded. \"In fact, my husband and Mr. Garrick were both paying\\nattention to me at the same time. To be candid, I liked Mr. Garrick\\nthe better; but we had a little misunderstanding, and through pique\\nI married his rival. I lost sight of him after that until my husband\\ndied. After I became a widow he called upon me several times.\"\\n\\nShe gave the impression to Ida that she expected a proposal from her\\nold lover some time in the near future, but the girl paid little heed\\nto the blushing widow. Her thoughts were elsewhere.\\n\\nOne evening, at the end of the second week, as Ida was hurrying\\nhomeward, she was startled by a step behind her.\\n\\n\"You seem to be in a hurry, Miss May,\" a voice said; and turning\\nquickly around, she beheld the handsome manager, Mr. Garrick.\\n\\n\"I _am_ in a hurry!\" she assented. \"I am a little late now, and Mrs.\\nCole does not like me to keep supper waiting.\"\\n\\n\"Never mind what she likes,\" he returned, impatiently. \"Let us take a\\nlittle walk, I have something to say to you, pretty one.\"\\n\\nThere was something in his eyes, his voice, that somehow startled her.\\n\\n\"Pardon me, but I do not care to walk,\" she said, simply, with the\\nhaughty air of a young princess.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t put on airs,\" he said, harshly; \"you are not very wise to try to\\nsnub a manager who has the power to turn you out of your position at\\nany moment.\"\\n\\nIda grew frightfully pale.\\n\\n\"Come, let us take a little walk,\" he urged. \"You\\'re a very pretty\\ngirl, and I like you.\"\\n\\nIda May drew back with an exclamation of alarm.\\n\\n\"I refuse to walk with you!\" she said.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t make an enemy of me, Ida May!\" he hissed between his teeth.\\n\\n\"If such a trifle will make an enemy, I would rather make an enemy than\\na friend of you!\" she answered.\\n\\n\"Are you mad, girl, to defy me like this?\" he cried, setting his white\\nteeth together, his eyes fairly blazing.\\n\\n\"I have no wish to defy you! I can not see why my refusing to walk with\\nyou should offend you!\"\\n\\n\"Come, be reasonable,\" he urged; \"let us have a little quiet talk. I\\nhave called at your boarding-house half a dozen times since you have\\nbeen there, but that idiotic fool, who is half in love with me herself,\\nwould not let me see you. I might have known how it would be: I\\'ll look\\nfor another boarding-place at once for you.\"\\n\\nThe interest he took in her alarmed her.\\n\\n\"I am very well satisfied where I am, Mr. Garrick,\" she answered, with\\ndignity. \"I beg that you will not call upon me, for I do not care to\\nreceive gentlemen callers.\"\\n\\nAgain a rage that was terrible to see flashed into his eyes.\\n\\n\"You _must_ see me!\" he hissed. \"It is not for you to be chooser.\\nDon\\'t you see I have taken a fancy to you,\" he said, throwing off all\\nreserve. \"You must be mine! I never really knew what love meant until I\\nsaw you!\"\\n\\n\"Stop! Stop!\" panted Ida May. \"I will not listen to another word. You\\nmust not talk to me of love!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I loved you, Ida May, from the first time I saw you. There was\\nsomething about you which thrilled my heart and caused me to wish that\\nyou should be mine, cost what it would!\"\\n\\n\"I will not listen to another word!\" said Ida May.\\n\\nHe laughed an insolent laugh that made the blood fairly boil in her\\nveins.\\n\\n\"Come, we will go into this restaurant where we can talk at our\\nleisure.\"\\n\\nHe had caught her by the arm. With a cry of terror the girl wrenched\\nherself free from his grasp and fairly flew down the street, and she\\ndid not stop until she reached her boarding-house.\\n\\n\"Why, dear me, Miss May, one would think you were flying from a\\ncyclone!\" declared Mrs. Cole, who was just passing through the hall as\\nshe came in.\\n\\nGasping for breath, and scarcely able to keep from tears, Ida May told\\nher all, believing that the woman would sympathize with her.\\n\\n\"Why, you are more of a prude than I thought you were,\" said Mrs. Cole.\\n\\nIda May drew back with dilated eyes.\\n\\n\"You, a woman, to tell me this! Why, I tell you he was insulting me!\"\\ncried the girl, vehemently.\\n\\nMrs. Cole laughed cynically.\\n\\n\"Nonsense!\" she declared. \"You might do worse than accept his\\nattentions. He\\'s over head and heels in love with you. I could have\\ntold you that a week ago.\"\\n\\n\"He is a bold, bad man!\" cried Ida May. \"And yet you would counsel me\\nto encourage him wouldn\\'t you?\"\\n\\nThe elder woman shrugged her shoulders.\\n\\n\"Any one could easily see that you are a country girl,\" she said, with\\na harsh laugh that grated on the girl who listened with amazement.\\n\\nWith this parting shot the woman turned on her heel and left Ida May\\nstaring after her.\\n\\nTo Ida\\'s intense anxiety, her landlady was unusually cool at the\\ntea-table. She did not come up to Ida May\\'s room that evening to chat,\\nbut announced that she had a headache, needed quiet, and would stay\\nin her own room. Her presence during the long evenings had done much\\ntoward making the girl forget her sorrow, and she felt her absence\\nkeenly enough on this night when she had so much need of sympathy.\\n\\nFeeling too restless to commune with her own thoughts, she concluded to\\nread a book to fill in the time that hung so heavily on her hands.\\n\\nIda May descended to the sitting-room, where, she remembered, she had\\nleft the book on the table. She went down the carpeted stairs quietly,\\npassing Mrs. Cole\\'s door with noiseless feet, that she might not\\ndisturb her.\\n\\nAs she stood before the door of the sitting-room, with her hand on the\\nknob, she was suddenly attracted by the sound of voices from within,\\nher own name falling distinctly upon her ears. She stood still with\\nastonishment, for the voice that uttered her name was that of Frank\\nGarrick.\\n\\nHer first impulse was to turn quickly away; but the words that she\\nheard him utter held her spell-bound.\\n\\nMr. Garrick was talking to Mrs. Cole in a low, excited voice, and what\\nthe girl heard filled her soul with wildest terror.\\n\\nFor a moment she stood irresolute; then her decision was made. As soon\\nas the morning broke, she would leave that house.\\n\\nShe flew back to her room, her mind in a whirl, her brain dizzy with\\nconflicting emotions. She sat down in a chair by the open window,\\nand leaned her hot, flushed face in the palms of her hands. She was\\nbeginning to learn the lessons of the great, wicked world. How long she\\nsat there she never knew.\\n\\nShe was planning about what she should do when the morrow came. Though\\nshe starved on the street, she would not go back to the telegraph\\noffice where Frank Garrick was; nor could she remain in the house that\\nnow sheltered her, where the woman who pretended to be her friend and\\ncounselor was deliberately plotting against her.\\n\\nShe had purchased a dress, cloak, and hat out of the money she had\\nfound in her pocket. This expenditure had reduced the little sum\\nconsiderably; but she had been obliged to present a respectable\\nappearance.\\n\\nWhere should she look for work in the great big city? While she was\\ncogitating over the matter, Mrs. Cole appeared in the door-way with a\\nglass of lemonade in her hand.\\n\\n\"I have brought you something very refreshing, Ida,\" she said. \"It took\\naway _my_ headache, and it will make you enjoy a good night\\'s sleep.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, but I do not care for the lemonade,\" returned the girl,\\ncoldly.\\n\\nHer first impulse had been to spring to her feet, and inform her that\\nshe had accidently overheard her conversation with Frank Garrick, and\\nupbraid her for it in the bitterest of words. Then the thought occurred\\nto her that discretion was the better part of valor--to say nothing,\\nand leave the house quietly in the morning.\\n\\n\"But I insist upon your drinking the lemonade,\" declared the young\\nwidow.\\n\\nIda looked at her steadily, and something in the reproachful glance of\\nthe girl\\'s eyes made her wince. The hand that held the glass shook in\\nspite of her efforts at composure.\\n\\n\"It will induce an excellent night\\'s sleep, my dear,\" said Mrs. Cole,\\nsmoothly. \"Stir it up; you are letting all the sugar settle at the\\nbottom.\"\\n\\n\"I do not care for it,\" repeated Ida, a trifle more haughtily.\\n\\n\"But as it is for your good, you _must_ drink it!\" repeated her\\ncompanion. \"I shall not leave the room until you do so.\"\\n\\nAt that moment Katie, the little maid of all work, entered the room\\nwith towels.\\n\\nPassing near the back of her chair, she managed to whisper in her ear,\\nunobserved by Mrs. Cole:\\n\\n\"Promise her to drink the lemonade if she will leave it on the table;\\nbut don\\'t touch a drop of it. I\\'ll tell you why later.\"\\n\\nThe remark was accompanied by a warning glance from the girl\\'s eyes.\\nLaying down the towels, Katie retreated to the door; but the warning\\nlook that she cast back at her aroused Ida May.\\n\\n\"Set the glass down, and I will drink the lemonade later on,\" she said,\\nquietly.\\n\\n\"Do you promise me that you will?\" said Mrs. Cole, with unusual\\ninterest.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Ida, hesitatingly. \"Put it down on the table.\"\\n\\n\"I will come back in ten minutes,\" declared Mrs. Cole, \"and if you have\\nnot drunk it by that time--well, I\\'ll make you, that\\'s all,\" she added,\\nwith a forced laugh, but meaning just what she said.\\n\\nIda May sat down when she found herself alone, wondering in amazement\\nwhat Katie could have meant by her strange words. At that moment the\\ngirl glided into the room.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV.\\n\\n\\n\"Oh! do not touch it, my dear young lady!\" cried Katie, rushing into\\nthe room and seizing the lemonade with hands that were trembling.\\n\"Listen, miss,\" she cried in an awful whisper. \"They put something into\\nit--the lemonade is drugged!\"\\n\\nIda May looked at her with the utmost astonishment. She could scarcely\\nunderstand her words.\\n\\n\"I saw them do it!\" repeated the girl. \"I heard him say, \\'Put in\\nenough, and it will make her sleep soundly.\\' It was a white powder he\\nhad brought with him,\" the maid went on, excitedly. \"Oh, he makes such\\na dupe of my poor mistress! He has hypnotized her so that she is afraid\\nto say that her soul is her own. I heard a great deal more that he\\nsaid, but I can not tell you now. All I can do is to warn you. Go away\\nfrom here as quickly as you can. They are enemies of yours, both of\\nthem.\"\\n\\nThe girl\\'s words terrified Ida May. She recalled Frank Garrick\\'s words\\nas he walked along the street beside her.\\n\\n\"Take care! beware, girl! You had better not make an enemy of me! If\\nyou do, you will rue the hour! For I can make it very unpleasant for\\nyou. Ay, you will be sorry that you were ever born.\"\\n\\nShe _had_ made an enemy of him, and now he was about to take some\\nterrible revenge upon her. She did not have time to exchange another\\nword with the maid, for she had fled from the room as quickly as she\\nhad entered it, and she was left alone with her conflicting thoughts.\\n\\nThe window was open, and she threw the contents of the glass out on the\\npavement below.\\n\\nShe had scarcely set it down, before Mrs. Cole glided into the room.\\n\\n\"Ah! you have drunk the lemonade. That\\'s right!\" she added in a\\ntriumphant tone. \"But I won\\'t sit down to talk to you to-night; you\\nlook sleepy. I would advise you to retire at once.\"\\n\\nIda looked at her steadily, remembering the startling words that Katie\\nhad whispered in her ears. Was this a woman or a fiend incarnate? Ida\\nwondered.\\n\\nHer footsteps had scarcely died away ere Ida took down a long dark\\ncloak, and hurriedly donning it, together with her hat and veil, she\\ngathered her effects together, and thrusting them into a hand-bag,\\nstole silently as a shadow out into the darkened hall. As she passed\\nthe sitting-room door she heard the sound of voices.\\n\\nFrank Garrick was still there.\\n\\nIn the shadow of the vestibule door she saw Katie waiting for her.\\n\\n\"Good-bye, and God bless you, Ida May!\" she said, holding out her\\nrough, toil-worn little hand.\\n\\n\"Good-bye, and thank you for the service you have rendered me,\" she\\nanswered, with deep feeling. \"If we ever meet again, perhaps it may be\\nin my power to repay you,\" added Ida, the tears standing out on her\\nlong lashes.\\n\\nShe little dreamed that the hour would come when she would be called\\nupon to remember that promise.\\n\\nOut of the house she stole, out into the darkness of the street.\\n\\nAt last, when faint and almost falling down from exhaustion, she ran\\ndirectly into the arms of a blue coat who was leisurely passing a\\ncorner.\\n\\n\"Halloo there, my good girl!\" he cried. \"What are you doing out at this\\nhour of the night?\"\\n\\nTrembling piteously, and all unnerved at this unexpected encounter, for\\na moment the girl was speechless.\\n\\n\"I am trying to find shelter until to-morrow morning, sir,\" she said.\\n\"Then I shall look for work.\"\\n\\nBut the officer would not parley with her. He grasped her by the arm,\\nand was forcing the sobbing girl along, when he was suddenly confronted\\nby a young man who was passing, and who had witnessed the affair.\\n\\n\"Officer,\" he said, sternly, \"this is an outrage. Why do you not let\\nthat young girl go her way in peace? Why do you molest her?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s my duty to run in every girl who walks the street at night,\\nwithout a justifiable reason.\"\\n\\n\"Let _me_ be responsible for this young woman,\" said the man. \"I\\nbelieve what she told you to be true--that she wants to find a place to\\nstop until day-break, and then she will look for work.\"\\n\\nThe officer recognized the young man at once.\\n\\n\"If _you_ will vouch for her,\" he said, \"why, she can go her way,\\ncertainly.\"\\n\\n\"I think I\\'m a tolerably good judge of character,\" returned the young\\nman, \"and I see nothing in her face to mistrust. Take her to one of the\\nmissions near at hand. She can certainly stay there till morning.\"\\n\\nThe policeman made a low bow, and the young man passed on.\\n\\n\"You have interested one of the richest young men in New York in your\\nbehalf,\" said the policeman, after they had passed on.\\n\\nIda did not ask the name of her benefactor, though she felt deeply\\ngrateful for the kind service he had rendered her.\\n\\nThe matron of the home for friendless girls received the young girl\\nwith the kindliness that characterized her.\\n\\nShe assigned her a little cot, and, wretched and footsore, Ida May\\nthrew herself upon it and sobbed herself to sleep.\\n\\nThe matron looked at her as she passed through the long dormitory on\\nher way to her room.\\n\\n\"She has a sweet face!\" she muttered, as she turned away; \"but one on\\nwhich a tragedy is written.\"\\n\\nIda May was sitting in the reception-room when the matron passed\\nthrough it the next morning, and she asked her if there was anything\\nshe could do for her.\\n\\n\"If you could only tell me, please, where I could find something to\\ndo,\" she answered. \"I must find work, or--starve!\"\\n\\n\"When do you wish to look for a situation?\" asked the matron, noting\\nhow wan and pale the girl looked.\\n\\n\"This day, this very hour!\" cried Ida May, eagerly.\\n\\nThe matron hesitated.\\n\\n\"I must first know what sort of employment you are seeking--what you\\nare best suited for.\"\\n\\n\"I am suited for nothing,\" Ida answered, despondently. \"But that\\nmust not deter me. If one did only the work one was fitted for,\\nthree-quarters of the world would be idle.\"\\n\\n\"Would you take a situation as governess if one could be found for you?\"\\n\\nShe shook her head dejectedly.\\n\\n\"I have not education enough,\" she replied. \"I did not have much\\nopportunity of going to school when I was a little girl, and I am\\nsuffering for it now.\"\\n\\nAfter a moment\\'s pause the matron said, thoughtfully:\\n\\n\"Would you like to try dress-making?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s another thing that I know nothing about,\" she said. \"I was\\nnever taught to mend or sew. I always got out of it. Mother did it for\\nme rather than scold me.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps you would take a position as lady\\'s-maid.\"\\n\\nA gasp, a shiver passed over her. Quick as lightning there flashed\\nbefore her mind the humiliation of three or four maids who had\\naccompanied their mistresses to the Ocean Hotel, at Newport, and how\\nLily Ryder and Hildegarde Cramer had turned up their noses at them\\nbecause they had pretty faces, and had dared to pin in a pretty ribbon\\nor two in the lace caps they were forced to wear on all occasions.\\n\\n\"I am afraid I wouldn\\'t be a success at that,\" she declared.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t suppose you would like to be a house-maid,\" suggested the\\nmatron, looking at the small white hands that lay in the girl\\'s\\nlap--the blue-veined hands that were never designed to scour kettles or\\nclean floors. \"My dear child,\" said the matron, compassionately, \"there\\nis little else in a great city to do.\"\\n\\nThere was a pause--a pause broken presently by Ida May.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you think that if I could get into one of those large stores,\\nI could try on cloaks and hats without requiring any great amount of\\nknowledge of any kind?\"\\n\\nThe matron looked doubtful.\\n\\n\"It is not as easy as you may imagine, my dear, to obtain admission\\ninto any of those large stores. They have any amount of girls on their\\nbooks who are waiting eagerly for positions--persons with whom they\\nare acquainted--and they would stand a better chance than a stranger.\\nBesides, I hardly think a situation in a place of that kind would be\\nsuitable for one so young. We will look over the paper and read the\\nadvertisements.\"\\n\\nShe touched a bell, and told the attendant who answered it to bring in\\nthe morning paper.\\n\\n\"You can look over it, my child,\" said the matron. \"I will return in\\nhalf an hour. By that time you will perhaps have found something that\\nwill suit you.\"\\n\\nLeft alone, Ida May commenced to look through the \"Want\" columns.\\n\\nAll through sixteen columns of the paper the girl\\'s eyes eagerly ran.\\nShe did not find anything that she was competent to do, and tears of\\nvexation rolled down her cheeks.\\n\\nSuddenly her eyes rested upon an advertisement which she must have\\nmissed in her hurried examination of the column.\\n\\n\"Wanted.--A few more hands in a cotton-mill. No. -- Canal Street.\\nApplicants must apply between the hours of nine and ten, this A. M.\"\\n\\nLittle dreaming of what was to come of it, Ida May concluded that this\\nwas certainly the only position she could dare apply for.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI.\\n\\n\\nThe matron entered presently, and Ida May showed her the advertisement\\nthat had attracted her attention.\\n\\n\"It might be as well to try that,\" said the matron, encouragingly.\\n\\nShe looked after the girl as she went slowly down the steps, and shook\\nher head sadly.\\n\\nAs usual, Ida May\\'s lovely face attracted the envy of all the girls\\nin the mill. The foreman, as well as the clerks in the office, admired\\nher, and that was enough to make the girls detest her.\\n\\nIda had secured lodgings in a boarding-house where a score of the girls\\nstopped. She shared her room with Emily Downs, a very quiet little\\nthing, who had been a general favorite with the girls up to this time.\\n\\nMatters were going from bad to worse in the mill. The girls gathered\\ntogether in little groups here and there, and looked darkly at Ida May.\\nEven those who were wont to say \"good-night\" or \"good-morning\" passed\\nher by without a word.\\n\\nThe comments of the jealous girls became louder and deeper as another\\nfortnight dragged its slow lengths by. Whether Ida May heard or heeded\\nthem, they did not care to know. The beautiful face grew whiter still,\\nand the large dark eyes became more pitiful in their pathetic terror.\\n\\nThe girls gathered together one noon hour, and held a long and excited\\nconversation.\\n\\nIda and Emily Downs were eating their luncheon at the further end of\\nthe room, quite apart by themselves. Emily could see that something of\\nan unusual order was transpiring, by the girl\\'s fierce gesticulations\\nand the angry glances that were cast upon her companion, who seemed\\noblivious to it all.\\n\\nAt length one of them called Emily to them. There was a whispered\\nconversation, and looking mechanically across the table at that moment,\\nIda May saw Emily start back with a cry of horror.\\n\\n\"They are talking about me,\" thought Ida, crushing back a sob. \"They\\nwant to turn the only friend I have from me.\"\\n\\nShe finished her simple luncheon in silence. It was scarcely concluded\\nere she noticed with wonder that the girls had formed a group and were\\nmarching over in her direction in a body. There were fully fifty of\\nthem, and Ida noticed with wonder that the face of every one of them\\nwas white, set, and stern.\\n\\n\"Ida May,\" said the ringleader, harshly, \"we have something to say to\\nyou!\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" she answered, thinking that they had reconsidered the matter,\\nand were going to ask her to join them.\\n\\nFor a moment the girl seemed at a loss to know what to say, but the\\nangry murmurs of her companions in the rear nerved her to her task.\\n\\n\"After consultation, we have concluded that, as respectable girls, we\\ncan not remain in the mills another day if you are allowed to work\\nhere. You must leave at once, or we shall do so.\"\\n\\nFor an instant Ida May was fairly dazed. She scarcely believed that she\\nhad heard aright--surely her senses were playing her false. She sprung\\nto her feet, and confronted the girls, who stood, with angered faces,\\nlooking at her.\\n\\n\"Surely you can not mean what you say!\" she gasped. \"What have I done\\nthat you should say this to me?\"\\n\\nThe ringleader looked at her with withering scorn.\\n\\n\"We do not consider you a proper companion to mingle among us,\"\\nreturned the girl, stolidly. \"We all work for our living in this\\ncotton-mill, but if we _are_ poor we are _honest_. Is that plain enough\\nfor you to understand? If not, I will add this\"--and stepping up to\\nthe trembling girl\\'s side, she whispered a few sharp words in her\\near--words that made Ida May recoil as though they had been thrusts of\\na knife that cut to her heart.\\n\\nWith a piteous cry she sunk on her knees, covering her death-white face\\nwith her trembling hands.\\n\\n\"It remains with you to deny or affirm our accusation,\" went on the\\ngirl, harshly \"What have you to say to our charge, Ida May; is it true\\nor false?\"\\n\\nThere was no answer, save the heartrending sobs of the girl cowering\\nbefore them in such abject misery--surely the most pitiful a human\\nheart ever knew.\\n\\n\"You see she _can not_ deny it,\" cried the ringleader, turning\\ntriumphantly to her companions. \"I assured you all that I was certain\\nbefore I advised this step. We may well look upon her with scorn; she\\nis not worthy to breathe the same air with us!\"\\n\\nIda May rose slowly to her feet.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII.\\n\\n\\nHalf fainting with grief and pain, Ida May rushed out into the street.\\n\\nThe sun was shining bright and warm, but it seemed to the girl that the\\nwhole earth was dark and gloomy.\\n\\nWhere should she go? Which way should she turn? She would not go back\\nto the little lodging-house for her few belongings; she never wanted to\\nsee it again. Let them do what they would with her few belongings. The\\nfew dollars that were hers, she happened to have in the pocket of her\\ndress.\\n\\n\"Royal!\" she murmured, \"I can not go to you in this hour of my deepest\\nwoe!\"\\n\\nShe drew her veil down over her face, and the passers-by did not see\\nthe tears that rolled like rain down her white, despairing face. It\\nmattered little to her which way she went.\\n\\nSuddenly she heard the sound of a voice just ahead of her--a voice that\\nsent a thrill to her heart.\\n\\n\"Heaven pity me!\" she gasped; \"it is Royal Ainsley!\"\\n\\nHe was bidding good-bye to a companion on the corner.\\n\\nThe next moment he had boarded a street car. With a smothered cry, Ida\\nMay sprung after him. She must see him, she must speak to him!\\n\\nThe car was crowded. He was in the front of the car and she was at the\\nrear. There was no way of speaking to him. She must ride in the car as\\nfar as he did, and when he alighted she must follow him. As she watched\\nhim with strained eyes, she saw him greet a young and lovely girl.\\n\\nThe sight made the blood turn cold in her veins: Light, airy, gay as of\\nyore he was, all unconscious of the misery he had brought to a human\\nheart. He had wrecked her life. How could he stand there smiling into\\nthe face of another girl?\\n\\nIda\\'s heart swelled with bitter anguish.\\n\\nShe saw the young girl alight from the car at the corner of a\\nfashionable street, and Royal Ainsley accompanied her. He took her arm\\nand bent lovingly over her. She was some rich man\\'s daughter. Ida May,\\nwho followed in their footsteps, was sure of that.\\n\\nThey entered a handsome brown-stone house midway up the street. The\\nveiled, dark-robed little figure passed on, and stood at the end of the\\nstreet until he should reappear. Scores of pedestrians passed as the\\nhours rolled on.\\n\\nUp and down past the house she paced under cover of the darkness. As\\nshe paced slowly to the other end of the street, a coach stopped before\\nthe house she was so intently watching.\\n\\nBefore she could reach a place where she could get a full view, Royal\\nAinsley, with one or two others--she could not tell whether they were\\nmen or women--ran lightly down the steps and entered the vehicle, which\\nrolled rapidly away.\\n\\n\"I have missed him!\" sobbed Ida May. \"God help me!\"\\n\\nOn the morrow, Ida May was so ill that she could not leave the little\\nroom to which she had come for temporary shelter.\\n\\nThe woman who kept the place took a great interest in her.\\n\\nBut every night, as soon as dusk had fallen, Ida May took up her lonely\\nvigil before the house Royal Ainsley had visited.\\n\\nIn her anxiety she did not notice that she had been observed from\\nan upper window by the mistress of the mansion. One night she found\\nherself suddenly confronted by that lady.\\n\\n\"What are you doing here?\" she asked, grasping her by the shoulder.\\n\"Speak at once!\"\\n\\nFor a moment Ida May was so taken aback that she could not utter a\\nsound.\\n\\n\"Answer me at once, or I will have you arrested!\" repeated the lady.\\n\\nIda May hung down her head.\\n\\n\"I must and will know!\" cried the lady, pitilessly. \"Are you watching\\nfor the butler or any of the servants?\"\\n\\nThe young girl lifted her head as proudly as any young queen might have\\ndone. She remembered those weeks at Newport, during which she had been\\nconsidered the equal of the wealthiest girl there.\\n\\n\"No, madame!\" she answered, sharply, \"I was not waiting for any of your\\nservants to appear, but for one of your guests.\"\\n\\nThe lady gave a little gasp; but in an instant she recovered herself.\\n\\n\"A guest!\" she repeated. \"Of whom are you speaking?\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Royal Ainsley,\" replied Ida May, gasping the words out brokenly,\\nthe tears falling like rain down her face.\\n\\n\"Come inside,\" said the lady, drawing her hurriedly into the hall-way,\\nlest she should create a scene. \"Now,\" she said, standing before the\\ngirl with folded arms, \"let me hear all about the matter. You must\\nspeak the truth, or I will certainly force it from you.\"\\n\\n\"It would illy become me to speak anything but the truth,\" responded\\nIda May. \"Royal Ainsley comes here to see some beautiful young girl who\\nlives in this house. But this must not be. He is mine--mine--by every\\ntie that binds man to woman!\"\\n\\n\"Surely he is not your--your--husband?\" exclaimed the lady, excitedly.\\n\\n\"He--he should have been,\" sobbed Ida May, in a quivering voice. \"It\\nwas all a mistake, a terrible mistake,\" she continued, wringing her\\nhands.\\n\\nThe lady, who did not know her story, mistook her.\\n\\nWhen she told her she started back in wonder.\\n\\nQuick as thought she had decided upon her course of action.\\n\\n\"I wish to make an appointment with you,\" she said, \"to talk over this\\nmatter. Can you come here to-morrow?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Ida May. \"I shall be too busy. I have some work from one of\\nthe stores, that will keep me engaged.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps I can assist you so that it will not be necessary for you to\\nwork so hard. Still, if to-morrow is inconvenient, come in the evening.\"\\n\\nShe was about to add, \"I pity you;\" but there was something in the\\ngirl\\'s face that forbid her pity.\\n\\nThe lady watched her curiously until she was out of sight. Then, with\\na sigh of relief, she walked slowly up the grand staircase to her\\n_boudoir_.\\n\\nA young and lovely girl was reclining on a couch, turning over the\\nleaves of a photograph album.\\n\\n\"Well, did you find out what is the matter with the girl?\" she asked.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said the elder woman. \"And you would never guess what it was.\"\\n\\n\"Pardon me; but I shall not even try,\" said the young girl, indolently,\\n\"for the simple reason that it would be too much of an effort for me.\"\\n\\n\"I will tell you,\" said the lady, drawing up a chair; \"and I want you\\nto pay the strictest attention, Florence St. John.\"\\n\\n\"The subject will not interest me, mamma,\" returned the young girl,\\nturning over the leaves.\\n\\n\"But it _will_ interest you,\" returned the other, \"when I tell you that\\nit concerns your new handsome lover.\"\\n\\nShe was quite right. The album fell to the floor with a crash.\\n\\n\"It appears,\" said Mrs. St. John, \"that young Ainsley has got into some\\nkind of an intrigue with a poor but very pretty shop-girl. I think she\\nmust be a shop-girl.\"\\n\\n\"I shall write to him at once never to cross this threshold again!\"\\ncried the young girl, indignantly.\\n\\n\"You will do nothing of the kind,\" replied her mother. \"Sit down and\\nlisten to me. All young men are wild, and you must not take a man to\\ntask for what he has done before he knew you. Shut your eyes to it, and\\nnever bring it up to him. That\\'s always safest. If he thinks you _do_\\nknow about his past life, he will be reckless, and think he doesn\\'t\\nneed to care.\"\\n\\n\"About this girl, mamma--who is she?\" she asked.\\n\\n\"A very pretty young creature,\" was the reply.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII.\\n\\n\\nFaint and heart-sick, Ida May crept down the broad stone steps of the\\nelegant mansion, and wended her way back to her humble lodgings. Just\\nas she was about to touch the bell, a man ran hastily up the steps.\\n\\n\"Well, well, I declare!\" he exclaimed, \"I am at the wrong house. But in\\nthis confounded tenement row, one house is so like the other that one\\ncan not help making a mistake now and then.\"\\n\\nWith a gasp, Ida May reeled backward. At the very first word he had\\nuttered, Ida May had recognized Royal Ainsley.\\n\\nIt was Frank Garrick, the manager of the telegraph office.\\n\\nThe sentence had scarcely left his lips ere he recognized her.\\n\\n\"Aha!\" he cried, a fierce imprecation accompanying the words. \"So it\\'s\\n_you_, Ida May?\" he added, catching her fiercely by the cloak. \"So I\\nhave found you at last!\"\\n\\nShe was too frightened to reply.\\n\\n\"So this is where you are stopping, is it? Come, walk as far as the end\\nof the street with me. I want to talk to you.\"\\n\\n\"No!\" cried Ida May, struggling to free herself from his grasp. \"I have\\nnothing to say to you, nor will I listen to you!\"\\n\\n\"We shall see about that presently,\" he cried. \"Frank Garrick is not a\\nman to be balked in this way by a little girl. You _shall_ listen to\\nme!\"\\n\\nIda May reached out her hand quickly to touch the bell, but he\\nanticipated the movement, and caught her arm roughly.\\n\\nShe tried to cry out, but no sound issued from her lips.\\n\\nShe had already gone through more than her overstrained nerves could\\nbear. Without a cry or a moan, she sunk in a dead faint at his feet.\\n\\nGathering her up in his arms, Frank Garrick sprung quickly down the\\nsteps. For a moment he stood there with his helpless burden in his arms.\\n\\n\"This is quite an unexpected go,\" he muttered, standing there undecided\\nfor a moment. \"I must leave her here a moment, that is certain, while I\\nrun for a man\\'s voice.\"\\n\\nHe placed Ida on the the lower step, in a sitting position, and darted\\ndown the street in the direction of a cab-stand.\\n\\nHe did not see the open window of an adjoining house, because of the\\nclosed blind which protected it, nor the crouching form of the woman\\nbehind it, who had heard and witnessed all.\\n\\nLike a flash she caught up her hat, which was lying on an adjacent\\ntable, and sprung out of the door.\\n\\n\"I knew he would come to see her at last!\" she said, fairly hissing\\nthe words. \"They have had a quarrel. That is why he has stayed away so\\nlong. He has gone after a cab to take her elsewhere. But I will block\\nhis little game!\" cried Nannie Rogers--for it was she. \"I shall take a\\nterrible revenge upon him by striking him through her.\"\\n\\nTaking a short cut to a nearer cab-stand, she hailed the first vehicle.\\nThe man sprung down from his box.\\n\\n\"Why, is that you, Nannie?\" he cried, in unfeigned surprise.\\n\\n\"Yes, Joe,\" she answered, quickly. \"I want your cab for a while.\"\\n\\nIn a few words she told him of a woman lying on the steps of the house\\nnext to her--a woman whom she wished to befriend.\\n\\n\"I want you to take her to a certain place. I will tell you about it\\nwhen we start. Come quickly and help me to get her into your cab.\"\\n\\nThis was accomplished in less time than it takes to tell it.\\n\\n\"Where to, Nannie?\" asked the driver, as he picked up the reins.\\n\\n\"Why in the world are you taking her there?\" he exclaimed in dismay.\\n\\n\"Make no comments,\" she replied, angrily: \"but drive on as fast as you\\ncan. I wouldn\\'t take her there unless it was all right.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, of course,\" returned the driver. \"I am not saying but that you\\nknow what you\\'re doing. But she seems mighty quiet for that kind of a\\nperson.\"\\n\\nThey had scarcely turned the first corner ere Frank Garrick drove up in\\na cab.\\n\\n\"By thunder! she has vanished!\" he exclaimed, excitedly, looking in\\nastonishment at the spot where he had left her a short time before.\\n\"She must have fled into the house,\" he muttered. \"Well, cabby, here\\'s\\nyour fee, anyhow. You may as well go back.\"\\n\\nFor some moments Frank Garrick stood quite still and looked up at the\\nhouse.\\n\\n\"Of all places in the world, who would have expected to find her\\nhere--next door to Nannie. It\\'s certain that Nannie does not know\\nof it. She could not keep it if she did. Well, this is a pretty\\nhowdy-do--two rivals living next door to each other. Nannie is\\nexpecting me to call on her this evening. If it were not for that, I\\nwouldn\\'t show up at all, I\\'m so upset by that little beauty, Ida May.\"\\n\\nVery slowly he walked up the steps of the adjoining house and pulled\\nthe bell. To his great surprise, he learned that Nannie was out.\\n\\n\"She will be sure to be back presently,\" added the girl who answered\\nthe bell. \"Won\\'t you come in and wait?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" he answered, glad of the excuse. \"I\\'ll run in some evening during\\nthe week.\"\\n\\nWith that he turned on his heel and walked rapidly away.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the carriage bearing Nannie Rogers and the still unconscious\\nIda May rolled quickly onward, and stopped at length before a red-brick\\nbuilding on the outskirts of the city.\\n\\nIda May\\'s swoon lasted so long that even Nannie grew frightened.\\n\\n\"Wait,\" she said to the driver, \"I will have to step in first and see\\nif they will receive her.\"\\n\\nAfter fully five minutes had elapsed, the door opened and a tall man\\nlooked out.\\n\\n\"It is I, doctor,\" said Nannie Rogers. \"May I step inside? I want to\\nspeak to you. I have a patient waiting outside the gate.\"\\n\\n\"Dear me! is it really you? You come at rather a late hour. Still, you\\nknow you are a priviliged person here.\"\\n\\n\"I ought to be, since I have learned so many secrets about the place\\nand yourself,\" she said, \"when I was nurse here.\"\\n\\n\"Didn\\'t I give you five hundred dollars to insure secrecy when you left\\nhere?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I kept my promise. I never told anything, did I?\"\\n\\n\"Let me understand what you want,\" he said, abruptly. \"Did I understand\\nyou to say that there was a patient outside?\"\\n\\nThe girl nodded.\\n\\n\"It does not matter who or what she is,\" she said, tersely. \"It is the\\ndesire of her friends that she be kept here for a few months. I suppose\\nyou are anxious to know about the pay?\"\\n\\n\"Of course. That\\'s where my interest comes in,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Well, I will be responsible for it,\" she said.\\n\\n\"You?\" he said, amazedly.\\n\\n\"Yes; why not?\" she returned.\\n\\nHe looked at her with something like doubt.\\n\\n\"You dare not refuse to accept her!\" she declared.\\n\\n\"Do you mean that for a threat?\" he exclaimed, fiercely.\\n\\nShe shrugged her shoulders.\\n\\n\"I can not be held accountable for the way in which you take my\\nassertion,\" she declared.\\n\\nThe frown deepened on the man\\'s face.\\n\\n\"For convenience\\'s sake, we will say that the girl is an opium-eater,\\nand that is why you are keeping her under such strict surveillance.\"\\n\\nThe man muttered some strange, unintelligible remark.\\n\\n\"I suppose the cabman will help me in with the girl?\" he said, harshly.\\n\\n\"Of course,\" replied Nannie Rogers, impatiently.\\n\\nThe girl\\'s figure was so light that \"the doctor,\" as he termed himself,\\nfound little difficulty in bringing her into the house without aid.\\n\\nNannie Rogers stood in the hall-way, and followed him into the\\nreception room, where he laid the girl down upon a rude couch. She\\nwatched him as he threw back her long dark veil, and cried out in\\nwonder at the marvelous beauty of the still white face--the face so\\nlike chiseled marble.\\n\\n\"How young and how very lovely!\" he remarked; and as he spoke, he\\nunfolded the long dark cloak that enveloped her.\\n\\nA sharp exclamation broke from his lips, and he turned around suddenly.\\n\\n\"Nannie Rogers!\" he said.\\n\\nBut the look of astonishment that he saw on her face was as great as\\nhis own bore. Nannie Rogers\\' look of astonishment quickly gave way to\\none of the most intense hatred; ay, a very demon of rage seemed to have\\ntaken possession of her.\\n\\n\"I wonder that you brought her here,\" said the doctor.\\n\\nBut Nannie Rogers was speechless. She was gazing like one turned to\\nstone upon the face of the girl whom she believed to be her rival.\\n\\n\"I have a double reason for hating her now,\" she said, under her\\nbreath, clinching her hands so tightly that her nails cut deep into her\\npalms. But she did not even feel the pain.\\n\\n\"I say, I wonder that you brought her here,\" repeated the doctor.\\n\\n\"I knew of no better place,\" she replied, turning her eyes uneasily\\naway from him. \"You must not refuse to receive her.\"\\n\\n\"Who is she?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"I refuse to answer your question,\" she replied, grimly. \"You know only\\nthis about her: She is a confirmed opium-eater. One who is very much\\ninterested in her brought her here to be treated by you. She is to be\\nkept here, under strict watch, to prevent her getting away. If she\\nwrites any letters they are to be forwarded to me.\"\\n\\nAnd thus it happened that when Ida May opened her troubled eyes, after\\nthe doctor and an attendant had worked over her for upward of an hour,\\nshe found herself in a strange room, with strange faces bending over\\nher. She looked blankly up at them.\\n\\n\"The waves are very high,\" she moaned. \"Come back on the beach, girls,\"\\nshe murmured.\\n\\n\"She is out of her head,\" exclaimed the doctor, turning nervously to\\nhis attendant. \"I ought not to have taken this girl in,\" he continued,\\nin alarm. \"I fear we shall have no end of trouble with her. This looks\\nlike a long and lingering illness.\"\\n\\n\"She is so young, and as fair as a flower,\" murmured the attendant,\\nbending over her. \"I feel very sorry for her. If a fever should happen\\nto set in, do you think it would prove fatal to her?\" she asked,\\neagerly.\\n\\n\"In nine cases out of ten--yes,\" he replied, brusquely.\\n\\nAt the very hour that this conversation was taking place, Royal\\nAinsley, the scape-grace, was ascending the brown-stone steps of the\\nSt. John mansion.\\n\\n\"I will take beautiful Florence and her stately mamma to the ball\\nto-night,\" he mused, under his breath. \"Before we return, I will have\\nproposed to the haughty beauty. Trust me for that. They think I am\\nthe heir of my uncle, wealthy old Royal Ainsley, who died recently,\\nand--curse him!--left all his wealth to my gentlemanly cousin, even\\nmaking him change his name to that of Eugene Mallard, that the outside\\nworld might not confound it with mine. Yes, I will marry beautiful\\nFlorence St. John, and live a life of luxury!\"\\n\\nIn that moment there rose before his mental vision the sweet sad face\\nof beautiful Ida May, the fair young girl whom he had wronged so\\ncruelly and then deserted so heartlessly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIX.\\n\\n\\nThe servant who answered the bell at that moment, put a stop to Royal\\nAinsley\\'s musings.\\n\\nHe had only a few moments to wait in the drawing-room before Miss St.\\nJohn appeared.\\n\\nShe looked so lovely in her beautiful ball-dress that his eyes glowed\\nand his heart beat. Before he had an opportunity to utter the words\\nthat were on his lips, the young girl\\'s mother entered the drawing-room.\\n\\nShe was so gay and bright with him, that the mother wondered vaguely if\\nshe had forgotten the story which she had told concerning him.\\n\\nThe warning glance which she gave her daughter reminded her that she\\nmust act decorously.\\n\\nThe girl was very much in love, and it was easy enough for her to\\nforgive him for having had another sweetheart.\\n\\nHe accompanied mother and daughter to the grand ball. He was so gay and\\nso brilliant and so witty, that he charmed the beautiful Miss St. John\\nmore than ever, and he knew by her smiles that his efforts were not in\\nvain.\\n\\nAinsley was the very poetry of motion. It was a dream of delight to\\nFlorence St. John, as they made the round of the magnificent ball-room,\\nwith his arms clasped about her, his handsome face so near her own.\\n\\n\"Come into the conservatory, Florence,\" he whispered; \"I have something\\nto tell you.\"\\n\\nHow strange it was the scene and the occasion did not cause him to\\nremember that _other_ scene and that _other_ girl whom he had once\\nbrought into the conservatory to listen to words of burning love!\\n\\n\"Florence,\" he whispered, \"I have something to tell you. Will you\\nlisten to me?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" she said, her heart beating furiously, for, woman-like, she knew\\nwhat was coming. The lovely color on her cheeks deepened, the girl\\'s\\nblue eyes grew luminous and tender.\\n\\n\"Florence,\" he cried, \"how shall I tell you what I have to say? Oh,\\nFlorence, let me tell it quickly, lest my courage fail! I love you,\\ndear--love you as I have never loved any one in my life before!\"\\n\\nLooking into the dark, handsome face of the young man before her,\\nFlorence St. John saw that she was in the presence of a mighty\\npassion--a great love.\\n\\nIn an instant he was kneeling by her side, his whole soul in his eyes\\nand on his lips. It was the very first time in his life that Royal\\nAinsley\\'s heart was ever stirred with love.\\n\\nIf Florence St. John had even been poor, he would have cared for her.\\nHe started in first by wanting the girl for her money; it ended by his\\nwanting her for herself.\\n\\nHe caught the little hand in his that was carrying the beautiful\\nbouquet of roses he had sent her, and held it tightly.\\n\\n\"Thank Heaven!\" he said, \"the time has come at last, my beautiful love,\\nfor which I have waited so long. Surely you know what I have to tell\\nyou, Florence!\" he said, drawing back and looking at her.\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t the least idea,\" declared the girl, in whom the spirit of\\ncoquetry was strong. \"Really, I do not understand.\"\\n\\n\"There needs be no understanding, my beautiful love!\" he cried. \"None!\\nI have come to tell you in words what I have already told you a hundred\\ntimes in a hundred different ways--I love you with all my heart! I love\\nyou! I know no other words. There is none which can tell how dearly or\\nhow much all my heart, my soul, my life goes out in those few words--I\\nlove you!\"\\n\\nHis voice died away in a whisper.\\n\\n\"I have a true and serious friendship for you, Mr. Ainsley,\" she\\nanswered, coyly; \"but I--I have never thought of such a thing as love\\nor marriage.\"\\n\\n\"Will you think of it _now_?\" he answered, eagerly.\\n\\nHe loved her all the more for this sweet, womanly, modest hesitation.\\n\\nShe arose from the seat near the fountain where he had placed her.\\n\\n\"Well, let it rest in that way,\" she answered. \"I\\'ll refer the subject\\nto mamma; but you are not to say one word of love to me, nor speak to\\nher about the matter for at least two months.\"\\n\\n\"Florence, you are cruel,\" he cried, \"to keep me so long in suspense.\\nTell me, at least, that if your mother favors my suit, I may hope that\\nyou are not indifferent to me.\"\\n\\nBut she would not answer him. Her heart beat high, the fever of love\\nthrobbed in her veins; but, like all well-bred young girls, she had\\nbeen schooled by early training to make no sign of preference for\\nany man at his first avowal of affection. As he led her from the\\nconservatory, past the fountain, the fragrant water-lilies, past the\\ngreen palms and the flowering orchids, he gave a terrible start.\\n\\nIn that moment there came to him the memory of Ida May. He was annoyed\\nby the very thought of her in that hour, and he quickly put it from him.\\n\\nWhen they returned to the ball-room, Florence was as sweet as ever; but\\nneither by word or by sign did she betray any rememberance of the scene\\nwhich had just occurred in the conservatory.\\n\\nHe left Florence and her mother at the door of their home an hour\\nlater, but he did not have the opportunity of holding the little white\\nhand in his for one moment, or of holding even a word of conversation\\nwith her.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Mrs. St. John, when she and her daughter found themselves\\nalone for a moment, \"I saw him take you to the conservatory. You were\\ngone a long time. Did he propose?\"\\n\\n\"Yes!\" returned the girl, languidly.\\n\\n\"Yes!\" echoed Mrs. St. John. \"Why, how can you take it so calmly, my\\nFlorence? You accepted him, of course?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" returned the girl, calmly. \"I said that I would like to have two\\nmonths to consider the matter before the subject was broached to you.\"\\n\\n\"You are mad, Florence!\" cried her mother. \"A wealthy young man like\\nthat is not captured every day.\"\\n\\n\"We are not so poor, mamma, that I should make a god of wealth,\" said\\nthe girl.\\n\\n\"Oh, certainly not,\" said her mother; \"but I have always been afraid\\nyou would be sought after by some fortune-hunter.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XX.\\n\\n\\n\"I am sorry,\" said Mrs. St. John, after a moment\\'s pause, \"that you\\nhave refused to consider his suit for at least two months. Eligible\\nyoung men are not so plentiful nowadays that a young girl can be so\\nindependent.\"\\n\\n\"I need not ask _you_ what your opinion of an eligible young man is,\"\\nsaid the young girl, throwing back her head haughtily, \"for I know\\nyou would answer--a large bank account. But in _my_ opinion that does\\nnot constitute all, where the happiness of a life-time is at stake. I\\nwould rather marry a man whose reputation was spotless, if he did not\\nhave a second coat to his back. There is something more than money in\\nthis world to make our happiness. I am _glad_ instead of sorry that I\\nrefused to give him an answer for two months. I shall demand to know\\nwho the young girl is who came to our door, and what she is to him.\"\\n\\n\"Then you will be doing a very unwise thing,\" declared her mother,\\nemphatically. \"Let well enough alone. I told the girl to call around\\nto-morrow night, and when she comes I will have a talk with her.\"\\n\\n\"Will you permit me to be present at the interview, mamma?\"\\n\\n\"By no means!\" exclaimed Mrs. St. John, with asperity. \"The story that\\nno doubt will be unfolded to me is not for ears such as yours. I will\\ntell as much to you as I deem necessary for you to know; let that\\nsuffice.\"\\n\\nBut the young beauty and heiress was not to be appeased. She made up\\nher mind to see the girl at all hazards when she should come; but much\\nto the surprise of both mother and daughter, the girl did not put in an\\nappearance.\\n\\nThat day passed, as did also the next and the next. A week went by and\\nlengthened into a fortnight, and still the girl came not.\\n\\n\"You see, my dear, her statement was false!\" cried Mrs. St. John,\\ntriumphantly. \"She feared that we would investigate her story, and\\nshe was no doubt a fraud. If you believe all those strange stories\\nyou hear, you will have enough to do. She was no doubt looking for\\nhush-money, and when I did not offer to give it to her, you see she did\\nnot return.\"\\n\\nThis seemed quite the truth, as Florence saw it.\\n\\nHow wrong it had been to even suspect him! She made up her mind that if\\nhe should broach the subject before the time she had named, she might\\nnot refuse his pleading.\\n\\nShe was expecting him that very evening. He came at last, looking so\\nhandsome, so buoyant, that the girl\\'s heart went out to him at once,\\nas the hearts of so many women had done.\\n\\nHe brought her some beautiful violets, and he knew he had as good as\\nwon her when he saw her fasten them in the bodice of her dress.\\n\\nFlorence St. John was sitting in a velvet arm-chair but a short\\ndistance away. Her beautiful face was softened, more so than he had\\never seen it before, the smile on her lips was sweeter--the proud,\\nhalf-defiant, flashing loveliness seemed all at once to grow gentle.\\n\\nHe no longer seemed quite sure of her. It was Florence St. John\\'s\\nsilence that alarmed him, perhaps.\\n\\n\"I wish,\" he cried, \"that I knew in what words and in what fashion\\nother men make love.\"\\n\\n\"Does not your own heart teach you?\" asked the young girl, suddenly.\\n\\nHis face flushed at the question.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he answered; \"but I am not sure that the teachings are of the\\nright kind. You have not answered me, and it must be _my_ fault, either\\nbecause I have not expressed myself properly or that I have not made\\nmyself understood. Florence, I want you--with my whole heart I ask\\nyou--I want you to become my wife.\"\\n\\n\"Am I the first person you have ever told this to?\" she asked, slowly,\\nlooking him in the face.\\n\\nAlmost every girl he had ever made love to had asked him the same\\nquestion, and he was not abashed by it.\\n\\nThe ever-ready answer was on his lips instantly.\\n\\n\"How could you ever believe that I had spoken one word of love to any\\none but yourself,\" he said, reproachfully. \"No other face has ever had\\nthe slightest attraction for me. The men of my race have but one love\\nin a life-time. I have never loved before I met you. I shall love you\\nuntil I die. Are you answered?\"\\n\\nHe looked straight into her face as he uttered the falsehood.\\n\\nThere did sweep across his mind, as he uttered the falsehood, the\\nmemory of Ida May; but he put it from him quickly.\\n\\nHow strange it was that her memory should always haunt him, try hard as\\nhe would to banish it!\\n\\n\"You are quite sure that you never loved any girl but me?\" she repeated.\\n\\n\"_Quite_ sure,\" he responded. \"To doubt me causes me great pain,\\nFlorence.\"\\n\\n\"Then forget that I asked the question,\" she said, sweetly, believing\\nin him implicitly.\\n\\n\"And you will be mine?\" he whispered, holding the little hand closer.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" she answered, solemnly.\\n\\nHe caught her in his arms in a transport of delight.\\n\\n\"Thank you--thank you for those words, Ida!\" he cried.\\n\\n\"Did I understand you to call me _Ida_?\" she asked in wonder.\\n\\n\"No,\" he answered, boldly, cursing himself for the slip of the tongue.\\n\"I was about to add: \\'I do so thank you,\\' but you did not give me an\\nopportunity to finish the sentence.\"\\n\\nThe falsehood was so adroitly told that she believed him.\\n\\n\"I shall have to put a curb on my tongue, or Heaven knows what name I\\nshall be saying next.\"\\n\\nShould she tell him of the young girl who was at the door waiting to\\nsee him? She remembered her mother\\'s words the next moment, to say\\nnothing of the matter.\\n\\n\"Now that you have been so good as to consent to marry me, we are to\\nconsider ourselves engaged. The question is, when will you marry me? It\\nmay as well be _soon_ as late.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I really don\\'t know about that now,\" she declared.\\n\\n\"Make me happy by saying that it will be as soon as possible,\" he urged.\\n\\nThere was no denying anything he asked in that winsome voice.\\n\\n\"I promise,\" she repeated, after another pause.\\n\\nHe caught her in his arms and strained her to his bosom.\\n\\n\"You have made me the happiest man in the whole wide world, Florence!\"\\nhe cried, rapturously.\\n\\nSuddenly his arms fell from her and he reeled backward, staring at the\\nwindow with widely dilated eyes.\\n\\n\"What is the matter, Royal? Are you ill?\" cried Florence, in the\\ngreatest terror.\\n\\n\"Some one passed along the porch just outside the window,\" he\\npanted--\"a woman hurrying toward the vestibule door. She will ring the\\nbell in a moment!\" he gasped.\\n\\nAt that instant there was a heavy peal at the front door bell.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXI.\\n\\n\\n\"Florence,\" repeated Royal Ainsley, his face white as death, his teeth\\nchattering, \"order the servants not to answer the bell!\"\\n\\nBut it was too late; the door had already swung back on its hinges. An\\ninstant later the servant appeared with a card.\\n\\n\"A gentleman, miss,\" he said. \"I told him you were not at home, as you\\nrequested.\"\\n\\nFlorence St. John held the card in her white fingers.\\n\\n\"You see, it was not a lady,\" she said, half amused at his agitation.\\n\\nHe drew a breath of intense relief.\\n\\n\"Pardon me, Florence,\" he said. \"I--I--thought it was one of your girl\\nfriends who was about to share your attention with me. I gave way to my\\nannoyance. Be kind, and forget it. Remember the old adage: \\'One finds\\nmuch to pardon in a man who is in love.\\'\"\\n\\nHis explanation of the matter satisfied her. Very young girls are\\nnever suspicious. The remembrance of that one evening always stood\\nout bright and clear in Florence St. John\\'s life. She gave herself\\nup to happiness, and when Royal urged her to name an early day, she\\nlaughingly consented.\\n\\n\"All the ladies in our family have been married in April,\" she declared.\\n\\n\"That is almost four months from now, my darling,\" he groaned. \"Do not\\nask me to wait so long. So much might take place within that time!\"\\n\\nHe was about to add \"to part us,\" but stopped himself just in time.\\n\\n\"A lady has to have a _trousseau_ prepared,\" she said, archly. \"And\\nwhen you put yourself in the hands of these _modistes_, you are at\\ntheir mercy; they will not be hurried. Mamma, I am sure, would not\\nconsent to an earlier marriage than that. I hope that I may persuade\\nher to do so.\"\\n\\n\"You will allow me to persuade her differently, if I can?\" he asked,\\neagerly.\\n\\n\"Yes, if you can,\" she answered.\\n\\n\"I will try to settle it before I leave the house this very night,\"\\nhe declared. \"Ah, here comes your mother now! If you will make some\\nkind of an excuse to absent yourself from the room, my darling, for a\\nfew moments, I will urge my suit so eloquently that she will find it\\ndifficult to say \\'no\\' to me.\"\\n\\nMrs. St. John greeted the young man pleasantly as she entered. She was\\ntoo thoroughly a woman of the world to greet him effusively, knowing,\\nhad she done so, it would be sure to make him too confident of success.\\n\\nRoyal Ainsley laid himself out to please the mother as he had never\\nattempted to please an elderly woman before.\\n\\n\"You asked me to play over a new piece of music for you when you\\ncame. If you will please excuse me for a moment, I will get it,\" said\\nFlorence, glancing up shyly at him with laughing eyes, as much as to\\nsay, \"I am going to give you a chance for the longed-for interview with\\nmamma\"--a look which Royal Ainsley answered with a nod. Florence had\\nscarcely reached the upper landing ere Royal Ainsley left his seat, and\\nwalked eagerly over to Mrs. St. John\\'s side.\\n\\n\"My dear lady,\" he began, dropping into a seat opposite her, \"I want\\nto tell you a little story and hear your opinion about it.\"\\n\\nMrs. St. John was wise enough to know what was coming, but she did not\\nbetray more than the usual interest.\\n\\n\"It is the story of a young man who wished to possess a treasure which\\nbelonged to another. He yearned for it with all his soul.\\n\\n\"My dear lady, not to beat further round the bush, let me say I am the\\nyoung man who wishes to possess the treasure which you hold as sacred.\\nThat treasure is your beautiful daughter Florence, my dear lady. I love\\nher with all my heart. I want your consent to make her my wife.\"\\n\\n\"Dear, dear me!\" exclaimed Mrs. St. John, apparently greatly\\nfrustrated. \"I hope you have not spoken a word of this to the dear\\nchild.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I have, and we have both determined to abide by your decision, as\\nto how long we shall have to wait, though we both hope you will set as\\nearly a day as possible.\"\\n\\n\"Remember that my Florence is only a school-girl yet,\" declared the\\nmother. \"I could not think of parting from her yet.\"\\n\\n\"Dear, dear lady!\" cried Royal Ainsley, \"do not doom me to such pitiful\\nsuspense, I beg of you! There are some men who could wait with much\\npatience, but I am not one of them. I should have to go away and travel\\nincessantly.\"\\n\\nThis was exactly what Mrs. St. John did not wish to happen. The gilded\\nyouth before her was too good a catch in the matrimonial market to lose.\\n\\nEvery mother is always glad to have her daughter make a good match. She\\nwas no exception to the rule.\\n\\nAnd when she read in the paper, a few months later, of that uncle\\'s\\ndeath, and that he had left his vast wealth to his nephew, Royal\\nAinsley, she was determined that no effort should be spared to make him\\nfall in love with her daughter.\\n\\nHe grew eloquent in his pleading. Ere ten minutes more had elapsed, he\\nhad drawn from Mrs. St. John\\'s lips the promise that the wedding should\\ntake place in four months\\' time at the very latest.\\n\\nHe made up his mind to accept this decision for the present, but he\\nwould certainly depend upon his own eloquence and persuasive powers in\\nthe near future to overcome her scruples and influence her to name an\\nearlier day.\\n\\nHe left the house that night buoyant of spirits and gay of heart. It\\nwas strange that in that hour he thought of Ida May.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXII.\\n\\n\\nWe must now return to Ida May, dear reader, and the thrilling\\nexperiences the poor girl was passing through in the lonely stone house\\non the river-road.\\n\\nOwing to the drug which was being constantly administered to her, from\\nthe hour she crossed the threshold Ida knew little or nothing of what\\nwas going on in the outside world.\\n\\nThe days lengthened into weeks, and the weeks into months.\\n\\nHer remittances came regularly; still, the \"doctor\" of the sanitarium\\nwas heartily sick of his bargain. He dared not refuse Nannie Rogers\\'\\nrequest to keep her there, for reasons which would put him behind the\\nprison bars had they reached the ears of the authorities.\\n\\nWhen he saw the girl grow whiter and more fragile with each passing\\nday, his alarm increased.\\n\\nIn this horrible place Ida May wore out four long and weary months of\\nher young life.\\n\\nThey had long since ceased giving her the drug. It was unnecessary now\\nto waste any more of it upon her.\\n\\nWhen Ida May\\'s mind slowly cleared, and a realization of what was going\\non about her came to her, she looked in the greatest astonishment at\\nthe strange apartment and the grim-faced woman who was bringing food\\nto her.\\n\\n\"Where am I, and who are you?\" she asked. \"Oh, I remember! I swooned on\\nthe steps of the boarding-house. Did _he_ have me brought here?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" retorted the doctor\\'s sister, thinking that the better way of\\nstopping all questioning.\\n\\nA bitter cry of horror rose to Ida May\\'s lips.\\n\\n\"Then I must go away from here at once!\" she declared, attempting to\\ngain her feet.\\n\\nBut she was so weak that she staggered and would have fallen had not\\nthe woman sprung forward and saved her.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t go on in that way,\" said the woman, brusquely. \"You are to\\nremain here until you are--well. It won\\'t be over a fortnight longer.\\nYou\\'ve been here some time.\"\\n\\n\"But I _will not_ remain here!\" exclaimed Ida May, excitedly. \"I shall\\nleave at once!\"\\n\\nThe woman turned the key in the lock, coolly removed it, and slipping\\nit into her pocket, remarked:\\n\\n\"This is a sanitarium. It is not for patients to say when they shall\\nleave here. _That_ is the doctor\\'s business.\"\\n\\n\"But tell me, why does any one wish to keep me here?\" cried Ida May,\\npiteously. \"No one in the whole world has any interest in me.\"\\n\\n\"I am surprised to hear you say that,\" declared the woman, grimly, with\\nsomething very much like a sneer in her harsh voice.\\n\\nThe words, the tone in which they were uttered, and the look which\\naccompanied them, cut the poor girl to the heart.\\n\\n\"Let me tell you about the man who brought me here,\" cried Ida,\\ntrembling like a leaf, believing it must certainly be her sworn enemy,\\nFrank Garrick, who had taken cruelly taken advantage of her to abduct\\nher when she swooned on the boarding-house stoop.\\n\\n\"I have no time to listen to you,\" exclaimed the woman. \"We are\\nstrictly forbidden to talk to the patients or listen to their tales of\\nwoe, which are always woven out of whole cloth.\"\\n\\n\"You are a woman like myself,\" cried Ida May, sobbing bitterly. \"Surely\\nyou can not find it in your heart to turn a deaf ear to me, for pity\\'s\\nsake, if for nothing else.\"\\n\\nBut the woman was inexorable, and said:\\n\\n\"I tell you, I don\\'t want to hear what you have got to say--and I\\n_won\\'t_, that\\'s all about it. If you make any fuss, you will be put on\\na diet of bread and water.\"\\n\\n\"But answer me this one question,\" said Ida May, in terror. \"What\\nreason has any one in keeping me here against my will?\"\\n\\nThe woman shrugged her shoulders.\\n\\n\"There may be plenty of reasons,\" she retorted, sharply. \"Perhaps you\\nare a wife that some man wants to be rid of. Then, again, perhaps you\\nare no wife--a better reason still for some young man wishing to get\\nyou safely out of his path just now. A father or a brother may have\\nbrought you here to save the family honor. I could go on with any\\namount of practical reasons.\"\\n\\n\"Have I not told you that I am all alone in the world?\" panted the poor\\ngirl, clinging to her with death-cold hands.\\n\\n\"Yes; but I have good reason to think otherwise,\" replied the woman,\\nbluntly. \"There\\'s no use in your making a fuss,\" continued the woman,\\nharshly. \"You may have to put in a long time beneath this roof.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIII.\\n\\n\\nLong hours after the woman left the room, Ida May sat by the window\\nlooking out into the darkness, and trying to fathom what seemed to her\\nthe greatest kind of a mystery.\\n\\nWhy should Frank Garrick take interest enough in her to have her\\nbrought here and to pay money for having her retained here? What\\ninterest could he have in her?\\n\\nHe had vowed a terrible vengeance upon her when she repulsed his offer\\nof love. But why should his vengeance have taken this form? What\\nbenefit could it be to him to shut her in from the world?\\n\\nAs Ida sat there in the waning light, her eyes fell upon a piece of\\nnewspaper in the open fire-place.\\n\\n\"I will wrap up my few belongings in that,\" she muttered, \"and then set\\nabout making my way out of this place.\"\\n\\nAs she smoothed out the half sheet, a few lines midway down one of the\\ncolumns held her spell-bound as they caught her eye.\\n\\nFor a moment she stared at the words. They seemed to fairly turn the\\nheart in her bosom to stone, for they read as follows:\\n\\n \"The engagement is announced of Miss Florence St. John, of No. --,\\n Fifth Avenue, daughter of Mrs. J. St. John, to Mr. Royal Ainsley, of\\n New York. The wedding will take place at Peekskill, on the Hudson, a\\n month from date.\"\\n\\nAs she read it, the room seemed to whirl around her. With a cry so\\npiteous that it seemed it must reach God\\'s ear, the poor girl sunk on\\nher knees.\\n\\nHer husband about to marry another!\\n\\nNo matter what the world might say, she had married him in good faith.\\nHe was hers; he belonged to her before Heaven and all the world.\\n\\nShe wrung her hands wildly.\\n\\n\"The marriage must not take place! I must save the man I love from\\nhimself and the anger of the watching angels!\" she cried.\\n\\nShe prayed wildly that she might not be too late.\\n\\nHer hat and cloak were hanging on a peg near the door. She took them\\ndown, and her hands trembled so that she could hardly put them on. Her\\nknees trembled, and she felt faint. But she summoned all her strength,\\nand reached the door and turned the knob. But it was locked on the\\noutside.\\n\\nHer weak hands were powerless to force the door. She crept back to the\\nwindow and threw open the sash. All that she could behold was a dense\\nmass of trees.\\n\\nA sturdy oak grew close to the window, its great branches spread out\\ninvitingly before her. It was a desperate chance to take in order to\\nreach the ground, which was fully thirty feet below.\\n\\nWould her strength give way? Dare she take the terrible risk?\\n\\n\"I must! I must!\" she cried. \"Heaven will protect me!\"\\n\\nWithout stopping to debate the matter further, lest she should lose\\ncourage, the poor girl climbed with difficulty out on the broad sill\\nand grasped one of the boughs.\\n\\nWould it bear her weight?\\n\\nThe great bough creaked with its unaccustomed weight, slight as it was,\\nthen shot downward.\\n\\nIn the old days at home Ida May had been accustomed to climb trees and\\nto swing about in their branches. She realized that when the bough bent\\nits entire length earthward she must let go her hold, or it would carry\\nher quickly up again. She let go her hold when she felt that the bough\\nof the tree had bent to its utmost. Quickly she fell downward, and Ida\\nMay, stunned and helpless for a moment, found herself lying in the long\\ngreen grass.\\n\\nShe had scarcely fallen three feet, yet the shock had stunned her.\\n\\nShe knew that she must be on some country road. Afar in the distance\\nshe could distinctly see rows of glimmering lights. Those she knew must\\nbe the lights of the city. She must reach it and find the house on\\nFifth Avenue before she dared give herself a moment\\'s rest.\\n\\nShe reached the outskirts of the city at last, and crept on toward its\\ngreat throbbing heart.\\n\\nLike one in a dream, Ida May saw a tall, thin woman and a young girl,\\nwho appeared to be her maid, step from a carriage.\\n\\nShe tried to get out of their way, but if her very life had depended\\nupon it, she could not have done so. The tall woman and Ida May jostled\\nagainst each other.\\n\\nWith a sharp exclamation of anger, the lady turned upon her. But at\\nthat moment Ida reeled, and, with a piteous moan, fell senseless at her\\nfeet.\\n\\n\"Well, well! here\\'s a pretty howdy-do!\" exclaimed the tall, angular\\nwoman. \"Here, John!\" she called to the footman, who was just shutting\\nthe door of the vehicle, \"pick up this poor creature, and carry her\\ninto the house. It appears I have knocked her down. I hope no bones are\\nbroken.\"\\n\\nThe house into which Ida May was carried was a very small cottage,\\noccupied by a poor laborer and his wife, who were the parents of a\\nlittle one who was ill but was slowly convalescing.\\n\\nThe wealthy spinster and her maid often called to bring some fruit or\\nmedicine to the child.\\n\\nMiss Fernly was not fair to look upon, but she had a heart of gold. She\\nwas quite eccentric; but her purse was always open to the wants of the\\nneedy.\\n\\n\"Leave the room instantly,\" she said to her maid. \"Run out and tell the\\ncoachman to go for the nearest doctor, and to fetch him back with him\\nat once!\"\\n\\nIt seemed an age until the doctor arrived. Everything in human power\\nwas done to render the sufferer comfortable.\\n\\nIt was early morn when the doctor departed--and there had come into\\nthis great world of sorrow a dark-eyed little stranger--a tiny little\\none, with a lovely face like its mother\\'s.\\n\\n\"Will it live?\" cried the young mother, as she listened breathlessly to\\nits faint little wails.\\n\\n\"I am afraid not,\" replied the doctor pityingly. \"We can only hope.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, if it would only die--only die!\" sobbed the girl\\'s mother. \"The\\nworld is so cold and so dark!\"\\n\\nMiss Fernly drew back, shocked and pained.\\n\\n\"You must not wish for anything like that to happen,\" she said, \"for\\nGod might take you at your word.\"\\n\\nFor ten long and weary days the hapless young mother lay with her face\\nto the wall, crying out to Heaven to take her and her baby from this\\ncruel world.\\n\\nIn great fear, the doctor had taken charge of the little one, and\\nconveyed it to a near-by foundling asylum. Its presence seemed to\\nirritate the hapless young mother, who was already in a high fever.\\n\\nMiss Fernly called every day at the cottage, to see how her latest\\ncharge was progressing.\\n\\nShe had taken a strange interest in the girl whose identity seemed\\nshrouded in such profound mystery.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIV.\\n\\n\\nThe beautiful girl lying so ill under Miss Fernly\\'s care grew steadily\\nworse. Her constant cry for the little one was most pitiful to hear.\\n\\n\"How are we to let her know that it is slowly fading away?\" said the\\nwoman to the doctor.\\n\\n\"We will not let her know until the last moment; it would do her no\\ngood, and be only a setback for her,\" he responded.\\n\\nMiss Fernly pitied the young mother from the very depths of her heart.\\nIt made this spinster more than ever enraged at men. She had tried to\\ngain the girl\\'s confidence. But it had all been in vain. Ida would lie\\nfor hours, looking out of the window at the fleecy clouds, muttering\\npiteously:\\n\\n\"It must have taken place by this time! Oh! I am too late, too late!\"\\n\\nAt last Miss Fernly\\'s curiosity got the better of her.\\n\\n\"Will you tell me what you mean by those words, my dear?\" she asked,\\none day. \"Perhaps I can help you in some way.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" returned Ida May, wearily. \"It would be useless, useless.\"\\n\\nMiss Fernly took the little white hand in her own and pressed it gently.\\n\\n\"Do not say that, my dear, and in that tone; it is not right. Heaven is\\nalways kind enough to send a friend to those who are in need of help.\"\\n\\n\"You are right,\" said the girl, quickly. \"In my life I have been used\\nto cruelty and unkindness. I--I--\"\\n\\nShe stopped for a moment, and something like a flush crossed her pale\\ncheeks; then she burst into tears.\\n\\n\"I will tell you my story, my good lady,\" she sobbed; \"for the weight\\nof it is eating my soul away.\"\\n\\nWith her throbbing little hands still held tightly in Miss Fernly\\'s,\\nshe sobbed wretchedly:\\n\\n\"Surely it is the cruelest story that ever a young girl had to tell. I\\nmight have led a happy life if I had not been foolish enough to want\\nto be a fine lady. I had often read of such things happening, and oh!\\nI believed it. Cinderella was changed from a kitchen-maid to a fairy\\nprincess, and oh! how happy she was, if but for a brief hour.\\n\\n\"It seemed to me that an opportunity always came for those who watched\\nfor it. One came to me. A wealthy family took me with them to Newport\\nfor the summer, and there I met a young man fair of face, handsome\\nas a dream. I had never before seen any one like him. You will not\\nwonder that my heart went out to him. I had known him but a few short\\nweeks ere he asked me to marry him, counseling a secret marriage, and\\nI--I consented. It was not a regular minister who married us, but\\na--a--mayor, or somebody like that.\\n\\n\"My husband brought me to the city. We had barely reached here, after\\nan all-night\\'s journey, when I learned to my horror that he believed me\\nto be the heiress of the wealthy people with whom I had been stopping.\\nWhen I told him I was not, what a change there came over him! With a\\nface as white as it would ever be in death, he drew back and looked at\\nme.\\n\\n\"\\'Not an heiress?\\' he cried. \\'Great heavens! what an eternal fool I\\nhave made of myself!\\'\\n\\n\"He left my presence quickly, telling me that it was all a\\nmistake--that the man who had married us had not the power to do so;\\nthat it was just as well, perhaps, for he never could wed a poor girl.\\n\\n\"He advised me to go home and forget him, adding insult to injury by\\nconcluding with the cruel words; \\'Such a little incident in the life of\\na working-girl will not amount to anything.\\'\"\\n\\n\"The scoundrel of a man!\" cried Miss Fernly, in intense indignation. \"I\\nwonder that a righteous God lets such men live!\"\\n\\nShe found herself intensely interested in the story of this beautiful\\nyoung girl, whose innocent face she could not help but trust from the\\nfirst moment that she beheld it.\\n\\nAt first it had occurred to Miss Fernly to ask the name of the rascal,\\nher husband; then she told herself that in all probability it was a\\nfalse one, and that he could not be traced by it.\\n\\n\"I will think the matter over,\" said Miss Fernly, \"and conclude what\\naction you should take. For your child\\'s sake, you can not allow this\\nman to go free. You would be committing a crime against society at\\nlarge.\"\\n\\nJust at that moment the doctor entered the room. He motioned Miss\\nFernly to one side. By some strange intuition, Ida May guessed the\\nimport of his visit.\\n\\n\"My--my little one!\" she cried, inquiringly--\"tell me of her! How is\\nshe?\"\\n\\nFor a moment the doctor was silent.\\n\\n\"I may as well tell the truth now as tell it at some future time,\" he\\nthought, pityingly.\\n\\n\"Tell me what news do you bring of my little child?\" cried Ida.\\n\\nHe crossed over to where the hapless young girl sat, and bent over her\\npityingly.\\n\\n\"The little one is dead!\" he said in a low, hushed voice.\\n\\nIt was dying when he left the foundling asylum. As he gazed upon it,\\nhe said to himself that it would be but a question of a few short\\nhours. He turned away from it, leaving it in the care of the good\\nnurses, that he might go and gently break the sad news to the young\\nmother.\\n\\nWhile Miss Fernly and the hapless young mother were discussing the\\nflowers they would plant over baby\\'s grave, the nurses, with bated\\nbreath, were standing around the little cot. Another physician sat by\\nthe cot, holding the waxen wrist.\\n\\n\"Quick! hand me the cordial!\" he cried. \"I may be able to save this\\nlittle life!\"\\n\\nA small vial was hurriedly handed to him. He poured a few drops between\\nthe white lips, and sat down again, patiently awaiting the result.\\n\\n\"If the infant lives five minutes, it will be able to pull through,\" he\\nobserved, quietly.\\n\\nThey watched the great clock on the opposite wall, whose pendulum swung\\nnoiselessly to and fro. One minute, two; there was no change. A third;\\nthe doctor bent his ear to listen for the feeble breathing, holding a\\nmirror close to the child\\'s lips. There was moisture upon it as he drew\\nit away. Another moment, the crucial moment, was reached.\\n\\n\"See! it is dying!\" whispered one of the nurses, touching the doctor\\'s\\narm.\\n\\nA half minute more, and then another half minute passed by.\\n\\n\"The baby will live!\" exclaimed the doctor, rising to his feet. \"Yes,\\nthe baby will live,\" repeated the doctor. \"It has had a hard time of\\nit, I see, but it has conquered death.\\n\\n\"It is so strange,\" he mused, \"whom nobody wants or seems to care for\\nclings to life most tenaciously, as though it were worth having.\\n\\n\"A few hours since I was at the home of one of the wealthiest families\\nin the city. That young mother\\'s babe died, though I did everything\\nin human power to save it. The father caught me by the arm when I was\\nfirst called there, and said:\\n\\n\"\\'Doctor, save that little child upstairs, and it will be the making of\\nyour fortune. You shall name your own price. Stay right here, by night\\nand by day, until it is out of danger, and anything you may ask for\\nshall be yours.\\'\\n\\n\"He led me through the marble hall and past gilded drawing-rooms and\\nspacious parlors to the chamber above where mother and child lay. It\\nwas a plump little mite, with everything to live for. I thought my task\\nwould be an easy one; but you have heard the old saying: \\'Man proposes,\\nbut God disposes.\\'\\n\\n\"Well it was so in this case. It had only the measles--a disease which\\nevery little one has at some time during infancy. No wonder I felt no\\nalarm.\\n\\n\"Although I did my best, it began to fail. I summoned all the experts\\nin the city, bringing together men who were older and wiser than\\nmyself, to discover what could possibly be the reason why my skill had\\nfailed me in this instance.\\n\\n\"There was nothing which science could suggest that we did not do. But\\nit seemed that fate was against us. The child literally faded before\\nour very eyes, and passed away.\\n\\n\"This one had no such chance of life as the other had, yet it has\\npassed through an illness so dangerous that not one in a thousand ever\\nlive through. I predict that it will have an uncommon future,\" he\\nadded, thoughtfully.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXV.\\n\\n\\nFor long hours after the doctor had left Ida May, she wept so bitterly\\nover the fate of her little child that Miss Fernly grew alarmed.\\n\\n\"Crying will not bring the baby back,\" she said. \"The Almighty knew\\nbest whether He wanted it to live or die. You must not rail against the\\njudgment of God!\"\\n\\nShe felt that she must draw her mind into another channel.\\n\\n\"Say that you will be more composed when I see you again,\" she replied,\\nearnestly, \"though it may not be for some days.\"\\n\\n\"I will try,\" murmured Ida May, with a sigh. \"Will it be long before I\\nsee you?\" she added, wistfully.\\n\\n\"I am going to my niece\\'s wedding,\" answered Miss Fernly. \"I may remain\\na few days after at the house.\"\\n\\nIda May drew a long, deep sob.\\n\\n\"How strange the word \\'marriage\\' sounds to me now,\" she moaned. \"When I\\nhear of a young girl\\'s marriage nowadays, I earnestly pray Heaven that\\nher husband may not deceive her!\"\\n\\n\"I am sure that there need be nothing to fear in _this_ instance,\" said\\nMiss Fernly. \"My niece sent me her _fiance\\'s_ picture this morning. He\\nseems to be a noble young fellow. By the way, I will show it to you,\"\\nshe added, still believing that the one thing needful was to divert the\\ngirl\\'s mind.\\n\\nThoughtless as to what would accrue from her action, Miss Fernly drew a\\nsmall case from her pocket and touched the spring.\\n\\nThe lid flew back, disclosing a magnificent affair in ivory--the\\nportrait of a young and handsome man.\\n\\n\"He has an honest look in his eyes, and a fair, open countenance,\" said\\nMiss Fernly. \"It was painted three years ago.\"\\n\\nAs she uttered the words, she handed the portrait to Ida May.\\n\\nOne glance, then a cry of the wildest horror broke from the girl\\'s\\nwhite, terrified lips.\\n\\n\"God have mercy!\" she gasped, \"it is he!\"\\n\\nMiss Fernly sprung to her feet, quite as white and terrified as Ida.\\n\\n\"You--you do not mean to say that this is the man who wrought all your\\nwoe?\" she cried, in horror too great for words.\\n\\n\"Yes!\" cried Ida May, springing to her feet, and crying out: \"I swear\\nto you that this is Royal Ainsley, the man whom I wedded, and who\\ndeserted me! This is the father of my little dead babe!\"\\n\\nThe expression upon Miss Fernly\\'s face was horrible to see.\\n\\nShe rose in awful wrath and struck her hands sharply together as she\\nturned and faced the girl.\\n\\n\"It was fate that sent you across my path,\" she exclaimed, hoarsely.\\n\"But for this timely intervention my innocent niece would have wedded\\nthat villain on the morrow. But I thank Heaven that I am now able to\\nprevent it, and to avenge you as well, my poor child. Ah!\" she cried,\\nas a sudden thought flashed through her mind, \"an idea has come to\\nme, by which I can not only wreak my vengeance upon him, but mete out\\njustice to you as well.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no, no; do not do anything to harm him!\" cried Ida May, in terror.\\n\"Cruel as he has been to me, I love him still, and I shall always love\\nhim!\"\\n\\n\"What I intend to do will not harm him. I repeat that it will right\\nyour wrong,\" she added, grimly. \"There shall be a wedding to-morrow,\\nmy poor, unfortunate girl. But listen to me well, and heed what I\\nsay--_you_ shall be this man\\'s bride to-morrow, instead of my niece.\\nLeave everything to me.\"\\n\\nShe gathered up her wrap and gloves and put them on.\\n\\n\"I shall have a great deal to do between now and nightfall. But this I\\nsay to you, Ida May: Be ready to go with me when I shall come for you.\\nIt may be to-night, perhaps to-morrow night. Ask me no questions now,\\nbut trust in me implicitly. Since the hour I came across you in your\\nmisfortune, you have found me a good friend to you, Ida May, have you\\nnot?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" sobbed Ida May, wretchedly. \"I--I--would have perished in the\\nstreet but for you, noble lady. I respect and have all confidence in\\nyou.\"\\n\\n\"Then by that confidence do as I bid you,\" repeated Miss Fernly. \"I\\nwill send some clothing for you to wear. Wrap about you the long, dark\\ncloak you wore in coming here, and be in readiness.\"\\n\\nWith these words, Miss Fernly fairly flew from the cottage.\\n\\nIda May sunk back in her chair, pale and excited.\\n\\n\"Why should the announcement that he is to be married to-morrow have\\nshocked me?\" she moaned. \"I had every reason to expect that would occur\\nany day after I read it myself in the paper.\"\\n\\nShe did not sob or cry out. It seemed to Ida that the very heart within\\nher was crushed. She had borne so much that it appeared there was\\nnothing more left for her to endure.\\n\\nMiss Fernly was thankful beyond words that she had not brought her maid\\nwith her on her last visit.\\n\\nIn all possible haste she hurried to the magnificent home of her sister\\non Riverside Drive.\\n\\nAlthough living in the same city, the married sister saw very little of\\nMiss Fernly, the latter devoted so much of her time to charity. She had\\nnot been to the house but once since Mrs. Cramer had written to her of\\nher daughter Hildegarde, and that she was soon to be married.\\n\\nHildegarde was delighted when she looked out and saw her aunt drive up.\\n\\n\"What a surprise, dear aunt!\" she cried, throwing her white arms about\\nher. \"Mamma and I were just speaking of you. I was almost afraid that\\nyou had forgotten the date set for the wedding. And just to think you\\nhave never met my intended, and he so anxious to see the darling aunt\\nI have always been talking of! I want you to see him, he is so lovely.\\nBut what did you think of the picture?\" rattled on Hildegarde, in her\\ngay, girlish fashion, without giving the other a chance to answer.\\n\\n\"You are very, very much in love with him?\" asked Miss Fernly,\\nanxiously.\\n\\n\"Why shouldn\\'t I be?\" cried the girl, blushing as red as a rose, and\\nhiding her peachy face against her aunt\\'s broad shoulder. \"No girl\\never had a more devoted lover.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, it is plainly to be seen that you do love him,\" said Miss Fernly,\\nsternly.\\n\\n\"I do not know what to tell you about him, auntie, except that he is\\nthe dearest fellow in all the world, and just adores me; at least, that\\nis what he tells me,\" said Hildegarde.\\n\\n\"Humph!\" ejaculated Miss Fernly.\\n\\n\"I would rather you would see him for yourself, then you could form\\nyour own opinion. He will be here this evening. I am sure you will like\\nhim.\"\\n\\n\"At what time do you expect him!\" asked Miss Fernly, with unusual\\ninterest.\\n\\n\"Let me answer you in the words of the song,\" said Hildegarde, laughing\\nlightly.\\n\\n     \"\\'Somebody\\'s coming when the dew-drops fall.\\'\"\\n\\n\"Do not be silly, Hildegarde,\" said her aunt, sharply.\\n\\n\"I asked you what time this young man is to call here this evening.\"\\n\\n\"It is generally half past seven when he arrives,\" said Miss Cramer,\\nsmiling mischievously.\\n\\n\"Very well,\" said Miss Fernly. \"When he calls, I will go down into the\\nparlor and interview him.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m sure he would be most delighted,\" returned the young girl,\\ndemurely.\\n\\n\"That\\'s neither here nor there,\" returned Miss Fernly. \"I do not care\\nwhether he likes me or not.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVI.\\n\\n\\nMiss Fernly had made her resolution. She would interview this man when\\nhe came. She would foil him, this fiend in human form, who would wed\\none young and lovely girl after bringing sorrow to another.\\n\\nWhen Miss Fernly made up her mind to a course, nothing could change it.\\n\\n\"What I am about to do is for Hildegarde\\'s good,\" she told herself\\ngrimly. \"There will be a few tears at first, but the time will come\\nwhen she will thank me with all her heart for saving her from such a\\nconsummate rascal. The woman of our race have never forgiven men who\\nhave deceived other women. Hildegarde should not be an exception to the\\nrule. She is young now, but when she comes to know more about life she\\nwill thank me for saving her.\"\\n\\n\"Now,\" said her aunt, aloud, depositing herself in the nearest chair,\\nand deliberately removing her hat and mantle, \"tell me about this\\nsweetheart of yours.\"\\n\\nHildegarde came over to the hassock and flung herself down upon it and\\nlooked up with laughing eyes into her aunt\\'s face.\\n\\n\"I sent you his picture,\" she said, \"because you did not seem inclined\\nto come here to meet him, auntie, so that you could see for yourself\\njust how he looks. But it does not do him justice,\" went on Hildegarde,\\nclasping her hands. \"That portrait does not tell you how good and noble\\nhe is, and how much he thinks of me!\"\\n\\nAn expression that was almost divine came over the face of Hildegarde\\nCramer as she uttered the words in a low, sweet voice.\\n\\n\"Tell me about him,\" again urged her aunt, anxious to fathom just how\\ndeep was the love the girl bore him.\\n\\nShould she confide in Hildegarde the story of Ida May, Miss Fernly knew\\nthat the present state of affairs must end.\\n\\nThere were girls who would turn in horror from a man who had done\\nas cruel a deed as that which was laid at the door of the man whom\\nHildegarde was about to marry. But might not Hildegarde cling to him\\ndespite all?\\n\\n\"He is all that is noble,\" continued Hildegarde, dreamily.\\n\\n\"What if he should cease to love you?\" said her aunt.\\n\\nHildegarde started; a quiver of pain passed over the lovely face.\\n\\n\"Cease to love me!\" she repeated. \"Ah! do you know what would happen to\\nme, auntie, if that were to occur? I should die, that is all. When all\\nwas gone that made life worth living, how could I live?\"\\n\\n\"It is not easy to die,\" said Miss Fernly, huskily.\\n\\n\"It would be easy for me,\" declared Hildegarde.\\n\\n\"One can not live without a heart, and I have given mine to my love.\"\\n\\nShe continued to talk of her lover in a sweet, girlish fashion; but\\nMiss Fernly scarcely heard a word she said, she was so engrossed in her\\nown thoughts and plans.\\n\\n\"You would be so glad if you knew just how perfectly happy I am,\\nauntie,\" she went on, in a half-dreamy fashion. \"Why, it doesn\\'t seem\\nthe same world to me. He came into my life as the sun breaks upon the\\nflowers, suddenly, swiftly, and all at once my life became complete. I\\nmet him on board the steamer. I shall never forget how it came about.\\nI had just come upon deck, and was about to walk to the railing, when\\nthe ship suddenly gave a lurch and I fell forward. I would have fallen\\nto the deck had not a young man who was standing near-by sprung quickly\\nforward and caught me. That was the beginning of our acquaintance. My\\nmother, who had followed me on deck, thanked him warmly. Love came to\\nme swiftly. At the first glance, when our eyes met, I knew that I had\\nmet the only one in the world that I could ever love. I loved him then\\nwith all my heart.\"\\n\\n\"Such a sudden love could not be a happy one; it could not end happily.\"\\n\\nThe girl smiled.\\n\\n\"In most instances that is the case,\" replied Hildegarde. \"But in\\nmine--mine--ah, Heaven is to be thanked--mine is to be a happy love,\\nand will have a happy ending!\"\\n\\nAh, if she had but known, if she had but guessed the thoughts that\\nfilled Miss Fernly\\'s heart, she might have died then and there.\\n\\nThe sun set, and the dusk crept into the room; but it was a subject\\nthat Hildegarde loved, and she could have talked on forever about her\\nlover.\\n\\n\"Mamma is quite late in returning,\" she said, at length. \"She may not\\neven come home to dinner.\"\\n\\nThis proved to be the case. Hildegarde and her aunt dined alone. She\\ncould not help but notice how her niece watched the clock with the\\nbrightest of eyes, the color deepening on her cheeks.\\n\\n\"I shall want to talk with this lover of yours alone,\" said Miss\\nFernly, a trifle hoarsely.\\n\\n\"Will you want to talk to him long, auntie?\" asked her niece, wistfully.\\n\\n\"Yes, an hour, or perhaps two. I ordered my carriage at seven; it will\\nbe here as soon as he arrives. He will drive home with me, and can talk\\nwith me in the carriage.\"\\n\\nHildegarde was a little surprised at this announcement, but it did not\\noccur to her to offer any objection.\\n\\n\"Ah, here he comes _now_!\" cried Hildegarde, blushing furiously, all in\\na flutter of delight.\\n\\nIn a moment it seemed to her that her aunt had donned her hat and\\nmantle. She was at the door as soon as the servant, dragging Hildegarde\\nby the arm.\\n\\nEugene Mallard was surprised to see Hildegarde coming to the door to\\nmeet him. Then his eyes fell upon the tall, austere woman in the rear.\\n\\nHe felt intuitively that this must be the aunt of whom Hildegarde\\nwas always speaking. Even before he heard the hurried words of\\nintroduction, the young man held out his hand with a cordial smile.\\n\\n\"I am most pleased to meet you, Miss Fernly,\" he said. \"I have heard\\nHildegarde speak of you so much that I feel as if I really knew and\\nloved you already.\"\\n\\nWas it only his fancy, or was the greeting of Hildegarde\\'s aunt a\\ntrifle chilly?\\n\\n\"You are to accompany my aunt to her home,\" said his _fiancee_; adding,\\nwith a little twinkle in her eye: \"Auntie has something to say to you.\"\\n\\nFor a moment he looked crestfallen; then he added, gallantly:\\n\\n\"I shall be most pleased. Pray command me, Miss Fernly.\"\\n\\nAnother moment, and they were seated in the carriage. He began to talk\\nbrightly to his companion; but to his great surprise, she answered him\\nonly in monosyllables.\\n\\n\"I am very much afraid she does not like me,\" he thought, with some\\nconsternation, and he redoubled his efforts to be agreeable. Any one\\nwho was related in any way to his darling Hildegarde was dear to him.\\nHe was always liked by women; he hoped from the depths of his heart\\nthat this lady would not form an aversion to him. But somehow he felt a\\ncold, uncomfortable chill creeping over his heart. Was it a premonition\\nof the evil that was so soon to come?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVII.\\n\\n\\nAlthough Eugene Mallard tried his best to entertain Hildegarde\\'s aunt\\nas they rode along, it seemed to him an almost impossible undertaking.\\nShe stared at him too intently that he wondered what she was thinking\\nof. He thought it might be as to whether he would make Hildegarde a\\ngood husband, and he wished with all his heart to set her doubts at\\nrest on this point, so he began to talk of Hildegarde, and tell her how\\nmuch he thought of her.\\n\\nThe more he spoke of her niece, the sterner Miss Fernly\\'s face seemed\\nto grow.\\n\\nHe was wondering to himself how long she would detain him, he longed so\\nfor to return to Hildegarde, who he knew was waiting for him with the\\nutmost impatience.\\n\\nSuddenly Miss Fernly turned to him.\\n\\n\"You say you would do anything for Hildegarde\\'s good--for her future\\nhappiness?\" she asked, slowly.\\n\\n\"Yes--certainly,\" he answered. \"I would lay down my life for her. No\\nsacrifice would be too great for me to make.\"\\n\\n\"You are sure of that?\" she asked, quickly.\\n\\n\"There is no question of it,\" Hildegarde\\'s lover answered, promptly.\\n\"To save her from a moment\\'s pain, I would lay down twenty lives if I\\nhad them.\"\\n\\n\"Very well; I will soon put you to the test,\" thought Miss Fernly.\\n\\nSuddenly the carriage came to a stop. To the young man\\'s great\\nsurprise, he found, as he assisted Miss Fernly to alight, that they\\nwere in front of a small and unpretentious church.\\n\\n\"Step this way,\" she said, leading him round to the door of the\\nparsonage.\\n\\nHe had heard that Miss Fernly was very religious; but her action now\\nrather puzzled him. Still without a thought of what the outcome might\\nbe, he followed where she led.\\n\\nShe spoke hurriedly to the coachman, and with a bow, he drove quickly\\naway.\\n\\n\"The minister has been called suddenly away to a sick person,\" said the\\ngirl who admitted them to the parsonage. \"He has begged me to say that\\nhe would return within the hour.\"\\n\\nThe young man wondered what business she had with the parson; but he\\nmade no comment, but followed her into the parsonage. The reception\\nroom into which they were shown was dimly lighted. Miss Fernly seemed\\nto be well acquainted there.\\n\\nMr. Mallard took the seat Miss Fernly indicated.\\n\\n\"I have something to say to you,\" she began, in a hard, set voice. \"I\\nshall break right into the subject at once. Your wedding with my niece\\nis fixed for to-morrow night, is it not?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he said, wonderingly.\\n\\n\"Why should not your marriage take place to-night--_here_ and _now_?\"\\nshe asked, looking intently at him.\\n\\nFor an instant he almost believed that the good lady had taken leave\\nof her senses. He stared at her in the most complete bewilderment.\\n\\nIn a slow and emphatic voice she repeated her words.\\n\\n\"My dear madame,\" he said, \"I do not see how that could possibly\\nbe. You know it is not to be a _quiet_ affair. Over five hundred\\ninvitations have been issued.\"\\n\\n\"You will be married to-night, and let to-morrow night take care of\\nitself,\" said Miss Fernly, sternly.\\n\\nHad Hildegarde sent her aunt to make this arrangement? He could hardly\\nbelieve his own senses. But surely it must be so.\\n\\nHe remembered the twinkle in her eyes as she had said.\\n\\n\"You are to ride with auntie, she has something to say to you.\"\\n\\n\"I am so dumfounded, I do not know how to answer you,\" he declared.\\n\\n\"You will not refuse me?\" she asked.\\n\\n\"Refuse you! How could I refuse a request in which my happiness is so\\nmuch bound up?\" he answered, eagerly.\\n\\n\"It is well!\" said Miss Fernly. \"Your bride is on the way here by this\\ntime.\"\\n\\n\"Is this idea one of _your_ planning?\" asked Hildegarde\\'s lover,\\ncuriously.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" she answered, very quickly.\\n\\nIt seemed a very strange proceeding to him, but he then did not pretend\\nto understand the ways of women. He was only too anxious to carry out\\nHildegarde\\'s slightest wish. He was so deeply in love with her that he\\ndid not question the strangeness of her aunt\\'s action.\\n\\nBefore he had time to think over the matter, two carriages drove up to\\nthe door from different directions. Out of one stepped the minister,\\nand from the other a slender figure, robed in snowy white, and almost\\nenveloped in a white tulle veil.\\n\\nHe would have sprung to meet her, but Miss Fernly held him back.\\n\\n\"Not yet,\" she said. \"She will meet us at the altar; the minister will\\nbring her in.\"\\n\\nMiss Fernly seemed to be running this novel affair, and he did not\\nsuppose that it would be worth while to try to dissuade her, since she\\nmust have talked it over with Hildegarde.\\n\\nHe followed her into the dimly lighted church, and down the long aisle\\nto the altar-rail. Only one light was lighted, which left all the\\ncorners of the great edifice in darkness and gloom.\\n\\nHe had naturally a great deal of nerve; but to save his life he could\\nnot help a feeling of awe coming over him.\\n\\nBefore he had time to say anything, he saw the minister in his clerical\\nrobes coming from an opposite direction with the bride-elect on his\\narm. His heart throbbed, every pulse quickened; a moment more, and they\\nhad advanced.\\n\\n\"My darling!\" he cried, as he sprang forward and clasped the trembling\\ngirl in his arms.\\n\\nShe tried to speak, but the words died away in her throat. It seemed to\\nEugene Mallard that he was in a dream. Even the girl who stood by his\\nside seemed scarcely real. The folds of the filmy veil almost concealed\\nher.\\n\\n\"Are you ready?\" asked the minister, opening the book.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" answered Eugene Mallard, promptly.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Miss Fernly, speaking for the bride-elect.\\n\\nThe marriage ceremony was begun. Then came the question solemnly,\\nwarningly, from the minister\\'s lips: \"If any one knows aught why this\\nman or woman should not be united in holy wedlock, let him now speak,\\nor forever hold his peace!\"\\n\\nThere was an ominous silence. Miss Fernly trembled. She was doing a\\nnoble action in righting a terrible wrong, she told herself, and there\\nwas no response to the clergyman\\'s appeal.\\n\\nIn a voice which seemed still more solemn, he pronounced the two before\\nhim man and wife.\\n\\nThe bridegroom caught the bride in his arms, and he laughed gayly to\\nsee how she trembled in his embrace.\\n\\n\"My wife!\" he cried, straining her to his heart. \"Sweet,\" he murmured\\nin a voice just audible to his bride, \"to be the lover of the girl you\\nlove, is bliss; but to be the husband of the girl you love, is heaven!\\nTell me, Hildegarde, are you not as happy as I am?\"\\n\\nA low cry broke from the white lips of the girl he held in his arms.\\nThe minister had stepped into the parsonage in response to a summons\\nfrom one of the servants, and invited the newly wedded couple and Miss\\nFernly to follow him.\\n\\nHe was not surprised that they held back a moment. It seemed to be the\\ncustom with all new-married couples to loiter for a moment in the dim\\nshadows of the old church. The critical moment of Miss Fernly\\'s triumph\\nhad come. She had done a noble action, she told herself. But somehow\\nshe trembled at the thought of what Eugene Mallard would do when he\\ndiscovered that the girl whom he had wedded was not the beautiful\\nHildegarde but the cruelly wronged Ida May.\\n\\nThe young husband had drawn his bride beneath the chandelier of the\\nchurch, and all unmindful of Miss Fernly\\'s presence, he declared,\\nrapturously:\\n\\n\"I must have a kiss from the lips of my wife.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he drew aside her veil. One glance at the face it had\\nhidden--oh, so piteous to behold in its awful pallor! and a cry, surely\\nthe most bitter that ever broke from human lips, issued from Eugene\\nMallard\\'s. His arms fell from the supple figure, and he drew back,\\ncrying hoarsely:\\n\\n\"You are _not_ Hildegarde! Great God! what does this mean? Who are you?\"\\n\\nMiss Fernly stepped forward.\\n\\n\"I wonder that you ask such a question!\" she cried, shrilly. \"Look upon\\nher, and behold for yourself the young girl you _duped_ and deserted!\\nNow, thank Heaven, she is your wedded wife!\" she added, triumphantly.\\n\"I have helped her to right her wrongs!\"\\n\\n\"But I never saw this young woman before!\" cried Eugene Mallard,\\nstriking his forehead with his clinched hand. \"There is some terrible\\nmistake! Speak out!\" he cried to the girl at his side, who was\\ntrembling like an aspen-leaf. \"Who are you who has done this terrible\\ndeed?\"\\n\\nLike one dying, the hapless bride fell on her knees at Miss Fernly\\'s\\nfeet.\\n\\n\"There is some terrible mistake!\" she cried, wildly. \"I--I did not\\ndiscover it until he drew back my veil. He--is--not--the man!\"\\n\\n\"Not the man?\" repeated Miss Fernly, aghast, hardly believing that she\\nhad heard aright, her eyes almost starting from their sockets. \"I--I do\\nnot understand!\" she cried, recoiling from the girl. \"Do you mean that\\nthe man you have just wedded, and the one to whom you told me was the\\ncause of wrecking your life, is not one and the same?\"\\n\\nThe girl shook her head, while Eugene Mallard looked from one to the\\nother like one in a dream from which he was expecting to soon awake.\\n\\nMiss Fernly caught her by the shoulder.\\n\\n\"What does it mean?\" she cried, hoarsely. \"You assured me that this man\\nwas the cause of all your trouble, and now you dare to tell me that\\nhe is not the one! And I--brought about this, making you his wife! It\\nwas a trick of yours, you shameless creature, to secure a husband for\\nyourself. Quick! Be gone from this sacred edifice ere I strike you down\\nat my feet, you most shameless outcast, you horrible creature!\"\\n\\nIda May drew back in terror from the upraised hand.\\n\\n\"Hold!\" cried Eugene Mallard, stepping between them. \"No matter what\\nthis poor creature has done, she is, in the eyes of God and man, my\\nwife!\"\\n\\nBy a dexterous movement he had raised the poor girl from her knees, and\\nhad swung her out of the reach of the blow that had been meant for her.\\nDespite his anguish, it aroused all the pity and chivalry in his nature\\nto see how the poor thing clung to him in her terror.\\n\\n\"Save me from her wrath,\" she murmured, clinging to him with\\ndeath-cold hands, and adding vehemently: \"Believe me, it was all a\\nhorrible mistake! I saw your picture, and--and I mistook you for\\nanother. The church was so dimly lighted, I--I could not see, and I did\\nnot know the terrible mistake until--until it was too late! Oh, tell\\nme, tell me, what can I do to undo the great wrong that I have done\\nyou?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\\n\\n\\nEugene Mallard had sunk into the nearest seat, covering his face\\nwith his hands. The horror of the situation had just come to him. By\\nthe cruel working of fate he had been wedded to one woman through a\\nhorrible mistake, while his heart and soul were another\\'s.\\n\\nIt seemed to him like some horrible dream from which he must soon\\nawake. He had parted from Hildegarde full of hope and love, scarcely\\nan hour before, saying to himself, as he turned and looked back at\\nher, that ere the sun would rise and set again, she would be his own,\\nthat they would never be parted from each other after that. And now\\na barrier had suddenly risen between them which parted them just as\\nsurely as though one of them lay in the grave.\\n\\nHis whole soul was bound up in Hildegarde; yet he was wedded to\\nanother. It seemed to him that the anguish of it was more than he could\\nbear.\\n\\nThen came to him the thought that he must protect the woman he had\\nwedded--this poor young creature who still clung to him, imploring him\\nto save her from Miss Fernly\\'s wrath, repeating to him, over and over\\nagain, that it was a mistake.\\n\\nEugene Mallard roused himself from the stupor which was stealing over\\nhim. He must face the terrible consequences of that rash marriage.\\nAlthough this girl had wrecked his life, ruined his future, yet he\\ncould not find it in his heart to curse her.\\n\\nHe could not help but believe her--that it was some terrible mistake;\\nhe could not judge her before he knew more about what had prompted her\\nto do this deed. He could not rest until he knew the reason that lay\\nbehind it.\\n\\n\"Tell me all about it,\" he said, hoarsely, turning to the girl, \"that I\\nmay judge for myself of this action of yours.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, tell him,\" cried Miss Fernly, \"that I may be cleared of my part\\nin this transaction. You deceived me as well.\"\\n\\nIn a faltering voice that sounded as though she were dying, Ida May\\ntold her story, the man she had married listening intently.\\n\\nHe did not speak until she had concluded, but Miss Fernly saw that the\\ngirl\\'s story was greatly affecting him.\\n\\n\"No wonder you mistook me for Royal Ainsley, when you saw that\\npicture,\" he exclaimed, \"for we are cousins. The resemblance between us\\nwas most marked when that picture was taken.\"\\n\\n\"I--I--thought the name Miss Fernly told me was an assumed name, or\\nelse you had given me a false one.\"\\n\\nMiss Fernly\\'s self-control seemed to leave her entirely as she listened.\\n\\n\"I am responsible for it!\" she groaned, wringing her hands. \"Oh, what\\nwill Hildegarde and my sister say!\"\\n\\nEugene Mallard and Miss Fernly looked into each other\\'s faces, and\\ntheir lips were mute.\\n\\n\"Let me go to her and tell her my story,\" sobbed the hapless bride,\\n\"then I will go away, and you shall never look upon my face again!\"\\n\\n\"That would not mend matters,\" replied Eugene Mallard. \"I have married\\nyou, and nothing can undo that.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, do not say so!\" cried Ida May. \"I will free you from the bond\\nwhose links have just been forged. You shall have a divorce. I will set\\nyou free!\"\\n\\nEugene Mallard shook his head.\\n\\n\"You would do so if you could,\" he answered; \"but, alas! you can not.\\nThose whom God hath joined together no one has the right to put\\nasunder.\"\\n\\nWith a sigh that nearly rent his heart, he rose to his feet. The\\ncarriage still stood in waiting at the door.\\n\\n\"Where are you going?\" asked Miss Fernly.\\n\\n\"We will all three go to Hildegarde, and break it as gently as we can\\nto her--tell her what has happened--break the sad story to her as\\ngently as we can,\" Eugene repeated.\\n\\nAs one whose feet refused to do her bidding, Miss Fernly tottered up\\nthe aisle behind them. What would Hildegarde say--what would she do?\\nPerhaps she would fall dead at their feet, for she loved, with all the\\npassionate love of her heart, the man whom she had promised to wed on\\nthe morrow.\\n\\n\"Oh, if I had not been so hasty!\" cried Miss Fernly. \"I meant to do a\\nnoble action, but instead I have wrecked two lives!\"\\n\\nThey entered the carriage in silence--a silence which was not broken\\nuntil they reached the door of the beautiful Cramer mansion. They saw\\nHildegarde standing at the lace-draped window, peering out into the\\ndarkness, eagerly watching for them.\\n\\nThe hapless young lover groaned aloud. Miss Fernly hid her face in her\\nhands. Hildegarde was at the door to greet them almost as soon as the\\nservant.\\n\\n\"You have been gone very long, Eugene!\" she cried. \"Dear me! how\\nsurprised I was to see Aunt Fernly returning with you!\"\\n\\nThen her eyes fell upon the girl in bridal robes her lover was holding\\nby the hand. She did not recognise Ida May because of the veil which\\nshe had drawn down over her face, nor did she hear the cry of surprise\\nIda May uttered when she recognized her.\\n\\nMiss Fernly had always spoken of the bride to be as her niece, but had\\nnever once mentioned her name.\\n\\nFor one moment Ida May stood irresolute. She now realized what she had\\ndone, and wondered how Hildegarde would take the terrible mistake.\\n\\nFor a moment the three stood silent. Who would be the one to break the\\nterrible news to Hildegarde?\\n\\n\"What is the matter, and who is this beautiful young girl, clad in\\nbridal robes, whom you hold by the hand, Eugene?\"\\n\\nHe tried to speak, but he could not utter a word if his life had\\ndepended upon it. Even Miss Fernly seemed to have been stricken dumb.\\nIda May knew that it devolved upon her to utter the words which would\\nstab Hildegarde Cramer to the very soul. She saw the lover try to\\nspeak, and fail, and also saw Miss Fernly\\'s lips twitch convulsively.\\n\\nNerving herself for the ordeal through which she must pass, she stepped\\nforward.\\n\\n\"Let _me_ answer for them,\" she said, in a voice that sounded to\\nHildegarde\\'s ears like the strain of some half-forgotten melody. And as\\nshe uttered the words she threw back her veil.\\n\\n\"Ida May!\" cried Hildegarde, aghast.\\n\\n\"Yes, I am that hapless creature whom you knew as Ida May.\"\\n\\nFor an instant there was silence, broken only by the sound of the\\nlabored breathing of Miss Fernly, Hildegarde, and Eugene Mallard.\\n\\nIn an instant the haughty heiress had recovered herself. She recoiled\\nfrom the girl who advanced pleadingly before her.\\n\\n\"Hildegarde! Hildegarde!\" Ida cried, much to the astonishment of Miss\\nFernly and her companion, \"I did not know that it was you whom I was to\\nconfront in this awful hour!\"\\n\\nBut Hildegarde shrunk still further from her. How dared this creature,\\nwho had passed those weeks at Newport a living lie, to claim\\nacquaintance with her!\\n\\nShe flushed crimson, and retreated from her in abhorrence, wondering\\nhow this creature had come here, accompanied by her aunt and lover.\\n\\n\"Hildegarde!\" cried Ida May, \"listen, for the love of Heaven, and do\\nnot judge me too harshly until you have heard all!\"\\n\\nSobbing wildly, Ida caught at the hem of Hildegarde\\'s dress.\\n\\n\"Auntie!\" cried Hildegarde, turning to her relative, \"I do not care\\nto listen to anything this--this person has to say. The very air she\\nbreathes stifles me. Eugene!\" she cried, springing to her lover\\'s side,\\n\"take me in to the drawing-room. I--I can not talk to this young girl.\"\\n\\nHe did not clasp her in his arms, though he made a movement to do so.\\nHis arms fell to his sides, and his head drooped to his breast.\\n\\nHe was enduring torture so acute that many a man would have fainted\\nunder the strain of it.\\n\\nHildegarde looked up into his face in wonder.\\n\\n\"Eugene, my darling!\" she cried \"are you ill? Tell me! Something\\nterrible must be the matter! Why do you not speak?\"\\n\\nIn that instant she seemed to forget the presence of everybody, save\\nthe lover who had parted from her a few hours since, and who was now\\nstanding before her so greatly changed.\\n\\nShe looked from one to the other in consternation.\\n\\n\"Something has happened,\" she said. \"Why do you keep me in suspense?\"\\n\\n\"I am trying to tell you,\" sobbed Ida May, \"but you will not listen.\"\\n\\n\"Must I listen to her, auntie?\" cried Hildegarde, turning to her aunt.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Miss Fernly, \"you must listen, my poor child, while I pray\\nto Heaven to give you strength to bear it.\"\\n\\n\"Eugene!\" cried the girl, \"why are you silent?\"\\n\\nHe could not answer her. He only looked at her with a world of woe in\\nhis gaze, his whole frame trembling with anguish.\\n\\nIda May never knew in what words she told her strange story. Hildegarde\\nlistened like one turned to stone. Ida May told her of the awful\\nmistake that had blasted two lives and parted two who fondly loved each\\nother.\\n\\nThose who saw the look of pity in the face of Hildegarde would never\\nforget it.\\n\\nHer face became as pale as marble; the blood receded from the ripe-red\\nlips.\\n\\nShe passed through a life-time of woe in those few minutes. She did not\\nlook at Ida May or her lover when the former ceased speaking, but she\\nturned her white, set, tragic face to her aunt.\\n\\n\"_You_ have done this dreadful thing!\" she cried. \"I wonder that Heaven\\ndoes not strike you dead for it!\"\\n\\n\"Hildegarde! Hildegarde!\" cried Miss Fernly, \"I would only be too glad\\nto give my life to atone for my part in this dreadful affair.\"\\n\\nThe girl looked at her with eyes like jets of flame.\\n\\n\"If you had but told me,\" she said, in a voice that was more sorrowful\\nthan any tears could have been. \"You took the reins into your own\\nhands; you meddled with the affairs of another, and see the mischief\\nyou have wrought!\"\\n\\nA sort of frenzy seemed to possess her.\\n\\n\"Go!\" she cried, turning to Ida May, and pointing toward the door. \"Get\\nout of this house, out of my sight, before I call the servants to fling\\nyou into the street!\"\\n\\nIda May crept toward the door. To Hildegarde\\'s intense surprise, Eugene\\nMallard turned to follow her.\\n\\n\"I will go with you,\" he said, huskily, \"for you--you are my--my wife!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIX.\\n\\n\\n\"Yes; where she goes, I must follow,\" repeated Eugene Mallard, in a\\nvoice husky with emotion, \"for she is my wife!\"\\n\\nThe words fell upon Hildegarde\\'s ears with a dreadful shock. It was not\\nuntil then that she realized her lover was separated from her.\\n\\nShe saw him take Ida May\\'s hand and lead her slowly out of the house.\\n\\nIn the years that followed she wondered that the sight did not kill her.\\n\\nWhen the door closed after them, Hildegarde stood for a moment stunned,\\nwith a white, awful pallor on her face.\\n\\nMiss Fernly watched her in silence.\\n\\nWas Hildegarde going mad? If she would only cry out, utter some word.\\nBut no; only that awful silence. \"Hildegarde,\" said Miss Fernly,\\napproaching her tremblingly, \"what can I say, what can I do, to repair\\nthe terrible wrong I have done you?\"\\n\\n\"The only thing you can do is to kill me,\" answered the girl, in a\\nhoarse, unnatural voice.\\n\\n\"Oh, my niece! my precious niece, do not say that!\" replied Miss\\nFernly, beside herself with grief. \"You will break my heart!\"\\n\\n\"Yours is not the only one that will be broken,\" returned Hildegarde.\\n\\nMiss Fernly attempted to approach her, but Hildegarde drew back in\\nloathing.\\n\\n\"Do not come near me!\" she cried, with flashing eyes, \"lest I forget\\nwho you are, and strike you dead at my feet!\"\\n\\nWith a quick motion, Hildegarde turned, and without another word, flew\\nup the staircase and up to her own _boudoir_, and closed the door\\nsecurely after her.\\n\\n\"Let me realize it,\" she murmured. \"A few hours ago I was the happiest\\ngirl the world held; now I cry out to Heaven to end my life.\"\\n\\nShe crept up to the mirror, and she stood before it, tall, slender, and\\nerect in the dignity of her own despair, her face white, her dark eyes\\ndark with sorrow.\\n\\n\"Can that be me?\" she murmured, crossing her hands over her breast. But\\nthe figure reflected gave back no answer.\\n\\n\"He has gone out of my life. What am I to do?\" she murmured. \"One can\\nnever be sure of anything in this world. He left me only a few hours\\nago, and there was nothing between us but love. I can not believe it!\\nIt is some awful dream from which I shall presently awake!\"\\n\\nShe wrung her hands wildly; she tore her beautiful dark hair; she was\\nas one mad with anguish. Then she thought of Ida May, and she clinched\\nher hands.\\n\\nSome one knocked at the door\\n\\n\"Let me in, Hildegarde!\" cried her mother, anxiously.\\n\\n\"No!\" answered the girl. \"I can not--do not ask me. Only leave me here\\nalone. The sight of human faces, the sound of human voices, would drive\\nme mad!\"\\n\\nAll in vain the mother pleaded. Suddenly she heard a fall, and when one\\nof the servants whom Mrs. Cramer had summoned burst open the door, she\\nfound Hildegarde lying face downward on the velvet carpet.\\n\\nMiss Fernly had told her sister all, made a clean breast of the whole\\naffair. But Hildegarde\\'s mother did not curse her, as she feared she\\nmight do. She only looked at her sister with horror-stricken eyes.\\n\\nFor a fortnight Hildegarde lay on the bed where they had placed her.\\n\\nThe doctor had worked over her for hours.\\n\\n\"She is young,\" he said to the heart-broken mother, \"and while there is\\nlife there is hope.\"\\n\\nWhen she arose from her bed, every one was startled at the change in\\nher. She made no complaint, even to Miss Fernly, who hovered around her\\nin an agony more pitiful than words can describe.\\n\\nHildegarde was like one on whom the shadow of death had fallen. She\\ngrew thin and white; the light was gone from her beautiful eyes, the\\ncolor from her beautiful face.\\n\\nNo smile, no sound of laughter, came to the pale lips. If her mother,\\nwhose heart ached over her beloved child, tried to cheer her, she had\\nbut one answer for her, and it was:\\n\\n\"I shall die soon, my heart is slowly bleeding to death.\"\\n\\nThen came the announcement that Hildegarde was going abroad. But the\\npaper did not state how long she would remain.\\n\\nThis looked very serious indeed to the friends who had hoped against\\nall hope.\\n\\nMrs. Cramer was anxious that none of her companions should behold her,\\nshe was so terribly altered. She could not bear the criticisms which\\nshe knew her appearance would be sure to occasion. But Hildegarde had\\nstoutly declared she would not go abroad.\\n\\n\"I want to die in my native land,\" pleaded the girl, piteously.\\n\\nShe sought her couch early, because her mother was anxious about her;\\nbut her mother did not know that she paced the floor until the gray\\ndawn.\\n\\nNow her mother hastened the preparations for the trip abroad.\\n\\n\"She is young, and a change of air and scene will surely bring about\\nforgetfulness,\" thought Mrs. Cramer.\\n\\nIt was well for her that she could not foresee what was to happen in\\nthe near future.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXX.\\n\\n\\nWe must return to Ida May, dear reader, and picture to you the awful\\nwoe she experienced as she turned from Hildegarde, saying. \"Let me go\\naway out of your lives; if my life could atone for what I have done, I\\nwould give it.\"\\n\\nShe scarcely heard Eugene Mallard\\'s words, \"Where you go, I must\\nfollow, for you are my wife.\"\\n\\nShe was unaware of his presence, until fleeing down the graveled walk,\\nshe heard a step behind her, and a firm hand caught her arm. Turning,\\nshe saw the man whom she had just wedded.\\n\\nShe drew back in fear and trembling. He noticed her action, and despite\\nhis bitter woe he could not but feel sorry for her.\\n\\n\"We can not undo what has been done, my poor girl,\" he said. \"It was a\\nterrible mistake, but we must face it bravely.\"\\n\\nShe looked up into his face with wistful eyes.\\n\\n\"If you would only kill me here and now, I would be so grateful to you.\\nNo one would ever know. My life is of so little account that not one\\nin the whole world would miss me or grieve for me, and then you could\\nmarry Hildegarde!\"\\n\\nHe drew back shocked.\\n\\n\"You must not speak in that way,\" he said. \"The life of every human\\nbeing is sacred. You are entitled to your life, no matter what has\\nhappened, until God calls you. I do not blame you, my poor girl, for\\nwhat has happened. I only say we must try to face the future, and to\\nsee what can be done.\"\\n\\nBefore he could realize what she was about to do, she had flung herself\\non her knees at his feet, and covered his hands with kisses. Her heart\\nwas full of the deepest gratitude to him. He was the only being who had\\never spoken kindly to her of late.\\n\\nHe raised her gently.\\n\\n\"You should not kneel to me,\" he said, \"it is not right.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I will!\" she cried, impulsively. \"You are good--you are noble.\\nYou do not curse me for what I could not help. I want to show you how\\nbitterly I deplore what has been done! But how are you to realize it?\"\\n\\nWhile they were speaking, a few drops of rain fell from the heavens,\\nand Ida May, looking up, said to herself that even the angels above\\nwere weeping for her.\\n\\n\"Come!\" he said, taking her by the hand and leading her along as though\\nshe were a little child, \"you can not stand out in the rain. Come with\\nme!\"\\n\\nHe hailed a passing cab and placed her in it.\\n\\n\"Where are we going?\" she asked, timidly, looking up into his troubled\\nface.\\n\\n\"I do not know until I have had time to think,\" he answered. \"I have\\ntold the driver to drive about for an hour. By that time I shall have\\narrived at some conclusion.\"\\n\\nThe girl\\'s dark head drooped. Great as her own sorrow was, her heart\\nbled for the trouble which she had unintentionally caused this young\\nman.\\n\\nOn and on rolled the cab. So busy was Eugene Mallard with his own\\ntroubled thoughts that he almost forgot the girl shrinking away in her\\ncorner, who was regarding him so piteously and anxiously.\\n\\nSuddenly he turned to her.\\n\\n\"There is but one course left open to us,\" he said, huskily, \"and that\\nwe must follow. You are my wife, and I must take you to the home that\\nhas been prepared to receive my bride.\"\\n\\nShe uttered a low cry; but before she could speak, he hastened to add:\\n\\n\"No advantage shall be taken of the position in which you are so\\nstrangely placed. You shall be my wife in the eyes of the world, but\\nto me you shall be just as sacred as a sister. We will live our lives\\nthrough in this way.\"\\n\\nShe bowed her head. Whatever he suggested must be wisest and best, she\\nthought.\\n\\n\"Indeed, I can see no other way out of it at the present outlook,\" he\\nwent on, his voice trembling a little. \"I will take you to a hotel near\\nwhere I am stopping. To-morrow, at this time, I will come for you to\\ntake the train with me!\"\\n\\nA little later Ida found herself alone in the comfortable room which he\\nhad secured for her at the hotel.\\n\\nIt was then and not until then that the poor girl gave vent to her\\ngrief, suffering almost as deeply as did Hildegarde, as the long hours\\nof the night passed away.\\n\\nThe sun was shining bright and warm when she opened her eyes the next\\nmorning. For a moment she was dazed and bewildered; then a rush of\\nmemory came to her, and she remembered all that had taken place. She\\nsprung from her couch with a bitter sob on her lips. Some one tapped at\\nthe door. It was the chamber-maid.\\n\\n\"Your breakfast is to be served to you here, ma\\'am,\" she said. \"The\\nwaiter is bringing it. I will take it from him. Here are also some\\nlarge packages which arrived for you.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you!\" murmured the girl. \"Just put them on the table. But stay,\"\\nshe added in the next breath; \"you may as well open them. I do not\\nthink they are for me.\"\\n\\nWith deft fingers the girl unwrapped the bundle, and held up to her\\nastonished gaze a beautiful brown traveling suit of the finest cloth,\\nwith hat, shoes, gloves, and _lingerie_ to match. Gazing upon the\\noutfit with wide-opened eyes, she forgot her sorrow for the moment.\\n\\nThis was another proof of the thoughtfulness and kindness of the man\\nwhose life she had wrecked.\\n\\n\"What a superb traveling-dress!\" cried the maid, with delight. \"I have\\nnever seen anything like it. And the hat; why, it is a veritable dream,\\nmadame. It is so exquisitely dainty! There is something in the pocket\\nof the dress!\" exclaimed the maid. \"Does madame wish me to see what it\\nis?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Ida.\\n\\nThe next moment the girl had produced a tiny box. On a bed of violet\\nvelvet reposed a band of plain gold. Within were the engraved words:\\n\"My wife!\"\\n\\nThe poor girl caught her breath with a sob as the maid handed it to\\nher. The color came and went on her face; her eyes grew dim with tears.\\nIt was with the greatest difficulty that she succeeded in hiding her\\nemotion from the maid, whose eyes were intently fixed on her.\\n\\n\"I thought she was a single young girl,\" she thought, \"but she seems to\\nbe married.\"\\n\\nIda May turned away; she could not bear to have any one see her emotion.\\n\\n\"I can not accept it, nor any of his gifts, because I can not make use\\nof them,\" she thought. \"I am going away from here, going out of his\\nlife. I could not go with him to his Southern home; I have no right\\nthere!\"\\n\\nWhen the maid came to her, and asked her if she wished all her meals\\nserved in her room, she mechanically answered, \"Yes.\" Tempting dishes\\nwere brought, but they went back untasted.\\n\\n\"The lady in Room 27 seems very ill,\" said the chamber-maid, when she\\nwent down to the servant\\'s hall below. \"She is _very_ mysterious. Her\\neyes are so big, so black, and so mournful, you are sure she is going\\nto burst into tears at every word she utters. She looks like a creature\\nwho has passed through some great sorrow. With the exception of _one_\\nlady, I never saw any-one else look like that. And oh, mercy! she had\\nthe same room too--No. 27.\\n\\n\"This woman left word that I was to come to her in the morning. To my\\ngreat surprise, I found the door open as I turned the knob. As I went\\nforward to awaken her, I saw the still form lying on the bed. As I\\napproached, I saw, to my great amazement, that her eyes were wide open\\nand staring at me.\\n\\n\"\\'I beg your pardon for not coming sooner, ma\\'am,\\' I said. \\'I did not\\nthink you would be awake so early. There--\\'\\n\\n\"The rest of the sentence was never finished. I saw that the eyes\\nstaring up into mine were glazed in death. The scream I uttered brought\\nhalf the people in the hotel to the scene, a physician being among them.\\n\\n\"He said that the young lady had been dead some hours. She had taken\\npoison. The mystery surrounding her--who she was, and whence she came,\\nhas never been solved from that day to this. There is much the same\\nlook in this lady\\'s face as there was in that other one\\'s. I think she\\nwill bear watching.\\n\\n\"You know, too, that nine out of ten of the people who think of\\ncommitting suicide choose a hotel in which to commit the deed. This\\nyoung lady in No. 27 seems to be dazed. She scarcely knows what one is\\nspeaking to her about.\"\\n\\nHaving told her story, the chamber-maid left the room, shaking her\\nhead as she went. The clerk of the hotel, who was passing through the\\ncorridor, and who had heard the story was a little annoyed over it. He\\nknew the habit of the maids to gossip; still, there might be some truth\\nin the story.\\n\\nIt would certainly not be amiss to look into the matter a little. He\\nremembered a tall and handsome gentleman had made arrangements for the\\nlady, paying her bills in advance.\\n\\nHe thought he would wait a day and then speak to the proprietor\\nconcerning the matter.\\n\\nThe sunshine of the afternoon faded; the gloaming crept up, deepening\\ninto the soft beauty of the starry night.\\n\\nAs the hours rolled by, the girl made a resolve to end it all.\\n\\nShe arose quietly and donned the dark cloak which Miss Fernly had\\nwrapped about her as they stepped from the rector\\'s cottage. She was\\nglad to have it now, for it would cover the bridal robes which she had\\ndonned. Her bridegroom was to be death!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXI.\\n\\n\\nWith trembling hands, this hapless girl, who had taken such a terrible\\nresolve, opened the door of her room, and glided softly down the long\\ncorridor and out of the hotel.\\n\\nIda May had scarcely gained the street before a carriage drove up, and\\nEugene Mallard sprung from it. He was surprised at seeing Ida advancing\\nto meet him. She drew back with a cry.\\n\\n\"Are you ready?\" he asked; but before she could answer, he went on:\\n\"You do not wear your traveling-dress. Was there anything amiss with\\nit?\"\\n\\nShe tried to keep back the sobs from her lips; but almost before she\\nwas aware of it, she had confessed to him that she was about to flee\\nfrom him.\\n\\nStanding there, very gently and patiently, he went over the ground\\nwith her, insisting upon her following out their original plan;\\nand the upshot of it all was, she returned to her room, donned her\\ntraveling-dress, joined him again, and took a seat beside him in the\\ncarriage.\\n\\nA little later the railway station was reached, and they were soon\\nwhirling away toward the mysteries of the future.\\n\\n\"We will reach our destination a little before midnight,\" Eugene said,\\nseating himself opposite her. \"There will be a number of old friends\\nat the station to give my bride a welcome home,\" he added in a voice\\nthat was husky, despite his efforts at self-control; and Ida knew that\\nhe was thinking of that _other_ bride whom he had intended to bring to\\nthem, and she felt most wretched at the effort he was making to look\\nthe present difficulty in the face and bear up under it.\\n\\nHow he must loathe her! Her very presence must be hateful to him! The\\nthought of that made her shrink still further from Eugene Mallard.\\n\\nShe felt like opening the car window and springing from it out into the\\nblackness of the night. Then he would be free to marry Hildegarde. On\\nand on through the darkness rushed the express.\\n\\n\"The next station will be ours,\" he said at length. Ida looked up in\\napprehension. There would be a party of friends awaiting Eugene\\'s\\nhome-coming; but, ah! what would they say when they saw that it was not\\nHildegarde whom he had wedded? Had he a mother--had he sisters?\\n\\nPerhaps he divined her thoughts, for quite as soon as they had flashed\\nthrough her brain he turned to her, and said, abruptly:\\n\\n\"I have told you nothing of my home life. It was an oversight on\\nmy part, possibly because the idea did not occur to me. I have no\\nrelatives upon the face of the earth, except the scape grace cousin\\nyou know of. From my uncle I inherited the Virginia home to which\\nI am taking you. It is presided over by Mrs. Rice, an old lady who\\nhas served in the capacity of housekeeper for twenty years. All the\\nservants have been in the household quite as long a time. They are\\ngood and faithful to me. They will receive you warmly. Your word shall\\nbe their law. No one outside the household will know of our strained\\nrelationship. The secret will be kept faithfully from the world by the\\nmembers of my household.\"\\n\\n\"I do not deserve so much consideration at your hands,\" murmured the\\ngirl.\\n\\nBefore he had time to reply, their station was reached. There were few\\npeople at the station owing to the lateness of the hour.\\n\\nAn old-fashioned carry-all was waiting at the rear. Peering out from it\\nwas the face of old Black Joe.\\n\\n\"Welcome, marse! welcome!\" he cried. \"An\\' a thousand welcomes to the\\nlovely young missus, your bride! There\\'s a great company at the house,\\nsir, awaiting you both.\"\\n\\nEugene Mallard thanked the old <DW52> servant for his kind wishes for\\nhimself and bride, as he helped Ida into the vehicle.\\n\\nThere was a long ride over a rough mountain road, during which time,\\nmuch to old Black Joe\\'s surprise, scarcely a word was exchanged between\\nthe bride and groom, and it puzzled the good old man.\\n\\nWas the lady ill? So great was his concern over it, that he was tempted\\nto ask his master the question a dozen times. But prudence restrained\\nhim.\\n\\nAt length, in turning an abrupt curve in the road, a gray stone\\nmansion, fairly ablaze with lights from cellar to dome, loomed in\\nsight--lights that twinkled like glow-worms in the distance. They could\\nhear the strains of music, and as they approached they could even hear\\nthe sound of voices.\\n\\nStill no word was uttered by either of them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXII.\\n\\n\\nIn less time than it takes to tell it, the strained relationship\\nbetween Eugene Mallard and his bride was whispered through the\\nhousehold. They had laughed at old Black Joe when he had whispered the\\nstory of their silence from the railroad station, declaring he was\\nromancing. Later events certainly gave color to the story, however. She\\nwas all that was sweet and fair. What could be the trouble?\\n\\n\"If there was ever a bride most wretchedly unhappy, she is that one,\"\\nsaid Mrs. Rice, shaking her head.\\n\\n\"Why did he marry her if he did not love her? I can not understand it,\\nI am sure.\"\\n\\nMrs. Rice went to the bride\\'s room the next morning to awaken her.\\nShe found her already up and sitting by the window, and there was\\nno indication that she had removed her dress. This was reduced to a\\ncertainty when she went into the adjoining apartment and found the\\ncouch just as it had been the previous evening.\\n\\nShe went back to where young Mrs. Mallard was sitting, and laid her\\nhand gently upon the girl\\'s arm.\\n\\n\"I hope you will be happy with us here, my dear,\" she said in her\\nsweet, gentle old voice, \"for we will do everything to serve you. I\\nhave been here for many years and have witnessed the home-coming of\\nmany of the brides of the Mallards. There was never one that I took to\\nmore than I did to you, my dear child. I felt like taking you in my\\narms and pressing you to my heart. But you seem lonely. Tell me, is\\nthere anything I can do for you?\"\\n\\nIda lifted her face.\\n\\n\"You are very, very kind,\" she said, gratefully, \"and I thank you with\\nall my heart.\"\\n\\nShe looked as if she were about to add something, but quickly checked\\nherself.\\n\\n\"Perhaps you would like to see the grounds, my dear,\" said Mrs. Rice.\\n\"Will you come out into the garden?\"\\n\\nThe young woman acquiesced readily enough.\\n\\n\"Your trunks have not come yet, my dear,\" said Mrs. Rice, as they\\nwalked along. \"The railway service in this part of the country is\\nabominable. It looks strange to have you come down to breakfast in your\\ntraveling-dress, but--\"\\n\\n\"I have no trunks coming. This is the only dress I have to wear at\\npresent,\" returned the girl, quietly.\\n\\nIt was as much as the old housekeeper could do to restrain herself from\\nan exclamation of astonishment at this announcement.\\n\\nWhat could it mean? Why had Eugene Mallard\\'s bride no _trousseau_,\\nas he had been preparing for this event for months, as eager in his\\nanticipation of it as a school-boy for a holiday! She could not\\nunderstand it; she felt mystified. But with the quick wit habitual to\\nher, Mrs. Rice replied almost instantly:\\n\\n\"A wardrobe can be easily supplied by our Virginia _modistes_. Indeed,\\nthey are world-famous, I may add. They make dresses for many of the\\nladies of Washington on the shortest notice. Mr. Mallard pressed a roll\\nof bills into my hand when he arrived, and said: \\'See that my wife has\\neverything needful, Mrs. Rice.\\' I could not think what he meant at the\\ntime. Now I see it was your wardrobe he referred to. You and I will set\\nabout getting the things at once. Or if it will fatigue you too much\\nafter your journey, you leave it to me, and I will see that you have a\\ncomplete wardrobe in a short time. You must not say no, my dear; for\\nremember, it is your husband\\'s wish, and you surely wish to please him.\"\\n\\nThe girl looked at her with the strangest expression in her dark eyes.\\n\\n\"Nothing that I could do would please him,\" she said, hopelessly.\\n\\nMrs. Rice did not tell that remark to the servants, or there would have\\nbeen no end of gossip among them.\\n\\n\"There is some great mystery between Eugene Mallard and his bride,\" she\\nsaid to herself. \"I will not attempt to probe into the mystery, but I\\nwill endeavor to bring them together, if it lies within human power.\"\\n\\nThe fortnight that followed, the old mansion was fairly alive with\\nguests coming and going.\\n\\nEugene Mallard could not help but admire Ida for bearing up so bravely\\nunder the terrible ordeal. During that fortnight a strange thing\\nhappened--the cruelest blow that Heaven could have dealt Ida. The\\nlovely girl had learned to love Eugene Mallard with all the strength of\\nher nature. She was in love with him, and he was cold and indifferent.\\n\\nAnother fortnight passed, and yet another. Everything at the great\\nmansion passed pleasantly enough to the outside world. But the young\\ngirls for miles around who envied the young bride never dreamed of the\\nskeleton that existed in that magnificent mansion.\\n\\nEugene Mallard was all that was kind and considerate. It seemed a\\nnecessity to him to have the house full of company. He was never alone\\nwith Ida. How gayly he talked to his guests! Looking at him, Ida said\\nto herself:\\n\\n\"If he would but smile so when he speaks to me! His eyes are always\\ncold; no warmth or brightness ever comes into them for me.\"\\n\\nAlthough Eugene Mallard appeared so bright and gay before his guests;\\nyet, unknown to any one, his heart was filled with the bitterness of\\ndeath. It did not seem possible for him to live through the hours day\\nafter day. He felt thankful to Heaven that no one guessed that he had\\nbrought home a different bride from what he had intended. He dashed\\nrecklessly from one gayety to another, his object being to try to\\nforget Hildegarde, his love. He never voluntarily looked at the girl he\\nhad married.\\n\\nAt the end of six weeks most of the guests returned to their homes, and\\nEugene Mallard suddenly found himself alone with his young wife and the\\nservants.\\n\\n\"I must not let this happen again,\" he said. \"To live here alone\\nrequires more strength than I am possessed of.\"\\n\\nThey breakfasted alone in the great oak dining-room, and each felt the\\nrestraint which they could illy conceal.\\n\\nAs she took her place at the table she was perfectly calm and\\nself-possessed, but the mask of smiles she had worn before his guests\\nfell from her face. She did not attempt any conversation with him, but\\nwith a quick, flashing smile she answered when she was spoken to.\\n\\n\"It seems to take the servants exceptionally long to serve breakfast,\"\\nhe said, impatiently; adding: \"Will you permit me to glance over the\\nmorning paper? I am interested in this column on stocks.\"\\n\\nShe bowed her head gracefully, and watched him, as he read in silence.\\nThere came over her face an air of sadness painful to see in one so\\nyoung.\\n\\nTo Ida the departure of the company was a great relief. Indeed, she\\nlonged for solitude, and thought that if they did not go soon she could\\nnot keep up much longer.\\n\\nShe had wanted to go away long ago; but she had remained there, and now\\nthe attraction was so great that she would not break away even if she\\ncould. Her love for her husband was like a magnet, strong as her very\\nlife-blood, a part of every heart-beat.\\n\\nFor long hours she would muse over her strange position.\\n\\nIt was an uncommon fate--young, with life all before her, she longed\\nfor its blessings. It was pitiful for her to know that the man she had\\nlearned to love cared for another, that she was no more to her husband\\nthan she would be to a brother.\\n\\nHow sad it was that she should long for the love of her husband as\\nshe had never longed for anything else in life! It seemed so strange\\nto live in that magnificent home, to have everything that her heart\\ndesired, to be wealthy, honored, and envied, yet to have no husband\\'s\\nlove.\\n\\nDid he still sigh for Hildegarde? Was he thinking of her when that\\ndreamy look came into his eyes? She would give the world to know. She\\nfelt a terrible jealousy in her heart.\\n\\n\"Will he never change?\" she asked herself, in despair. \"Living under\\nthe same roof with me, seeing me day after day, will his heart never\\nwarm ever so little toward me?\"\\n\\nOnce more the old resolve, to steal away from the house, came to her.\\nShould she go to him, kneel at his feet, and sob out:\\n\\n\"I can not remain in this house any longer, because I--I--have learned\\nto love you.\"\\n\\nShe could picture the surprise on his face. Perhaps there would be\\nanger, scorn. The eagle dared to look at the sun, the worm dared to\\ncreep into the tender heart of the rose. Was it strange that she had\\ndared to love him?\\n\\nHers was a dreary fate, and she tried to bear it bravely. If she had\\nonly some one to confide in, some one to talk to! Was his heart dead\\nbecause of his bitter disappointment?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\\n\\n\\nOne morning Eugene Mallard informed his young wife at the\\nbreakfast-table that he had invited a party of friends from the\\nadjoining city, and had just received word that they would be with them\\nthat day. This was sorrowful news to Ida, for she realized that she\\nwould see less of her husband when they came. But he seemed to await\\ntheir arrival in a fever of impatience.\\n\\nWhile she was wondering how many there would be in the party, her\\nhusband said, as if in answer to the unexpressed thought:\\n\\n\"There will be six in the party--Mrs. Staples and her two daughters,\\nDora and Louisa, Captain Drury, Arthur Hollis, and--and Vivian Deane.\"\\n\\nIda looked up quickly as her husband pronounced the last name. Was it\\nonly her fancy, or did he turn away abruptly?\\n\\nSomehow she could not rid herself of the fancy.\\n\\nThen suddenly it occurred to her that she had heard the name, Vivian\\nDeane, before. She remembered the conversation well.\\n\\nWhile their former guests were there, she had been sitting in the\\nrose-embowered veranda one day, while two of them passed on the lawn,\\nand the fragments of their conversation floated up to her.\\n\\n\"I am surprised to find that Vivian Deane is not here,\" said one.\\n\\n\"Indeed! I would have been more surprised if she had been here,\" said\\nthe other.\\n\\nThey were idle words, almost meaningless, as far as she was concerned,\\nbut the name, Vivian Deane, clung to her for many days afterward. This\\nwas the last morning she would have with her husband. It was generally\\nhis custom to smoke in the grounds after breakfast. If she walked over\\nthe lawn she might be able to have a little chat with him.\\n\\nShe made a tour of the grounds, but to her surprise she did not see\\nEugene Mallard. Perhaps he was detained in the library writing letters.\\nA little brook ran through a far corner of the grounds, and on either\\nside of it tall laurel bushes grew.\\n\\nWould life ever be any different for her? Would fate be always as\\nunkind as now? Bitter tears, which she could not restrain, sprung to\\nher eyes and coursed down her cheeks.\\n\\nShe tried to stop their flow, but she could not, though she realized\\nthat they would be a sorry object before her husband\\'s guests. At that\\nmoment she heard the sound of footsteps.\\n\\nLooking through the bushes she saw two of the servants walking\\nleisurely along, one carrying a basket of newly gathered fruit, and\\nthe other a basket of freshly cut roses.\\n\\nWas it fate that caused one of them to say:\\n\\n\"Let us not return to the house just yet. The morning is warm and fine,\\nwhy not sit down here under the shade of this tree and tie the roses\\ninto bunches? I can do it as well here as in the house.\"\\n\\nWhereupon they leisurely proceeded to seat themselves.\\n\\n\"It isn\\'t the same house since master brought home his bride,\" said the\\nother. \"It\\'s nothing but company, company, all the time. Now we are to\\nhave another new lot of guests.\"\\n\\n\"And guess who is invited _this_ time,\" said her companion.\\n\\n\"Mr. Mallard seems to know everybody in the country, so it would be a\\npretty hard guess,\" laughed the girl.\\n\\n\"Well,\" returned the other, \"as you are not so good at guessing, I may\\nas well tell you--it is Miss Vivian Deane.\"\\n\\n\"Pray, who is _she_?\" asked the girl who was tying the roses.\\n\\n\"Oh, I forgot you were not here long enough to know about her. Well,\\nI will tell you. She is a young girl who lives a few miles away in\\na magnificent house called Deane Castle. She is as beautiful as a\\ndream, and as heartless as she is beautiful. She has a doll-like\\npink-and-white face, big blue eyes, and a wealth of flaxen curls.\\nThough she looks like an angel, a bigger devil in woman\\'s form never\\nlived.\\n\\n\"She was a great favorite with old Eugene Mallard, the uncle, and his\\nfond wish was that his favorite nephew should fall in love with and\\nmarry the pretty girl. But, bless you, the young man had ideas of his\\nown.\"\\n\\n\"Who else is coming?\" was the next question.\\n\\n\"A lady and her two daughters. They used to be dead in love with Mr.\\nMallard, until they found it was useless. They were more sensible,\\nhowever, than Vivian Deane. They turned their attention elsewhere, and\\nthey are still looking for eligible husbands.\"\\n\\nIda May\\'s heart throbbed wildly. Now she knew why her husband\\'s face\\nhad flushed as he mentioned the name of Vivian Deane. And this was the\\nyoung girl whom she was so soon to meet!\\n\\nIda felt nervous at the very thought of the ordeal before her. She knew\\nshe must be in the drawing-room to welcome his guests. Her husband\\nwould expect that of her.\\n\\nDrying her tears, though her heart was heavy indeed, the young wife\\nstole back quietly to the house, and up to her own room. When she had\\nremoved the traces of tears, she looked with pitiful wistfulness at the\\nface which the mirror reflected.\\n\\nHow long would it take this Vivian Deane, who loved her husband so\\nmadly, to discover that he was most unhappy in his marriage?\\n\\nThere was a light tap on the door, and in answer to her \"Come in\" one\\nof the maids entered the room.\\n\\n\"If you please, Mrs. Mallard, your husband would like to have you come\\ndown into the drawing-room. He says the guests are likely to arrive at\\nany moment.\"\\n\\n\"Say that I will be down directly,\" she replied, and her voice sounded\\nso hoarse and unnatural that she feared the girl would notice her\\nemotion.\\n\\n\"Would you like me to help you arrange your toilet, ma\\'am?\" she asked,\\nstill holding the door knob in her hand.\\n\\nHer toilet! she had not thought of it, so deeply had she been engrossed\\nin her thoughts. Yes, she must make every effort to look well, because\\nthe eyes of her rival would be upon her.\\n\\n\"Yes, you may help me if you will,\" she said, wistfully. And when she\\nwas dressed and standing before her mirror, she was so nervous she\\ncould hardly stand. The maid noticed her trembling.\\n\\n\"You are ill, my lady,\" she cried, in alarm; \"your face has grown very\\npale. Do let me bring you a glass of wine!\"\\n\\n\"No,\" replied her young mistress; \"it is only a momentary pain. I will\\nbe better presently.\"\\n\\nAs the maid watched, Ida\\'s face grew from deathly pale to a flushed\\nappearance, and her hands were burning hot.\\n\\n\"I think I must go and see the housekeeper. I am sure Mrs. Mallard is\\nnot fit to receive guests. She is very ill,\" she said to herself.\\n\\n\"If you only felt as well as you looked, my lady,\" said the girl, aloud\\nand admiringly.\\n\\n\"Do you think I look well, Marie?\" she asked, with a pitiful eagerness\\nin her voice.\\n\\n\"Oh, ma\\'am, if I dared speak the truth without being accused of\\nflattery, I would say I never saw any-one so beautiful in all my life!\"\\n\\n\"Do I look more beautiful than Vivian Deane?\" was the question that\\nrose to her lips. But she checked the words just in time. At that\\nmoment another maid tapped at the door, and inquired if her mistress\\nwould soon be down.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" returned Ida. \"I am coming directly.\"\\n\\nAs she uttered the words, she heard the sound of carriage wheels. By a\\ngreat effort, she nerved herself for the ordeal.\\n\\n\"Why, how foolish I am!\" she said, with a nervous little laugh. But\\nsomehow a premonition of coming evil crept over her which she could not\\nshake off.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\\n\\n\\nEugene Mallard did not look up as his young wife entered the room. He\\nwas gazing so steadily out of the window that he did not even hear her\\nlight footsteps. She went up to him timidly. Whatever she was about to\\nsay died away on her lips, for the expression on his face startled\\nher. She had never seen him look so cross before.\\n\\nAt that moment the servant announced: \"Mrs. and the Misses Staples!\"\\n\\nEugene Mallard stepped forward quickly to receive them. How his face\\nlighted up! Was it only her fancy, or did he hold the hand of the\\nprettiest girl a moment longer than was necessary? Then he turned and\\nintroduced them to his young wife. Louisa and Dora Staples looked at\\nher eagerly; she could see great surprise in their faces.\\n\\nWere they disappointed in her? That was the first thought that crossed\\nIda\\'s mind. How was she to know their thoughts? Dora Staples came\\nforward, holding out her hands and blushing like a school-girl. Louisa\\nstood back, gazing in puzzled wonder at the bride.\\n\\n\"We were very sorry that we could not be here to witness your\\nhome-coming and to participate in the grand wedding reception that\\nevery one is talking about even yet. But we were miles and miles away.\"\\n\\nThen the conversation drifted into other channels.\\n\\nA few moments later two gentlemen arrived--Captain Drury and Arthur\\nHollis. Ida remembered them well; they had been to the reception. The\\ntwo girls were delighted at this acquisition to the party, and in a\\nfew moments Dora Staples had captured the dashing captain for a chat,\\nleaving Arthur Hollis for her sister Louisa.\\n\\nBut Mr. Hollis was not in a mood to enjoy the senseless chatter of Miss\\nLouisa Staples, for whom he inwardly felt a cordial dislike.\\n\\nOn the pretense of wishing to smoke a cigar, especially as her mother\\nand Mrs. Mallard had joined the group, he begged her to excuse him for\\na little while. He saw his host on the terrace, and stepped out of the\\nlong French window, and went at once to where he stood.\\n\\n\"I congratulate you upon the rare beauty of your wife,\" he said,\\ntouching him familiarly upon the arm. \"I thought her exceedingly\\npretty the first time I saw her; she has grown more beautiful since.\"\\n\\n\"I really ought to be obliged to you for the compliment,\" returned\\nEugene Mallard, laughingly.\\n\\n\"You ought to love her very much, for she is worth loving,\" said Arthur\\nHollis, bluntly, as he knocked the ashes from his cigar.\\n\\n\"Has any one told you that I do not?\" asked Mallard, quickly.\\n\\n\"No, certainly not; but she does not look happy,\" returned Hollis,\\nthoughtfully. \"As a friend of many years\\' standing, I feel myself\\nprivileged to speak without reserve to you, my old comrade. Forgive\\nme for saying that though your bride\\'s eyes ought to be filled with\\nsunshine, they are noticeably sad and dreary. Hers is not a happy face,\\nEugene.\"\\n\\nMr. Mallard frowned. He had heard quite enough of this topic. His\\nwife\\'s face did not interest him. Arthur Hollis had been his friend for\\nlong years; they had been chums from childhood. Suddenly Eugene turned\\nand laid his hand on Arthur Hollis\\'s shoulder.\\n\\n\"I have a strange explanation to make to you,\" he said in a voice husky\\nwith emotion. \"Your keen eyes have discovered, Hollis, what I would\\nfain have kept from you. A full confession is good for the soul, they\\nsay, and I will tell you this much, Arthur: the girl whom I told you\\nso much about, is not the one whom I have married. At the altar, in a\\ndimly lighted church, this girl took the place of the one whom I was\\nto wed, and I did not find it out until we had been pronounced man and\\nwife.\"\\n\\nHollis could not have been more completely astounded if a volcano had\\nopened at his feet.\\n\\nEugene Mallard had to repeat his words before Hollis could grasp the\\nwhole meaning of what he had heard.\\n\\n\"You must not think that I wronged her in any way, that she had any\\nclaim upon me,\" went on Eugene Mallard, huskily. \"Do not judge me too\\nhastily. It all came about through a mistake. She--she--mistook me for\\nRoyal Ainsley, my cousin, and hearing that I was to be married, came\\nthere, and--and, by the aid of a woman, succeeded in becoming my bride.\\nAnd now, because of it, three lives are ruined. I am trying to make\\nthe best of it, but it seems, at times, as though I will not be able\\nto bear up under it--my whole heart belonging to one woman, while I am\\nwedded to another.\"\\n\\n\"Great heavens!\" exclaimed Hollis. \"I did not dream of such a state of\\naffairs!\"\\n\\n\"She is my wife in name only,\" added Eugene Mallard, bitterly. \"I do\\nnot know what the future will bring forth. I can only say that I am\\ntrying to live it out as best I can. My life is full of wretchedness,\\nand I can not see what will be the end of it all.\"\\n\\nNow Arthur Hollis could readily understand the brooding look in Ida\\'s\\neyes. Why she was graver, more thoughtful, more abstracted than when he\\nhad seen her last.\\n\\nWhile they were talking, another carriage drove up.\\n\\nThey saw a beautiful face at the window.\\n\\n\"It is Vivian Deane,\" said Mr. Mallard.\\n\\nHollis looked surprised.\\n\\n\"I hope, my dear boy,\" he said in a tone of jest, beneath which was\\ncertainly a vein of earnestness, \"that Miss Deane has got over her mad\\ninfatuation for you, now that she knows you are married!\"\\n\\nMr. Mallard looked thoughtful.\\n\\n\"I suppose you are wondering why I invited her here,\" he said, slowly,\\n\"and I may as well tell you the truth, that you will not for a moment\\nimagine I sent for her to indulge in a flirtation. Miss Deane wrote me\\nthat she was coming to pay my wife a fortnight\\'s visit, so what could I\\ndo. Without waiting to receive a reply from me, here she is. You will\\ncome with me, and welcome her?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" said Hollis, understanding Eugene\\'s position.\\n\\nMiss Deane looked exceedingly annoyed as the two men approached.\\n\\nShe had calculated upon meeting Eugene alone. She meant to tell him\\nin a few words that her life was ruined because of his marriage. Now\\nshe could only exchange the merest formal greeting. Biting her red lips\\nfiercely, and forcing a smile to them, she held out her hand.\\n\\n\"I am so delighted at seeing you again, Mr. Mallard,\" she declared,\\ngiving Hollis a stiff, haughty bow.\\n\\nEugene assisted her from the carriage and avoided looking at her as\\nmuch as possible--a fact which annoyed her exceedingly.\\n\\n\"And I am so anxious to see your bride,\" she continued.\\n\\nEugene could readily understand that, and so could Hollis.\\n\\nHollis followed his friend to the drawing-room. He stood by the young\\nbride\\'s side when Vivian Deane was presented to her.\\n\\nHe had expected to see an expression of bitter dislike on the doll-like\\npink-and-white face. He was surprised and relieved to see Vivian hold\\nout her little hands and murmur in her cooing voice:\\n\\n\"I am so delighted to see you, Mrs. Mallard, I am sure we shall be\\nfriends.\"\\n\\nIda gazed anxiously, wistfully, into the pink-and-white face. Vivian\\'s\\nsea-blue eyes met her gaze unflinchingly; her red lips, which suggested\\nmore of art than nature, wore a mask of the sweetest smiles.\\n\\nThe young bride drew a deep breath of relief. She had been\\nunnecessarily frightened, she told herself. Now that Vivian knew\\nEugene was married, she had in all probability resigned herself to the\\ninevitable.\\n\\n\"Probably she has another lover by this time, and thinks no more of\\nEugene,\" thought Ida.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXV.\\n\\n\\nAlone in her room, Vivian Deane stood before her mirror and critically\\nviewed the face reflected in it.\\n\\n\"I am more beautiful than Eugene Mallard\\'s wife,\" she cried, nodding\\napprovingly to the dimpled, smiling face, \"and I will make that beauty\\ntell. He does not look happy,\" she mused. \"I, who know him so well, can\\nsee it. He has married her, but he is dissatisfied. There is something\\namiss between them. Ere I have been in this house a week, I will\\ndiscover what it is.\" She nodded to the reflection in the mirror. \"I\\nhad hoped that, seeing him married, I could steel my heart against him,\\nbut I find I can not.\"\\n\\n\"There is something connected with the manner in which Eugene Mallard\\nfirst met his wife that I must find out,\" was Vivian\\'s mental comment.\\n\\nIt was not long before Vivian discovered that her beautiful young\\nhostess knew almost nothing of music.\\n\\n\"I think I have discovered her secret,\" she said to herself. \"She must\\nhave been a poor girl, perhaps a working-girl.\"\\n\\nInstead of seeing the wisdom of God in such an alliance, whereby the\\nwealthy might share with the poor the gifts God had showered upon them,\\nshe was angrier than ever.\\n\\nFrom the hour in which she had asked Ida the question concerning her\\nmeeting with Eugene Mallard, the young wife avoided being alone with\\nher guest.\\n\\nVivian could not help but notice it, and she smiled to herself. She\\nseemed to have no wish to capture handsome Captain Drury or Arthur\\nHollis. She preferred to talk to her hostess on each and every occasion.\\n\\n\"Yon have not told me,\" she said one day, \"whether you lived in New\\nYork, San Francisco or Boston.\"\\n\\n\"Most of my life was spent in a little village outside of the great\\nmetropolis,\" said Ida, inwardly hoping the inquisitive girl would not\\nthink of asking the name of the village.\\n\\nVivian did think of it, but concluded that it would be wisest not to\\npursue her inquiries too ardently.\\n\\n\"All this ought to have been mine,\" muttered Vivian, clinching her\\nhands tightly--\"all mine! I loved him first, and I loved him best. She\\nhad no right to take him from me!\"\\n\\nThese thoughts often ran through Vivian\\'s mind while Ida was talking to\\nher, believing she was entertaining the best and truest friend she had\\nin the great cruel world.\\n\\nIf the young wife had known her as she really was, she would have\\nturned in utter loathing from the beautiful pink-and-white face; she\\nwould have prayed Heaven to save her from this, her greatest foe.\\n\\nAs it was, she saw only Vivian Deane\\'s beauty and grace. She heard only\\nkindness in her voice, and she thought to herself that she was very\\nfortunate indeed in securing such a friend.\\n\\nShe talked and laughed so happily that the poor young wife almost\\nforgot her sorrow while listening to her.\\n\\nVivian wondered if by any chance the young bride had found out how\\ndesperately she had been in love with her husband in other days.\\n\\nThe young wife became more and more unhappy day by day. Once, in\\nfollowing the windings of a brook, Ida was startled at finding herself\\nseveral miles from home. Glancing up with a start, she found that the\\nsun had almost reached its height. She had been gone longer than she\\nhad intended.\\n\\nPerhaps there was some way by which she could take a shorter cut to\\nthe house. She saw a woman slowly advancing along the path, carrying a\\nlittle baby in her arms. She stopped short as the woman approached. She\\nrecognized her as the wife of one of the village merchants.\\n\\nIda had often seen her driving on the road with her husband, holding\\nthe little child in her lap, and she had said to herself, as she\\nturned away to hide the tears that would spring to her eyes: \"That\\nwoman has everything in the world to make her life happy. I would\\nexchange places with her gladly if I could.\"\\n\\nThe woman smiled as she saw Eugene Mallard\\'s young wife, and appeared\\nannoyed upon observing that she was about to stop and speak to her. She\\nanswered her question readily enough, and pointed out the way, a short\\ncut over the meadows, that would bring her near her home. Still Ida\\nlingered, looking wistfully at the young mother.\\n\\n\"I have often seen you, from my window, rambling by the brook-side. You\\nmust be very fond of out-door life,\" said Ida.\\n\\n\"I do love the sunshine,\" replied the young woman; \"but I do not come\\nout for it only for myself, but for baby\\'s sake also.\"\\n\\nA great, sudden thrill that made her soul grow faint and dizzy filled\\nIda\\'s whole being as her gaze rested on the babe she carried. She\\nthought of that other one, in a nameless grave, sleeping under the\\ndaisies. It would have been just about the age of this little one had\\nit lived.\\n\\n\"How happy you must be!\" sighed Ida.\\n\\n\"We are not always what we seem,\" replied the woman, with a sigh. \"I\\nlove this little thing very dearly, but it is not my own child. I had a\\nlittle one whom I loved better than my life,\" went on the woman, sadly.\\n\"When it died, I refused to be comforted. I took on so that my husband\\ngrew frightened.\\n\\n\"\\'Don\\'t fret, Margaret,\\' he said; \\'I will find a way to comfort you.\\'\\n\\n\"He sent to some foundling asylum in the great city, and this little\\none was brought to me to fill the aching void in my heart. I love it\\nvery dearly, but oh! it can never take the place of the one I lost.\"\\n\\nEugene Mallard\\'s wife was looking at it with her soul in her eyes.\\n\\n\"Poor little waif!\" she sighed; \"it was very fortunate in securing a\\nhome with you.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, Mrs. Mallard,\" said the woman. \"We are poor and plain\\npeople, but we will do what we can for the poor little thing.\"\\n\\nShe was about to pass on, thinking she had taken up too much of the\\nlady\\'s time with her story.\\n\\nSuddenly Ida turned, her beautiful dark eyes heavy with tears.\\n\\n\"Would you mind letting me hold the baby for just one minute?\" she\\nasked, wistfully.\\n\\n\"No, certainly not,\" replied the woman, with a pleasant smile.\\n\\nAgain that thrill which she could hardly define shot through her as she\\nreceived the babe from the woman\\'s arms. She bent her face over the\\nlittle rose-leaf one that lay upon her breast. Her lips moved, but no\\nsound came from them.\\n\\nIt seemed to rend her very heart-strings to relinquish her hold of the\\ninfant--to hand it back to the woman who waited to receive it. The\\nmoments seemed to fly by on golden wings.\\n\\nIt seemed to Ida that she could stand there for long hours looking\\ndown into that lovely little face and those two great starry eyes\\nthat looked up wonderingly into her own. It cost her a great pang to\\nhand the child back to the woman. But time was fleeting. She could\\nnot remain there longer, for the distant bells of the village were\\nalready ringing, proclaiming the noonday hour, and she must go home, or\\nluncheon would be kept waiting.\\n\\n\"You come here often?\" she asked, turning again to the woman.\\n\\n\"Almost every day,\" was the reply.\\n\\nThe hapless young wife made up her mind that she would see them often.\\nActing upon a sudden impulse, she took out her purse and handed the\\nwoman a golden coin.\\n\\n\"Take that for the little one,\" she said. \"What is its name?\"\\n\\n\"We haven\\'t decided upon its name yet,\" returned the woman; \"we have\\nonly had the child a few weeks.\"\\n\\n\"Would you think over it if I suggested a name?\" asked Ida, wistfully.\\n\\n\"Yes, indeed,\" replied the woman. \"You may be sure I would.\"\\n\\n\"Why not call her \\'Ida May\\'?\" murmured the young wife, with her whole\\nheart and soul in her eyes.\\n\\n\"That is a beautiful name,\" cried the woman--\"Ida May Lester. That is\\nwhat it shall be!\"\\n\\nSomehow the naming of the poor waif gave to the hapless young wife a\\ngreat relief.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\\n\\n\\nIda wended her way over the flower-strewn meadow, with her heart\\nbeating more wildly than it had ever beaten before. She could not\\nforget the flower-like little infant that had looked up into her face,\\nand which had so strangely affected her.\\n\\nEven the guests noted her heightened color; and Vivian Deane, watching\\nher narrowly from across the table, wondered what brought the\\nbrightness to her eyes.\\n\\nShe looked at Eugene Mallard with intense interest. Surely there was\\nno corresponding gladness in his eyes. Indeed, he looked unusually\\ncareworn.\\n\\n\"I will soon find out what has happened,\" said Vivian, with a pang of\\nbitter jealousy.\\n\\nA little later Vivian sought Ida in her _boudoir_.\\n\\n\"It has commenced to rain,\" she said, \"and I am at a loss to know\\nwhat to do with myself. The Staples girls have gone to their rooms to\\nrest, and their mother wearies me talking about Christian charity. The\\ngentlemen have repaired to the smoking-room, and so I have sought you.\"\\n\\n\"You are very welcome,\" said Ida. \"I will do my best to amuse you.\"\\n\\nAs she looked at Vivian, she said to herself:\\n\\n\"How foolish I have been to imagine that this brilliant, beautiful girl\\nshould care for a man who belonged to another girl.\"\\n\\nVivian had a very fascinating way when among women, and now she exerted\\nherself to please Eugene Mallard\\'s young wife as she had never exerted\\nherself to please any one before.\\n\\n\"What a very cozy _boudoir_ you have, Ida!\" she said. \"It is like a\\ncasket for some precious jewel. How considerate your husband was to\\nhave it furnished to suit your rich dark beauty. I used to think that\\nnothing was pretty except white and gold or blue and white.\"\\n\\n\"That is only natural,\" returned Ida. \"You are a pronounced blonde, you\\nknow.\"\\n\\n\"Then you do not agree with me that there is a possibility of blondes\\nliking rich dark surroundings?\"\\n\\n\"No; I should not fancy so,\" returned Ida, \"except that blondes usually\\nfall in love with dark men.\"\\n\\nVivian flushed a vivid scarlet, which Ida did not see, for at that\\nmoment Vivian\\'s face was turned from her.\\n\\n\"Yes, that is very true,\" returned Vivian, making an effort to control\\nher emotion.\\n\\nIn her case, Vivian knew that the old saying was at fault. The strong,\\npassionate love of her heart had gone out to Eugene Mallard, and he was\\nfair. He was her ideal of manly beauty. The faces of other men appeared\\nquite insignificant when compared to his. She was anxious to turn the\\nconversation into another channel.\\n\\n\"I have often thought, amid all this gayety, how lonely you must be at\\ntimes without some girl friend to talk matters over with you,\" said\\nVivian.\\n\\n\"You are quite right,\" said Ida, eagerly. \"I _do_ need a girl friend,\\nsome one of my own age, to whom I could open my heart.\"\\n\\nVivian glided up to her and threw her arms about her neck.\\n\\n\"Let me be that friend,\" she whispered, eagerly.\\n\\nThe young wife looked at her wistfully; her cheeks flushed.\\n\\n\"I shall be only too glad, Vivian,\" Ida said.\\n\\n\"If she had heard that I was in love with her husband, I must first\\nthrow her off the track,\" thought Vivian.\\n\\n\"I am going to tell you a secret,\" she murmured, aloud; \"but you must\\nnot reveal it to any one, I have had a strange love affair, Ida.\"\\n\\nShe felt the young wife start, her figure tremble; she saw the lovely\\nface grow pale. But not appearing to notice her agitation, she went on:\\n\\n\"My hero is as dark as a Spanish knight. I met him recently. It was a\\ncase of love at first sight. He proposed to me within a fortnight. But\\nmy relatives do not like him, wealthy, handsome, courteous though he\\nis. They have forbidden him the house, yet I think in time they will\\novercome their objections.\"\\n\\nShe could plainly see how her fictitious story relieved the young\\nwife. The color came back to Ida\\'s cheeks, the light to her eyes. She\\nthrew her arms impulsively about Vivian, and kissed her fair, lovely,\\ntreacherous face.\\n\\n\"You are indeed to be envied, Vivian,\" she said, earnestly. \"To love\\nand be loved is the greatest happiness God can give any one. I hope,\\nfor _your_ sake, that your lover may win his way to the hearts of your\\nrelatives. But you know that the course of true love never did run\\nsmoothly.\"\\n\\n\"My lover is a great friend of your husband\\'s, and perhaps he has told\\nyou about it?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Ida. \"I assure you that Mr. Mallard has not spoken to me on\\nthe subject,\" and she looked very discomforted.\\n\\n\"I am sure your husband must have received a letter from my lover and\\nhidden it away somewhere. Won\\'t you be so kind as to look thoroughly\\nthrough his desk, and see?\" asked Vivian.\\n\\nIda drew back in alarm.\\n\\n\"Oh, I could do not do what you ask. Mr. Mallard\\'s rooms are in another\\npart of the house,\" Ida answered, thoughtlessly.\\n\\nIda now realized the importance of the admission she had thoughtlessly\\nmade. But she could not recall her words--it was too late.\\n\\nVivian looked astounded. This was a state of affairs of which she had\\nnever dreamed. Her idea had been to find some pretext to look through\\nEugene Mallard\\'s desk, and to abstract all the notes she had written to\\nhim.\\n\\nShe remembered one or two which she had written in which she had poured\\nout her love for him in a mad fashion, and she would not like any one\\nto come across them.\\n\\nBut here she had unearthed a startling surprise. Eugene Mallard\\'s rooms\\nwere in another part of the house. Then they were indeed estranged. She\\nmust find out the secret that lay between them.\\n\\n\"I am so sorry to have unearthed so sad a secret,\" cried the false\\nfriend, winding her arms more tightly about Ida, and turning her face\\naway, that the young wife might not observe the look of triumph in it.\\n\"But every life has its sorrow, and perhaps it was meant that I should\\ncomfort you. If you are wearing out your heart longing for the sympathy\\nof a true friend, oh, dear Ida, please do confide in me, and let me\\nhelp you!\"\\n\\nThe words had such a ring of sympathy in them that it was no wonder the\\nyoung wife believed her. She was young and unversed in the ways of the\\nworld, or this beautiful false friend could not have deceived her so.\\n\\n\"Oh, Vivian, I _am_ unhappy,\" she sobbed, \"surely the most unhappy girl\\nthe sun ever shone on! I must make a confidant of some one--tell some\\none my troubles, or I shall die. My--my husband does not love me!\"\\n\\n\"Does not love you!\" repeated Vivian. \"Then why on earth did he marry\\nyou?\"\\n\\nThe hapless young wife could find no answer to that question; her head\\ndrooped, and her lips were dumb.\\n\\n\"I am so glad you told me this,\" said Vivian; and it was strange that\\nIda did not notice the ring of triumph in the voice of her false friend\\nas she said: \"I will do my best to bring you two together. I do not ask\\nwhich one is at fault. Both can not be entirely blameless.\"\\n\\n\"There is a shadow between us which never can be lifted,\" sobbed the\\nyoung wife, putting her head on Vivian\\'s shoulder. \"There is love on\\nonly one side,\" went on Ida, despairingly. \"He is indifferent to me,\\nand--and he will grow to hate me.\"\\n\\n\"Forgive me, please, if I have been so engrossed in my own love affair\\nthat I did not notice anything was amiss between my old friend Eugene\\nand his fair young bride.\"\\n\\n\"I almost dread to think of the future,\" moaned the young wife. \"There\\nare times when I give myself up to wondering over the strange problems\\nof life, and I ask myself why I, who should be happy, find the world so\\ndark and dreary.\"\\n\\n\"You must be very patient,\" said Vivian, \"and above all things,\\nlet me warn you against being the first to make overtures for a\\nreconciliation.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I am so very, very glad that I have had this talk with you,\"\\nsobbed Ida, \"for during the past week I had come to the conclusion that\\nthe very first time I found my husband in the library, I would go up\\nto him, and say; \\'This kind of life is killing me. It would be better\\nfar for you to plunge a knife in my breast and kill me. Either take\\nme to your heart, either make me your wife in fact as well as name,\\nor send me out into the coldness and bitterness of the world. I can\\nendure this no longer. Your friends crowd about me, thinking I am the\\nhappiest person in the world, while I am the most miserable. I must go\\nfrom here, because I have learned to love you, my husband, with all\\nmy heart and soul. You may be surprised to hear this from me, but it\\nis the truth. I love you as no one else ever will. You may live for\\nyears, flattered and happy, but no love like mine will ever come to you\\nagain. Although you married me, yet you do not love me, and never will.\\nAlways remember that the wife who is leaving you loves you with all her\\nheart. I would not tell you this now, but that I know in this world we\\nmay never meet again.\\'\"\\n\\nHer voice died away in a whisper as she uttered the last word, and the\\nfalse friend who had determined to part husband and wife said she had\\nlearned just in time what was necessary to prevent a reconciliation\\nbetween Ida and her husband.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\\n\\n\\nAfter Vivian Deane had learned of the estrangement of Eugene and Ida,\\nshe made up her mind that she would part them forever.\\n\\nBut how? She thought over the matter long and earnestly. She was\\nstanding in the magnificent drawing-room one morning, when Arthur\\nHollis entered.\\n\\n\"How does it happen that you are not out for a canter on horseback with\\nour host and Captain Drury?\" she asked. \"This is such a delightful\\nmorning.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, Miss Deane,\" he replied, laughingly, showing a handsome set of\\nwhite teeth, \"I was just bemoaning that fact. But I had some important\\nletters to write, and I was obliged to remain in my room and finish\\nthem.\"\\n\\nAt that moment they saw their young hostess crossing the lawn. Vivian\\nsaw Arthur Hollis look after her with a long, steady, earnest gaze,\\nuntil she was quite out of their sight.\\n\\n\"Are you admiring our young hostess?\" she asked, suddenly, with\\nsomething like a frown on her face.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he answered, frankly. \"I was just thinking that Mrs. Mallard has\\nthe sweetest face and most charming manner of any woman I ever met.\"\\n\\n\"Then you admire her style of beauty?\" said Vivian, a little piqued.\\n\\n\"Yes, very much,\" said Arthur Hollis. \"If I had met her before she\\nmarried our friend Eugene, I think I should have fallen in love with\\nher myself.\"\\n\\nThe words were innocent enough; but Arthur Hollis never for a moment\\ndreamed of the terrible mischief they were to do in the after years.\\n\\nThose words so simply uttered sent a thrill through the heart of the\\ngirl who listened.\\n\\n\"Ah, I have it!\" she said to herself. \"A way is opened to me at last\\nto part Eugene Mallard and his wife. I will encourage Arthur Hollis\\'s\\nadmiration for the beautiful Ida. Men are easily flattered. There is no\\nknowing what the end will be.\"\\n\\nIt was a plot worthy of a fiend incarnate; but this girl, who loved\\nEugene Mallard, would stop at nothing to gain her end.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\\n\\n\\nDuring the fortnight that followed, Arthur Hollis sunned himself each\\nday more and more in Ida\\'s presence.\\n\\nNo one noticed it save Vivian Deane. He saw no danger, nor did she, in\\ntheir companionship. In the meantime, the shadow darkened and deepened.\\nIt was simply the old story in another form.\\n\\nThey were both young. She was gifted with the sweetest grace that ever\\na woman possessed; he was brave, courteous, and noble, with the first\\nthrob of a mighty passion in his heart.\\n\\nWhat usually happens in such cases? He fell desperately in love with\\nIda.\\n\\nAt first Arthur told himself it was pity for her loneliness that\\nactuated him to be always at her side, to make time pass pleasantly for\\nher. He realized, when it was too late, that pity had deepened into a\\nmighty love. And he told himself, in his despair, as the truth forced\\nitself upon him, that he loved her.\\n\\nThe truth came to him like a great shock. He went to Eugene Mallard,\\nand told him he must go away at once. It would have been better if he\\nhad told him why; but he did not.\\n\\n\"I will not listen to such a thing!\" cried Eugene. \"You have promised\\nto stay until the shooting season, and I will hold you to your word.\"\\n\\nIn vain he pleaded. But Eugene was obdurate.\\n\\n\"There is no good reason for your hurrying away,\" said Eugene.\\n\\n\"Then you want me to stay, no matter what happens?\" replied his friend,\\nquickly.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" replied Eugene Mallard; and he thought of Arthur\\'s words for\\nmany a day afterward.\\n\\nArthur Hollis tried to reason with himself, saying that it was better\\nto go. But he was like the moth, who felt insensibly attracted toward\\nthe flame, drawing nearer and nearer, until, like the moth, he would\\nperish in it.\\n\\nAfter his conversation with Eugene, he proceeded to shut his eyes to\\nthe danger.\\n\\nHe was a free-lance. No woman\\'s face had ever touched his heart before,\\nand he was frightened at the intensity of the love that thrilled his\\nheart for beautiful Ida Mallard.\\n\\nHe would sun himself in her presence for one brief fortnight longer,\\nand then go away. Surely it was not much in a life-time. He would not\\ndeprive himself of the one glimpse of sunshine that had drifted into\\nhis life.\\n\\nEvery day found them together.\\n\\nAlthough Ida did not realize what was in his heart, yet she felt\\nintuitively that there was a great change in Arthur Hollis since he had\\nbeen beneath that roof.\\n\\nAlthough he lingered with his feet on the edge of a precipice, yet\\nhe stood face to face with the truth--he loved at last with all the\\npassionate strength of his heart and nature.\\n\\nHe said to himself that if marriages were made in heaven, she was the\\none woman intended for him; she was the only woman in this world that\\nhe could ever love.\\n\\nIf she had only been free, he would have given her his life, his\\nlove--all that he had on earth to give.\\n\\nTo make the situation all the more pitiful, he knew that she was a\\nwife in name only to the man whose name she bore; that she was as far\\nremoved from him as though she dwelt in an opposite part of the world\\nfrom him.\\n\\nShe was so young, so unhappy, he pitied her with all his heart. He was\\nperplexed, agitated.\\n\\nHow he enjoyed the rambles, the rides with her! The sweetest moment of\\nhis life was when he could steal upon her unawares.\\n\\nHe saw no danger, and in the meantime the shadow darkened and deepened.\\nVivian Deane watched them with exultant eyes.\\n\\n\"It will end in an elopement,\" she told herself, triumphantly. \"Their\\nhearts are drifting nearer and nearer together, and the end is not far\\noff.\"\\n\\nEvery day seemed to make Ida more cold and careless, and to leave an\\nadded sternness upon the face of Eugene Mallard, and a harshness in his\\nvoice.\\n\\nHis marriage had been a bitter regret. It was an effort now to even\\nkeep up appearances. He had sealed his misery. There were times when he\\nwished fiercely, miserably, that he could sever that most unhappy bond\\nand set her free.\\n\\nNot all the wealth and luxury and the army of obsequious servants\\ncould make the grand old mansion a home in its true sense.\\n\\nThe young wife plunged into a ceaseless round of frivolity with a\\nreckless _abandon_ quite foreign to her nature.\\n\\nShe accepted every invitation that came to her, and gave in return a\\nseries of entertainments of so extravagant and magnificent a character\\nthat the people around opened their eyes in astonishment, and whispered\\nit was well that Eugene Mallard\\'s pocket was a deep one.\\n\\nBut before long they found something else to comment upon. Wherever\\nIda went, whether she went abroad or entertained at home, at dinner,\\nball, assembly, there, always closely in her train, might be seen the\\nhandsome Arthur Hollis.\\n\\nGossip began to circulate, slight and vague at first, but it soon\\nbecame plainly hinted that Eugene Mallard\\'s beautiful young wife\\nwas flirting with Arthur Hollis--flirting defiantly, desperately,\\nrecklessly. People wondered in indignant astonishment if her husband\\nwas blind or mad.\\n\\nAlmost everybody was discussing the piquant scandal. Even those who had\\nbeen her guests found something to say, declaring that they had noticed\\nit from the first, adding this or that detail as the occasion prompted.\\n\\nThey wondered why some one did not drop a hint to the husband.\\nUnsuspicious by nature, and disregarding the formal calls of society\\nwhenever he could possibly do so, he very seldom accompanied his wife\\non the rounds of gayety on which she had embarked. For weeks neither\\nsignificant words nor glances came to him.\\n\\nBut he did hear of it at last, and then the blow struck him with\\nterrible effect. It was only a few sentences spoken by a couple of\\nladies, and pointed with a venom which only a woman\\'s tongue can give,\\ncoupling the name of his wife with that of Arthur Hollis.\\n\\nBut the import of their words was unmistakable, and the shock seemed\\nmomentarily to stop the young man\\'s breath. The two scandal-mongers\\nlingered over their gossip with keen delight, not knowing that they\\nwere overheard. It was at a garden-party given by Ida. Eugene Mallard\\nhad gone into the grounds to enjoy a cigar in a favorite little retreat\\nwhich few of the guests had as yet discovered. He did not care for the\\ndancing on the lawn, and could not be induced to join the dancers.\\n\\nHidden by a group of laurel-bushes, Eugene\\'s quick ear caught the words\\nof two young girls walking slowly down the path.\\n\\n\"Have you seen our hostess, young Mrs. Mallard?\" asked one of the\\nother. \"I have been searching for her everywhere.\"\\n\\n\"Look for handsome Arthur Hollis,\" returned her companion. \"You will\\nsurely find her with him.\"\\n\\nThe rest of the sentence was uttered in a whisper, but Eugene Mallard\\nheard every word of it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\\n\\n\\nEugene Mallard flung down the cigar which he had just lighted as soon\\nas the girls passed, and made his way from the place.\\n\\nHe resisted the impulse to turn fiercely upon them and demand how they\\ndared to speak of his young wife in that manner. It required all his\\nstrength of will to keep down his anger.\\n\\nHe passed the two girls on the path a moment later, and though they\\ngave a start, they believed that he had not heard their remarks, for he\\ndid not betray his anger in his face.\\n\\nEugene looked about for his wife. His eyes wandered sharply around as\\nhe threaded his way among the dancers. But Ida was not visible.\\n\\nCrossing the lawn, he encountered Vivian Deane and Captain Drury. She\\nwas looking her sweetest in pale-blue summer silk half veiled by white\\nlace and pink rosebuds.\\n\\nHe would have passed them by, with a few forced words of pleasantry,\\nbut Vivian would not have it so.\\n\\n\"You have not danced once this afternoon, Eugene,\" she said; \"and a\\nhost who does his duty should figure in some of the waltzes at least.\\nAre you looking for a partner now? Shall I find you one?\"\\n\\n\"No; thanks, Vivian,\" he answered. \"I am looking for my--my wife. Do\\nyou know where she is?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" returned Vivian. \"I saw her a moment ago. Let me see where it\\nwas. Oh, yes; I remember--down by the clump of oaks. She and Mr. Hollis\\nhad danced four consecutive dances together, and were resting. By the\\nway,\" she added, with a gay little laugh, and something like a pout on\\nher pretty red lips, \"you must tell her not to monopolize Mr. Hollis,\\nEugene. It is too bad of her. It does not give a _single_ girl a fair\\nchance, you know.\"\\n\\nVivian moved away with the captain after giving him that parting shot,\\nand Eugene was not rendered much easier by her last words, although\\nthey were apparently gayly and carelessly spoken.\\n\\nHe walked hurriedly to the further end of the grounds, and there, under\\na huge oak-tree, he caught a glimpse of a filmy white dress.\\n\\nAdvancing, he saw his wife sitting there, with Arthur Hollis beside her.\\n\\nNeither saw him. Ida\\'s eyes were fixed upon a crimson rose she was\\nrecklessly plucking to pieces. She seemed to be hardly heeding her\\ncompanion\\'s words.\\n\\nArthur was leaning back against the oak-tree, looking down at the dark,\\ncurly head, and he was speaking earnestly in a tone hardly above a\\nwhisper.\\n\\nA handsome couple they looked, and surely like nothing so much as\\nlovers.\\n\\nEugene realized this, and a feeling of wrath took possession of him. He\\ndid not love her; in fact, there were times when he told himself that\\nhe hated her with the bitterest kind of hatred; but she bore his name,\\nand she must not be allowed to set the tongues of gossipers wagging.\\n\\nEugene knew that she did not mean anything by receiving the attentions\\nof handsome Arthur Hollis, his friend. She was but a young girl, after\\nall, and she thoughtlessly allowed herself to drift into this most\\nwretched flirtation.\\n\\nHis thoughts went no deeper, no further than that; but that was far\\nenough, and for the sake of her good name, this thoughtless, reckless\\nnonsense must be stopped. He trusted her implicitly, yet he felt a mad,\\nunreasonable rage against the two sitting there.\\n\\nIt was well his will was so strong and his temper so well under\\ncontrol, or he could not have advanced as calmly as he did.\\n\\nIda was dressed in white. It struck him that she looked very beautiful.\\nBut just then her beauty seemed to exasperate and harden her husband\\ntoward her.\\n\\nIda glanced up, and seeing him, started.\\n\\nArthur Hollis appeared a little uncomfortable, but after the first\\nsharp glance, Eugene Mallard did not look at him, feeling that he could\\nnot trust himself to do so. He addressed his wife, looking at her with\\na dark frown on his face.\\n\\n\"Vivian told me you were here,\" he began. \"Are you going to dance the\\nnext set?\"\\n\\nHer face flushed, her hands trembled. Was _he_, her husband, coming to\\nask her to dance with him? His next words showed her how mad she had\\nbeen to cherish such a hope.\\n\\n\"I was going to ask Vivian to dance,\" he said. \"I see there are three\\ncouples standing over there ready to dance. It will require one more\\ncouple to fill up the set.\"\\n\\nWith something like haughty pride, she raised her dark head.\\n\\n\"I shall not dance,\" said Ida, in a cold, bitter voice. \"I am tired.\"\\n\\nArthur Hollis had the grace to laughingly excuse himself. He had been\\nenjoying his _tete-a-tete_, and the sudden appearance of her husband\\non the scene was not welcome. Besides, he had noticed that there was\\nsomething in Eugene Mallard\\'s face which he did not like.\\n\\nArthur Hollis did not speak, and Eugene Mallard waited until he was\\nwell out of hearing. The silence lasted so long that Ida broke it by\\npetulantly saying:\\n\\n\"As I shall not dance this set, would it not be as well for you to find\\nsome one else? The music is just starting.\"\\n\\nHe did not appear to listen to the remark. His eyes were riveted on the\\nlittle satin programme, suspended by a little silver cord at her belt,\\nand he saw the initials of Arthur Hollis written opposite six or eight\\ndances.\\n\\nHis face grew hard, stern, and rigid. Had he been blind not to have\\nnoticed what was going on, when it was so plainly apparent to every one\\nelse?\\n\\n\"I should like to ask something of you,\" he said, pointing to the card.\\n\"I want you to promise me that you will not dance any more with Arthur\\nHollis.\"\\n\\nWith a feeling of mingled rage and pain he saw that Ida turned first\\npale then scarlet. She drew herself up to her full height and looked at\\nhim with a _hauteur_ which she never knew she possessed.\\n\\n\"May I ask why you make such a request?\" she asked, sharply.\\n\\n\"For to-day let it be enough that I make the request. Will you promise\\nme?\"\\n\\nAll the spirit that Ida possessed was up in arms.\\n\\n\"Certainly not,\" Ida responded. \"I would not dream of breaking an\\nengagement for no reason whatever.\"\\n\\nThere was a pause, filled only by the strains of distant music.\\n\\nPaler than usual and with a stern look overspreading his face, Eugene\\nMallard waited for his wife to continue, as she seemed to have\\nsomething more to say.\\n\\n\"If you objected to your friend dancing with me, you--you should have\\nmade the request before the engagements were made.\"\\n\\nHe looked at her angrily, his fair, handsome face flushing.\\n\\n\"A half dozen engagements should not have been made,\" he returned.\\n\"People will certainly comment upon it. They are already whispering of\\nmy friend\\'s attention to you.\"\\n\\nA strange look which he could not analyze crossed the beautiful face.\\n\\n\"You must stop this gossip,\" he went on, \"or I will take measures to do\\nso. I have made a request of you, and shown you why I made it. Will you\\ngrant it--for your own sake?\"\\n\\n\"I refuse!\" she repeated. \"I am sorry that you do not think me capable\\nof protecting my own name--and yours.\"\\n\\nWith something like a muttered imprecation on his lips, he turned on\\nhis heel, and strode rapidly from her side.\\n\\n\"Fool that I was!\" he muttered, clinching his hands together. \"To save\\nher honor I married her. But what does she care for my honor?\"\\n\\nThe breech between them grew wider than ever now.\\n\\nIda danced with Arthur Hollis, and the tongues of the gossips wagged.\\nIf Eugene Mallard heard, he paid no heed. Strange thoughts were passing\\nthrough his mind.\\n\\nAll unmindful of what Eugene Mallard had to say to his wife, Arthur\\nHollis danced with her, and hovered more closely than ever by her side.\\n\\nHe was growing desperate. His stay was drawing to a close. He meant\\nto make the most of the few hours of sunshine and happiness before he\\nturned his back on all that made life worth the living.\\n\\nAt the finish of one of the dances a messenger-boy was seen approaching\\nwith a telegram.\\n\\n\"For Mr. Arthur Hollis,\" he called.\\n\\nMechanically Arthur held out his hand. It was a dispatch requiring his\\nimmediate presence in Baltimore to attend to some urgent business.\\n\\n\"Have you bad news?\" asked Ida, turning to him; for she saw his face\\nhad grown very pale.\\n\\n\"Yes--no,\" he answered, incoherently, a troubled look coming into his\\neyes. \"I must go away.\" He did not look at her as he uttered the words.\\n\"I must go within the hour,\" he said, huskily. \"Come down by the brook\\nwhere we have passed so many happy hours. I should like to say good-bye\\nto you there.\"\\n\\nFor a moment she hesitated; then seeing the sorrowful look on his face,\\nshe quietly allowed him to lead her down the path toward the brook.\\n\\nIn silence they walked through the sunshine, heedless that there were\\ntwo pairs of eyes following them--Vivian Deane\\'s from one part of the\\ngrounds, and Eugene Mallard\\'s from another.\\n\\nVivian turned and followed them. That was the beginning of the tragedy\\nthat darkened three lives.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XL.\\n\\n\\nSlowly Ida and Arthur Hollis walked together over the beautiful green\\nlawn, Vivian Deane creeping like the shadow of fate after them.\\n\\nArthur seated Ida in her favorite nook on the mossy stone. For a moment\\nneither of them spoke; then he suddenly caught her little hand in his.\\nIda did not know why she trembled, why her hand grew cold in his clasp.\\n\\nThere was not a cloud in the blue sky overhead. The cool, sweet breeze\\nshook the rose leaves and scattered them on the grass; the leaves of\\nthe oak-trees stirred on the great boughs. A calm, sweet and solemn in\\nits beauty, stole over them.\\n\\n\"Ida,\" he whispered, hoarsely, \"did ever a great pity fill your heart\\nfor any one? If so, let pity fill it now for me, for I am in need of\\nit.\"\\n\\n\"Why?\" she asked, looking wonderingly up at him.\\n\\n\"How I shall look back to this hour when I am gone!\" he said, brokenly.\\n\\n\"When I am gone!\" The words had a sad murmur in them, like the fall of\\nautumn leaves. They pierced the very heart of the girl who heard them.\\n\\n\"When you are gone?\" she repeated. \"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"I am going away within the hour,\" he said. \"The telegram I received\\ncalls me back to Baltimore by the first train,\" he added.\\n\\nInvoluntarily Ida drew closer to him, her face paling. Suddenly the\\nlight went out of the sun, the glory faded from the blue sky; the music\\nof the birds was hushed, the bitterness of death seemed to have fallen\\nover her heart.\\n\\n\"Going away?\" She repeated the words over and over again, but she could\\nnot realize their meaning.\\n\\n\"I--I have been so happy, I forgot you would have to go away,\" she\\nsaid, slowly.\\n\\n\"I am going down to Central America. I may die of fever and never come\\nback,\" he answered, with passionate pain in his voice. \"If I am spared\\nto return, it may not be for years. I will have passed out of your\\nthoughts by that time. You will have forgotten the pleasant hours we\\nspent together, forgotten our rambles through the sunny hours. You will\\nhave grown into a woman of the world by that time. You have not begun\\nlife yet.\"\\n\\n\"I feel as though I had finished with it,\" she murmured.\\n\\nShe did not try to check the words that came throbbing to her lips.\\n\\n\"I wish you had not come into my life only to go out of it,\" she added,\\nwith passionate pain.\\n\\nHe looked at her, and strong man though he was, his lips trembled. She\\nhad raised her face to his, and she looked so beautiful, so unhappy,\\nthat he turned away with a groan which came from the very depths of his\\nheart.\\n\\nVivian Deane had crept near enough to hear the first words that had\\npassed between them. She knew that he had received a telegram calling\\nhim away. He had either taken Ida Mallard down to the brook-side to say\\ngood-bye, or to urge her to elope with him. Most likely the latter.\\n\\nShe would go and fetch Eugene. He should be a silent witness to the\\nscene; then her vengeance would be complete.\\n\\nShe knew his pride, his temper. She knew he would not raise his voice\\nto utter one word to stay her steps. He would spurn her, he would force\\nher to go.\\n\\nVivian hurried back to the dancers on the lawn. Eugene Mallard was\\nstanding apart from his guests. She glided up to him and laid a little\\nwhite hand upon his arm.\\n\\n\"Eugene,\" she said, in a voice which trembled with excitement, \"I have\\nalways been your true friend. If I saw you in danger, my first impulse\\nwould be to save you. If I saw an enemy pointing a deadly arrow at your\\nheart, I would try to turn it aside. If I saw a dark cloud hanging over\\nyou, my first impulse would be to warn you.\"\\n\\n\"I anticipate what you are going to say, Vivian,\" he broke in, with\\nan expression of annoyance on his face. \"You are going to repeat some\\ngossip to me, and I will say, before you begin, that I do not care to\\nhear it.\"\\n\\n\"If you will not heed the words of warning of one who wishes you well,\\nyou must submit to the jeers of the whole country. I advise you to go\\nto the brook-side, where your wife is saying farewell to Arthur Hollis;\\nor perhaps she is going with him.\"\\n\\nShe saw the look that passed over his face as she turned swiftly and\\nhurried away. He could not have answered her if his life had depended\\nupon it. Glancing back over her shoulder, she saw that he had strolled\\noff in the direction which she had indicated.\\n\\n\"He will catch them making love to each other, and then--Ah, well, we\\nshall see!\"\\n\\nIda and Arthur had walked in silence by the brook, and they stood\\nbeside it for some moments without speaking; then suddenly Arthur\\nHollis turned toward her.\\n\\n\"Say that you will miss me when I am gone,\" he murmured, with emotion.\\n\\n\"You know that I will,\" she answered. \"But for you, my life here would\\nhave been very lonely.\"\\n\\n\"Do you really mean that?\" he asked, quickly.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" she returned, with something very like a sob on her lips.\\n\\nImpetuously he caught the little white hand that hung by her side.\\n\\n\"Those words will linger in my memory until the day I die!\" he cried,\\nhuskily. \"Ida, I am going away. You will never see me in this world\\nagain. I shall never come back.\"\\n\\nShe looked at him with her great dark eyes.\\n\\n\"It breaks my heart to say farewell,\" he continued, huskily, \"for when\\nI leave you, Ida, I go out into the darkness of death.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, do not say that!\" she cried.\\n\\n\"Yes, the hour has come when I must tell you,\" he answered. \"It will\\nease my heart. Only forgive and forget me. Oh, how am I to say good-bye\\nto you?\" he asked, sharply, looking, with desperation in his eyes,\\nat the lovely pale face. \"I have lived under the same roof with you.\\nI have been thrown into your society day by day, yet I have kept my\\nsecret in my own heart. Now I am going away, and I will tell you the\\ntruth--I love you, Ida--I love you!\"\\n\\nHe caught her hands in his, and she was too bewildered and dazed to\\nwithdraw them.\\n\\n\"You must forgive me!\" he cried. \"Have pity on me, if my words do not\\nplease you!\"\\n\\nShe was carried away by his reckless impetuosity, and was too much\\nsurprised to interrupt him. She had not even recovered herself\\nsufficiently to withdraw her hands from his. All she knew, in her\\nbewilderment, was, that he was kneeling upon the grass at her feet,\\nwith his head bent, and that hot, passionate tears were falling from\\nhis eyes.\\n\\n\"I have brought you here because I could not bear the pain any longer.\\nI must speak to you or die. I love you! Ah, Heaven knows how I love\\nyou!\"\\n\\nShe had no power to stop the torrent of words that fell from his lips.\\n\\n\"You will no doubt wonder how I dare say this to you,\" he went on,\\nbrokenly, \"but my answer is--love dares anything. It must express\\nitself in action or words. No mortal can keep it back.\"\\n\\nShe tried to check him, but it was impossible.\\n\\n\"Hush--hush!\" was all she could say.\\n\\n\"I know the gulf that lies between us,\" he went on: \"I realize that it\\ncan never be bridged over. If I had met you first, I feel all would\\nhave ended differently. You would have loved me as I love you. I feel\\nit--I know it.\"\\n\\nAt that moment Eugene Mallard, who had hurried down the path at the\\nsuggestion of Vivian Deane, arrived upon the scene.\\n\\nOnly the tall lilac bushes sheltered him from the two who stood by the\\nbrook-side. For a moment he was horrified at what he saw and heard. He\\nstood fairly rooted to the spot. His first impulse was to dash in upon\\nthem, fling Arthur Hollis to the earth, and beat his very life out.\\n\\nHis next impulse was to rush to the house for his revolver, return with\\nit, and shoot his false friend before his guilty wife\\'s eyes.\\n\\nHe acted upon the latter impulse, turned on his heel, and a moment\\nlater, white as death, he dashed into the house and ran up a rear\\nstair-way to his room.\\n\\nHe did not love the girl who bore his name, but she should learn, even\\nif it were at the cost of a life, what it meant to drag his name, his\\nhonor, through the mire.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLI.\\n\\n\\nAlthough scarcely five minutes had elapsed since Eugene Mallard dashed\\ninto the house in search of his revolver, when he returned to the\\nbrook-side neither his wife nor Arthur Hollis was to be seen.\\n\\nHis rage was so great that he could scarcely contain himself. In his\\npresent state of mind he did not dare return to his guests, lest his\\nemotion should betray him.\\n\\nHe thought they were planning an elopement; but he would nip that in\\nthe bud.\\n\\nThe woman to whom he had given his name should not disgrace him. He\\ndetermined upon that as he hurried up a rear stair-way to his wife\\'s\\napartments to verify his suspicions.\\n\\nTo his utter surprise, as he flung open the door, he saw her sitting\\nby the window. She sprung to her feet, looking at him with widely\\ndistended eyes.\\n\\nIt was the first time that her husband had ever crossed the threshold\\nof her apartments.\\n\\nHe entered the room, closed the door behind him, and stood with folded\\narms before her.\\n\\nHusband and wife looked at each other.\\n\\nIt was he who broke the awful silence. He strode up to her, and seized\\nher wrist in a vise-like grasp.\\n\\n\"There is little use in making a preliminary speech,\" he cried,\\nhoarsely. \"I will come to the point at once!\"\\n\\nHis face was ghastly, his lips trembled with uncontrollable rage.\\n\\nIda, pale, terrified, wondering, gazed at him with undisguised terror\\nin her eyes.\\n\\n\"What is it?\" she gasped.\\n\\n\"You guilty woman!\" cried Eugene Mallard--\"you cruel, guilty woman, I\\nhave interrupted you in your preparation for flight, it seems!\"\\n\\nHis stern face, the anger that shone in his eyes, and the harsh voice\\nfrightened her. She shrunk back as though he had struck her. Her lips\\nparted as though she would speak; but all sound died away on them.\\n\\n\"It is time,\" said Eugene Mallard, \"that we came to a clear\\nunderstanding. In every way you have deceived me! I have been fatally\\nbetrayed! Your shameless flirtation has tarnished my name and lowered\\nmy position! I am ashamed to look men in the face! Where is he?\" he\\ndemanded, looking about him, as though he expected to see Arthur Hollis\\nin the room.\\n\\n\"Down by the brook,\" she faltered.\\n\\nEugene laughed a harsh, satirical laugh.\\n\\n\"He must have seen me coming while he waited there for you, and fled\\nfrom my wrath.\" He turned on his heel. \"I repeat, if you stir from this\\nroom until I give you leave, it will end in a tragedy!\"\\n\\nIn his anger, he did not see that he was trampling under foot a noble\\nheart. If she had been able to calmly explain to him just what had\\noccurred, she might have been saved. She attempted to speak, but he\\nheld up his hand.\\n\\n\"Not one word!\" he cried. \"I will not listen!\"\\n\\nHe turned suddenly, hurried from the room, closed the door after him,\\nand went quickly to his library, where he could be alone.\\n\\nIda, left alone, reeled into the nearest chair. She shook as if in an\\nague; she was cold, and her head reeled. Her keen pain and agony kept\\nher from fainting.\\n\\nShe tried to imagine her future life. What was Eugene Mallard about to\\ndo? Her future was now ruined, sacrificed. Eugene Mallard had been cold\\nand indifferent to her before, now he hated her.\\n\\nHe said she was to remain in that room until he should return. She\\nflung herself face downward upon the floor. He had called her guilty\\nand cruel; he had vented his rage upon her. Her brain was dizzy with\\nthe unusual excitement.\\n\\nWhen Vivian Deane glided into Ida\\'s room to find out what was going on,\\nto see whether Ida had really eloped, she found her in a deep swoon.\\nShe did not call the servants, but set about reviving her herself.\\n\\nIda lay white and still as one dead. Above her bent Vivian Deane,\\nhalf terrified at the result of her work. Very soon her labors were\\nrewarded, and Ida opened her large, dark eyes.\\n\\n\"Vivian--Vivian!\" she murmured, catching at the arms of her false\\nfriend, her teeth chattering.\\n\\nThe blinding tears that now fell from Ida\\'s eyes was a mercy sent\\ndirectly from Heaven, for they saved the hapless young wife from going\\nmad.\\n\\n\"Something has gone wrong with you, my dear,\" said Vivian, in her\\nsweetest, most cooing voice. \"Tell me what it is, Ida, dear. Let me\\nconsole and comfort you.\"\\n\\nAnother fit of sobbing more violent than the first, and Ida threw\\nherself into the arms of her treacherous friend, sobbing out:\\n\\n\"Oh! Vivian, I must tell some one.\"\\n\\nIn a voice that shook with emotion, she proceeded to confide to her\\nenemy what had happened down by the brook-side, adding that her husband\\nhad discovered it in some way, and accused her of encouraging Arthur\\nHollis.\\n\\n\"Even if you had given him encouragement, no one could have blamed\\nyou,\" Vivian said in a soft, purring voice, \"for your husband\\'s neglect\\nhas been noticeable by every one!\"\\n\\n\"But I did not encourage him!\" cried Ida, in agony. \"He was pleasant\\ncompany, but I thought no more of him, even though I spent so much of\\nmy time in his society, than I did of Captain Drury, or any of the\\nother guests beneath this roof. Oh! I do wish I were dead--I do--I do!\"\\n\\nIn this exaggerated feeling of one ill in body and in mind, in a state\\nof nervous tension, a true friend would have shown the unhappy Ida that\\nher position was not so desperate and hopeless as she imagined. Matters\\ncould not, however, be carried to an extremity without an explanation.\\n\\n\"He bid me to remain here until he should return,\" sobbed Ida. \"What do\\nyou suppose he means to do?\"\\n\\n\"Do you really want my honest opinion?\" asked Vivian, with a steely\\nglitter in her blue eyes.\\n\\n\"Yes!\" said the young wife, anxiously, fairly holding her breath in\\nsuspense.\\n\\n\"Well, then, my dear, if you must have it, here it is: I, who know the\\nfierce temper of the Mallards, say to you that I think he intends to\\ncall all the guests here, to openly denounce you before them, and then\\nturn you away from his house!\"\\n\\nThe face of the girl-wife who listened grew ghastly.\\n\\n\"I would never stay beneath this roof to face his anger,\" said Vivian,\\nher eyes glistening. \"I would gather up what money and jewels I could\\nlay my hands on, and run away--go as far away as possible.\"\\n\\n\"Would you?\" cried Ida, in a hushed, awful voice.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" advised Vivian, firmly. \"And every moment of delay brings you\\nnearer and nearer to face the terrible ordeal that I am sure he intends\\nto mete out to you!\"\\n\\nIda rose suddenly to her feet\\n\\n\"I will do as you advise, Vivian,\" she whispered, her dark eyes filled\\nwith terror. \"I will fly at once!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLII.\\n\\n\\nVivian Deane looked down at the cowering girl at her feet. It seemed to\\nher then that her triumph was complete. She could scarcely keep back\\nthe cry of exultation that rose to her lips.\\n\\n\"How shall I leave the house without being seen?\" whispered Ida,\\npiteously.\\n\\n\"Leave that to me,\" murmured Vivian. \"I am very sorry for you, Ida, and\\nI will do all I can to aid you in this, your hour of greatest sorrow.\"\\n\\n\"You are, indeed, a true friend to me,\" sobbed Ida. \"I shall never,\\nnever forget your kindness.\"\\n\\nVivian looked a trifle uncomfortable at these words of unmerited\\npraise. She dared not remain longer with Ida, for she knew that two or\\nthree partners would be looking for her.\\n\\n\"Stay here for at least fifteen minutes,\" she said, eagerly, \"and by\\nthat time I will join you, and tell you what plans I have made for you.\"\\n\\nIda could not think for herself, her brain was so benumbed. She could\\nonly nod in silence.\\n\\nScarcely five minutes had elapsed since Vivian had quitted the\\n_boudoir_, until Eugene Mallard again knocked for admittance at the\\ndoor.\\n\\nThere was no answer. He turned the knob, entered, and found his young\\nwife lying senseless upon the carpet. For the second time, Ida had\\ngiven away to the awful agony that consumed her. Among those at the\\n_fete_ was a young doctor. Eugene summoned him hastily.\\n\\n\"Dear me, this is quite serious!\" exclaimed the doctor, as he bent over\\nthe prostrate form which Eugene had borne to a couch. \"Your wife has\\nbrain fever. It is a serious case, I fear.\"\\n\\nThe garden-party broke up quite suddenly. The news that Mrs. Mallard\\nhad been taken ill was rumored among the revelers, and silently but\\nquickly the guests took their departure, all save Vivian Deane.\\n\\nShe went up to Eugene, and laid a hand on his arm.\\n\\n\"Let me remain and nurse my dear friend Ida,\" she pleaded. \"Do not\\nrefuse, I beg of you!\"\\n\\n\"Let it be as the doctor says,\" answered Eugene.\\n\\nBut the physician shook his head decisively.\\n\\n\"This is a case requiring the most competent nurses. I am sorry to\\nrefuse you, Miss Deane, but in this instance I must do so.\"\\n\\nVivian controlled the anger that leaped into her heart.\\n\\n\"You certainly mean well,\" added the doctor, \"but in such a case as\\nthis even her nearest relatives are not to be allowed in the sick-room.\"\\n\\nVivian was obliged to swallow her chagrin as best she could. If she\\nhad been allowed her way, the young wife who had come between her love\\nand herself would never rise from her bed.\\n\\n\"When she is convalescing I will visit her,\" she said to herself.\\n\\nAs she had no excuse to remain longer in the house, she was obliged to\\ntake her departure along with the other guests.\\n\\nWhen Eugene Mallard had hurried to his room, after bidding Ida to\\nremain there until his return, it was his intention to go to his room\\nfor writing materials, and returning to Ida, force from her a written\\nconfession of her love for his friend, and her intention to elope with\\nhim.\\n\\nUnder the circumstances, he could not very well carry his plan into\\nexecution. His rage against his hapless young wife turned to pity when\\nhe saw her lying there so helplessly before him.\\n\\nDuring the fortnight that followed, the servants, who knew of their\\nmaster\\'s estrangement from his young wife, and how little he cared\\nfor her, were greatly surprised to find themselves banished from the\\nsick-room, while Eugene Mallard took possession of it.\\n\\nThe fact was, he was puzzled at her raving. Sometimes, when taking\\nthe place of the trained nurse for an hour, he was troubled beyond\\nexpression to hear her go over again and again the scene that had taken\\nplace by the brook.\\n\\nIn her delirium, Ida vehemently repulsed Arthur Hollis, demanding of\\nhim how it was that he dared speak a word of love to her, the wife of\\nanother.\\n\\nThen the scene would change, and she would fancy herself once more in\\nher own room, falling on her knees and crying out to Heaven that she\\ncould not bear her husband\\'s coldness.\\n\\nOften would Eugene listen intently while Ida clasped her hands and\\nmoaned:\\n\\n\"Oh, Eugene! Eugene! will I ever be more to you than I am now? I love\\nyou! Yes, I love you, but you will never know it! If you only knew it,\\nyou would be surprised. A wife never loved a husband more dearly, more\\ndevotedly than I love you. I would have devoted my whole life to you.\\nI would have died for you! Every beat of my heart, every thought of my\\nmind, every action of my life is for you! I love you as no one else\\never will, as no one has loved you! You may live many years, happy,\\nflattered by the women of the world, but no love like mine will ever\\ncome to you. The wife who is to you as the dirt beneath your feet is\\nthe truest friend you have!\"\\n\\nEugene Mallard looked terribly distressed as he listened.\\n\\n\"Ida, my dear wife, listen to me,\" he would say. \"I--I--shall try very\\nhard to be kinder to you than I have been. Do you hear me, do you\\nunderstand?\"\\n\\nThere was no gleam of love in the pale face; no light such as he had\\nthought his words would bring there; no gleam of joy. She did not seem\\nto understand him. He said to himself that he must be cautious; that he\\nmust not distress her by speaking words that would give her hope.\\n\\nThe news of the illness of Eugene Mallard\\'s young wife had traversed\\nfar beyond the small Virginia town. He was well known in New York, and\\nthe papers of the metropolis copied the bit of news; but in doing so,\\nthey made a great mistake. The items read that the young wife of Eugene\\nMallard had died from the effects of brain fever.\\n\\nMiss Fernly read the article, and without delay she wrote to Eugene\\nMallard.\\n\\nIn one part of her letter she said:\\n\\n \"I should never have written you the following if the wife whom you\\n had wedded through _my_ mistake had lived. But now that she is gone,\\n I will tell you the truth--that hapless deed came very near costing\\n your poor Hildegarde her life. From the time of your marriage to the\\n present, she has never been the same. She loved you then, she still\\n loves you.\\n\\n \"This is what I would advise you to do: wait a reasonable length of\\n time, and then come and claim Hildegarde, and this time nothing shall\\n happen to prevent the marriage of you two whom Heaven had intended for\\n each other. I know Hildegarde is breaking her heart day by day, hour\\n by hour, for love of you.\\n\\n \"I urge you to come to her just as soon as you think it prudent, as I\\n think it is my duty to warn you that Hildegarde is fading away before\\n our very eyes, and your presence is the only thing that can save her\\n life.\\n\\n \"I here inclose you a small portrait of her I had taken only a little\\n while ago. Her face is as sweet as a flower, but, ah, me! one can not\\n help but read the sadness in every line of it.\"\\n\\nIt was just at the time when Eugene Mallard was feeling kinder toward\\nhis wife than ever that he received Miss Fernly\\'s letter inclosing\\nHildegarde\\'s picture. He had done his best to try to crush out his\\nhopeless love for one from whom Heaven had so strangely parted him.\\n\\nGreat drops of perspiration stood out on his brow as he folded the\\nletter and turned the picture face downward on his desk.\\n\\nIt seemed to Eugene that the bitter waves of death were sweeping over\\nhim. It was the reopening of the old wound in his heart that he prayed\\nHeaven to heal. He loved Hildegarde with all the strength of his\\nmanhood. He wished that he were dead. The pain seemed greater than he\\ncould bear. He found that he still loved sweet Hildegarde; but he was\\nbound to another in honor and conscience. He would try to do his duty\\ntoward the one who bore his name.\\n\\nHe took the letter to the open fire-place, where a log fire burned\\nlazily, and knelt down before it, holding it to the flame. Red tongues\\nof fire caught at it gleefully, and the next instant it was a heap of\\nashes in one corner of the grate.\\n\\nThen he held out the picture to the flames, but involuntarily he drew\\nit back. He could not allow it to burn. It seemed to him that his own\\nheart would burn first.\\n\\n\"Heaven give me strength to destroy it!\" he cried. \"I dare not trust\\nmyself to keep it. It will drive me mad!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLIII.\\n\\n\\nThe flames touched the portrait, and with a cry Eugene Mallard hastily\\ndrew it back.\\n\\n\"No, no--a thousand times no!\" It would be as easy to burn the living,\\nbeating heart in his bosom.\\n\\nWhile he had the strength, he hurried to his writing-desk, placed it in\\na pigeon-hole, shut down the lid, and turned the key. Then he buried\\nhis face in his hands.\\n\\nHe ruminated upon the strangeness of the position he was placed in.\\nBoth of these young girls loved him, while he loved but one of them,\\nand the one whom he loved so deeply could never be anything in this\\nworld to him. He wondered in what way he had offended Heaven that such\\na fate should be meted out to him.\\n\\nAt that moment quite a thrilling scene was transpiring at the railway\\nstation of the little Virginia town.\\n\\nThe New York Express, which had just steamed in, stood before it, and\\nfrom one of the drawing-room cars there stepped a handsome man dressed\\nin the height of fashion.\\n\\nHe sauntered into the waiting-room, looking about him as though in\\nsearch of the ticket-agent.\\n\\nA woman entered the depot at that moment carrying a little child in her\\narms. She recognized the man at a single glance.\\n\\n\"Why, Mr. Royal Ainsley!\" she cried, \"is this indeed you returning to\\nyour old home?\"\\n\\nTurning hastily around at the mention of his name, he beheld Mrs.\\nLester standing before him.\\n\\n\"Yes; I have returned like a bad penny, Mrs. Lester,\" he said, with a\\nlight, flippant laugh. \"But, judging from the expression on your face,\\nyou are not glad to see me.\"\\n\\n\"I have not said so,\" she answered.\\n\\n\"Sit down, Mrs. Lester,\" he said, flinging himself down on one of the\\nbenches. \"I should like to inquire of you about the women-folk of the\\nvillage.\"\\n\\nThe woman sat down beside him, in obedience to his request.\\n\\n\"There is very little to tell,\" she answered; \"everything in our\\nvillage moves on about the same, year in and year out. Nothing of\\nimportance has taken place, except the marriage of your cousin, Eugene\\nMallard.\"\\n\\n\"Ha! ha! ha! So my fastidious cousin has changed his name from Royal\\nAinsley to that of Eugene Mallard to please his uncle, has he? Well,\\nI read of it in one of the New York papers, but I scarcely credited\\nit. Between you and me, Mrs. Lester, that was a mighty mean piece of\\nwork--the old fool leaving his entire fortune to him, and cutting me\\noff without a cent.\"\\n\\n\"Every one knows that you were warned of what was to come unless you\\nmended your ways,\" answered the woman.\\n\\n\"Bah! I never thought for a moment that the old fool would keep his\\nword,\" retorted the other. \"But you say that my cousin is wedded. That\\nis indeed news to me. Whom did he wed--Vivian Deane?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no,\" she answered, \"not Miss Deane. Every one in the village\\nprophesied that he wouldn\\'t wed her, although she was so infatuated\\nwith him.\"\\n\\n\"I suppose she is an heiress,\" said Ainsley, savagely knocking the\\nashes off his cigar. \"It\\'s easy enough to marry another fortune if you\\nhave one already.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know if she is an heiress,\" returned Mrs. Lester; \"but she\\'s\\na real lady. Any one can see that. But I fear that he is in great\\ndanger of losing her. She is now very low with brain fever, and it is\\ndoubtful whether she will live.\"\\n\\n\"Humph!\" he muttered. \"My visit here is most inopportune then. I\\nwanted to see my cousin, and strike him for the loan of a few thousand\\ndollars. He won\\'t be in very good humor now to accede to my request. I\\nthink I\\'ll keep shady and wait a fortnight before seeing him. But who\\nis _this_?\" he cried, looking at the child she carried in her arms. \"I\\nunderstood that your baby died.\"\\n\\n\"So it did,\" replied Mrs. Lester. \"This is the little foundling whom\\nwe are about to adopt. My husband brought it to me from a foundling\\nasylum.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I do declare!\" said Ainsley. \"That\\'s quite a risky operation,\\ntaking a little waif into your home, when you don\\'t know its parents.\"\\n\\n\"But I _do_ know its mother,\" she answered. \"I wrote and found out\\nall about its mother. She was a young girl who was taken ill in the\\nstreets. A poor family permitted her to be brought into their house,\\nand there her babe was born. The young mother was so ill that the babe\\nwas taken to the foundling asylum by the doctor who attended her, where\\nit could have constant attention, for its little life was despaired\\nof. By a strange mistake, word was sent to the mother that the little\\none had died. But the baby rallied and recovered. Almost heart-broken\\nover the news of its death, the young mother disappeared. There was\\nno one so interested as to make search for her, and tell her that her\\nlittle one had been spared. In her flight she left behind her a package\\nwhich contained some articles that may lead to her identity, if the\\nchild should ever want to find her hapless mother when she grows to\\nwomanhood. I have them with me now. Do let me show them to you, Mr.\\nAinsley.\"\\n\\nAt that moment the little one, who had been sleeping, slowly opened its\\ngreat, dark, solemn eyes, looked up into the face of Royal Ainsley, and\\nuttered a plaintive little sob.\\n\\nIt was not often that he noticed little children--indeed, he had an\\naversion to them--but he could not understand the impulse that made\\nhim bend forward and look with interest into the flower-like little\\nface.\\n\\nWhere had he seen just such a face? The great, dark, solemn eyes, so\\nlike purple <DW29>s, held him spell-bound.\\n\\nAn impulse which he could not control or define caused him to reach out\\nhis trembling hand and touch the waxen little fingers, and the contact\\nmade the blood rush through his veins like fire. He tried to speak, but\\nhis tongue seemed too thick and heavy to perform its functions.\\n\\nThe woman did not notice his agitation. She was busily engaged in\\nunwrapping a small parcel which she had tied up in oil silk.\\n\\nThen, to his astonished gaze, Mrs. Lester held up before him a\\nbeautiful bracelet made of tiny pink sea-shells, with a heavy gold\\nclasp, upon which was engraved, \"From R. to I.\"\\n\\nIf Mrs. Lester had but looked at him, she would have seen that his face\\nhad grown ghastly.\\n\\nAt a glance he recognized the bracelet as one which he had designed\\nand presented to Ida May, at Newport, when he believed her to be the\\nheiress of the wealthy Mays.\\n\\n\"That is not all,\" said Mrs. Lester, holding up a man\\'s pocket-book,\\nwhich he recognized as his own---the identical one he had sent up to\\nIda May by the porter, with a little change in it, on the morning he\\ndeserted her.\\n\\nAgain he opened his mouth to speak; but no sound issued from his\\nlips. The pocket-book contained only a part of a sleeve-link that had\\nbelonged to himself, the other part of the link was in his pocket at\\nthat moment.\\n\\nIn a flash, the truth came to him--this little one was Ida May\\'s child.\\n\\nHe now recalled the appealing letters she had written to him at the\\nhotel after he had deserted her. He had never answered them, for by\\nthat time he was trying to win the beautiful heiress, Florence St.\\nJohn. He had told Ida May that his marriage to her was not legal, while\\nin truth it was as binding as Church and State could make it.\\n\\nHe had cast all upon the throw of a dice, and it would never do for the\\npoor young girl whom he had married to come between him and the young\\ngirl whom he was about to win.\\n\\nHe had resolved upon a desperate scheme to gain a fortune, by deluding\\nthe young girl whom he had made his wife into believing that she was\\nnot such, and going through the ceremony with the heiress, Florence St.\\nJohn.\\n\\nBut Fate had snatched the beautiful Florence St. John from his grasp\\njust as he was about to wed her. Her brother came on the scene, and\\nRoyal Ainsley beat a hasty retreat, as he had commenced to inquire into\\nhis antecedents.\\n\\nAll these thoughts flashed through his brain in an instant. Then he\\nrealized that Mrs. Lester was speaking to him.\\n\\n\"A pretty baby, is she not?\" said the woman, holding the infant toward\\nhim. \"But we have decided not to keep her, after all. I am going to\\ntake the first train to New York, and return the baby to the foundling\\nasylum, though Heaven knows I shall miss her sorely. We are too poor to\\nkeep her.\"\\n\\nRoyal Ainsley turned toward her with strange eagerness.\\n\\n\"What do you say if I take your charge off your hands?\" he asked,\\nhuskily.\\n\\n\"You, Mr. Ainsley?\" exclaimed the woman, amazed. \"Why, what in the\\nworld could _you_, a young bachelor, do with a baby?\"\\n\\n\"I will give you one hundred dollars to give me the child. Is it a\\nbargain, Mrs. Lester? Speak quickly, before I change my mind!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLIV.\\n\\n\\nRoyal Ainsley leaned forward, and caught Mrs. Lester\\'s arm, saying\\nhastily:\\n\\n\"I repeat, that you shall have one hundred dollars if you will but give\\nthe child into my custody.\"\\n\\n\"Again I ask, what could you, a bachelor, do with it, Mr. Ainsley?\"\\nsaid Mrs. Lester.\\n\\nHe had an answer ready for her.\\n\\n\"I know a family who lost a little one, and would be only too delighted\\nto take the infant and give it a good home.\"\\n\\nMrs. Lester breathed a sigh of relief.\\n\\n\"I am very poor, as you know very well, Mr. Ainsley,\" she answered,\\n\"and I can not refuse your kind offer. Take the little one with\\nwelcome. Only be sure that it is a good home you consign it to.\"\\n\\nHe counted out the money and handed it to her, and she resigned the\\ninfant to his arms. At that moment they heard the shriek of the\\nincoming express.\\n\\n\"That is the train I was going to take,\" she said, \"and now I am out\\nthe price of my ticket, which I bought in advance.\"\\n\\n\"If you will give it to me, I will use it,\" he said.\\n\\nShe handed him the ticket, and in another moment Mrs. Lester saw him\\nboard the train with the child.\\n\\n\"I wonder if I have done right or wrong,\" she thought, a scared look\\ncoming into her face. \"It was all done so quickly that I had not the\\ntime to consider the matter. But this much I do know; I have the\\nhundred dollars in my pocket, and that is a God-send to me. We need the\\nmoney badly just now.\"\\n\\nShe turned and walked slowly away; but somehow she did not seem quite\\neasy regarding the fate of the little child.\\n\\n\"I ought to have asked him the name of the family to whom he was going\\nto take the baby,\" she mused; \"then I could have written to them to be\\nvery careful, and to bring her up to be a good and true woman. I shall\\ncertainly ask him all about it the very next time I see him--that is,\\nif I ever _do_ see him.\"\\n\\nMeanwhile the train thundered on, carrying Royal Ainsley and the child\\naway. It was hard to keep back the expression of mingled hatred and\\nrage with which Royal Ainsley regarded the infant he held in his arms.\\nHe knew full well that the child was his own, but he had no love for\\nit. If it had died then and there, that fact would have afforded him\\nmuch satisfaction.\\n\\nBut one course presented itself. He would take it to New York, and once\\nthere, he would have no further trouble with it--he would manage to\\nlose it. Many waifs were found on the doorsteps, and no one ever could\\ntrace their parentage, or whose hand had placed them there.\\n\\nIn all probability he would never run across Ida May again. She\\nbelieved her child dead.\\n\\nWhile these thoughts were flitting through his brain, the little one\\ncommenced to cry. Its piteous wails attracted the attention of more\\nthan one person in the car.\\n\\n\"Mother,\" said a buxom young woman sitting opposite, \"I am sure that\\nyoung man is a widower, left with the little child, and he is taking it\\nto his folks. You see he is in deep mourning.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll bet that baby\\'s hungry, mother, and I\\'ll bet, too, that he hasn\\'t\\na nursing-bottle to feed it from.\"\\n\\n\"You can depend upon it that he has one,\" remarked her mother. \"Every\\nfather knows that much about babies.\"\\n\\n\"Of course he has it in his pocket; he never came away without one; but\\nhe is so deeply engrossed in his own thoughts that he does not hear the\\nbaby. Don\\'t you think you ought to give him a little reminder of it?\"\\nsaid her daughter, thoughtfully. \"You\\'re an elderly woman, and can do\\nit.\"\\n\\n\"He might tell me to mind my own business,\" said the elder woman. \"Some\\nstrangers don\\'t take kindly to other people meddling in their affairs.\"\\n\\nAs the plaintive wails of the infant increased instead of diminished,\\nthe elder woman got up and made her way up the aisle.\\n\\nRoyal Ainsley started violently as he felt the heavy hand on his\\nshoulder.\\n\\n\"Why don\\'t you feed your baby, sir?\" she said, brusquely.\\n\\nHe looked at her angrily, his brows bent together in a decided frown.\\n\\n\"What do you mean by interrupting my thoughts, woman?\" he cried,\\nharshly.\\n\\nHis angry retort roused all the antagonism in the woman\\'s nature.\\n\\n\"I mean just what I say--your baby\\'s hungry, mister,\" she replied. \"If\\nyou had the feelings of a loving father, you\\'d know enough to feed it.\"\\n\\nHe looked at her in consternation.\\n\\n\"Feed it?\" he echoed, blankly. \"I--I was not prepared for anything like\\nthis. Such a thing did not occur to me.\"\\n\\n\"And you didn\\'t bring a nursing-bottle along with you?\" echoed the\\nwoman.\\n\\n\"No,\" he responded, curtly, but also somewhat blankly.\\n\\n\"Good Lord! that\\'s just like a man, to forget important things like\\nthat.\"\\n\\n\"What am I to do?\" he asked, appealingly. \"What would you suggest,\\nmadame. I am at sea.\"\\n\\nShe looked at him perplexedly; then her motherly face brightened as she\\nglanced about the car.\\n\\n\"I will soon see what can be done,\" she answered, making her way as\\nquickly as the moving train would allow to the end of the car, where\\ntwo women sat with tiny infants on their laps.\\n\\nVery soon she returned with the article she had gone in search of.\\n\\n\"Let me take the poor little thing,\" she said, \"and feed it. Men, and\\nmore especially young men, don\\'t know anything about such things.\"\\n\\nRoyal Ainsley gladly delivered his charge into her keeping. Very soon\\nthe woman had stilled its cries, and it was sleeping peacefully in her\\narms. An idea then came to Royal Ainsley. His pale-blue eyes glittered\\nwith a fiendish light.\\n\\nHe almost laughed aloud at the thought that flashed through his mind.\\n\\n\"Do you think the baby will sleep a little while?\" he asked, drawing\\nhis hat down over his face.\\n\\n\"It is likely to,\" she answered; \"still, one can not always tell.\\nSamantha, my daughter here, never slept ten minutes on a stretch when\\nshe was a baby. She was a lot of trouble to me then; but I don\\'t mind\\nit now, for she\\'s a heap of comfort to me, sir. I wouldn\\'t know how to\\nget along without Samantha. She----\"\\n\\nRoyal Ainsley interrupted her impatiently.\\n\\n\"I was going to say that if you would be kind enough to hold the little\\none for awhile I would like to go into the smoking-car and smoke a\\ncigar.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLV.\\n\\n\\nRoyal Ainsley thought the woman did not hear his question, for she did\\nnot answer, and he repeated, in his suave, winning way:\\n\\n\"Could I trouble you to hold the little one a few moments, while I\\nenjoy a smoke in the car ahead?\"\\n\\nWidow Jones answered readily enough:\\n\\n\"To be sure I will take care of the little one, sir. Go right along and\\nenjoy your cigar. I know just how a man feels when he is deprived of a\\nsmoke. My husband had to have his pipe every night after his supper,\\njust as sure as the sun went down. If he missed it, he was fairly\\nbeside himself--like a fish out of water.\"\\n\\nIt suddenly occurred to Royal Ainsley that it wouldn\\'t be a bad idea to\\nknow more about this woman.\\n\\n\"Do you live near here?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"Just three stations above--near Larchmont village. We won\\'t reach\\nthere for nearly three-quarters of an hour, so that need not trouble\\nyou, sir. I take it that you are a widower, sir,\" she went on, before\\nhe could rise from his seat.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he answered, shortly, and with considerable impatience.\\n\\n\"It\\'s too bad!\" chimed in Samantha--\"and to be left with such a young\\nbaby, too. It\\'s too bad that you didn\\'t get a nurse for her, unless you\\nare taking her to some of your folks.\"\\n\\n\"I have no relatives,\" he answered. \"I am going to New York for the\\nexpress purpose of finding some one to take care of the child.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed!\" exclaimed Widow Jones. \"How strange that you should\\ncome across me! Why, do you know, I used to take little ones in\\noccasionally, and keep them for their fathers until they were old\\nenough to get about. Before you look further, sir--although I don\\'t\\nlike to recommend myself--I\\'d like to have you stop off at Larchmont\\nand inquire all about me. There isn\\'t a man, woman, or child for miles\\naround but can tell you about me.\"\\n\\n\"Why, it is indeed a piece of good luck that I should have come across\\nyou, madame!\" declared Royal Ainsley. \"We may be able to come to terms\\nhere and now.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t ask too much, ma,\" whispered Samantha, under her breath.\\n\\n\"You can set your own price,\" said Royal Ainsley, in an off-hand manner.\\n\\n\"Oh, I will leave that entirely to you, sir,\" said the widow. \"I\\'ll\\ntake the baby and care for her, and you can come and see her whenever\\nyou like. I\\'ll leave the pay entirely to you. That\\'s fair enough, sir,\\nisn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\"You are entirely too magnanimous,\" he declared. \"By the way, here\\'s a\\nten-dollar note to start with. That\\'s the only bill I have, save those\\nof very large denomination. In the course of a few weeks I will make\\npermanent arrangements with you.\"\\n\\n\"But surely you are going to stop off at Larchmont, sir, and see where\\nI live. I don\\'t expect that you will trust a dear little baby like this\\nto a stranger. You will most likely want a recommendation.\"\\n\\n\"Your face is certainly recommendation enough, my good woman,\" he\\ndeclared. \"Nevertheless, I shall, of course, stop off with you.\"\\n\\nHe rose with a bow.\\n\\n\"Remember, sir,\" chimed in Samantha, \"that part of the train switches\\noff just a few miles below there. If you don\\'t look out, you\\'ll be\\ntaken on to New York.\"\\n\\n\"I must look out for that,\" he said. \"I had certainly intended to take\\na little nap after my smoke. I haven\\'t closed my eyes for two nights;\\nthe baby was not feeling well. Your warning will put me on my guard, at\\nall events.\"\\n\\nAgain he bowed, and in an instant he had disappeared.\\n\\n\"I wonder what his name is,\" said Samantha. \"You forgot to ask him, ma.\"\\n\\n\"So I did, to be sure. But it\\'s easy finding that out.\"\\n\\nFurther conversation was stopped by the sudden waking up of the pretty\\ndark-eyed babe; but a little milk from the bottle and a few soothing\\nwords soon succeeded in quieting her.\\n\\n\"We are almost at the switch,\" said Samantha. \"Ought not somebody go\\ninto the smoking-car and inform the gentleman of it?\"\\n\\n\"Why, certainly not. It\\'s likely he knows of it. He was told of it,\\nand it\\'s likely some one will inform him. You had better look after\\nyour boxes and bundles. Be sure to pick up the bag of candy, the\\nginger-snaps, the bunch of bachelor buttons, the rosemary, my shawl,\\nand your new pair of shoes.\"\\n\\n\"If I have to hold this baby and pick up my dress, it will be as much\\nas I can do. But I\\'m quite sure the gentleman will come and take care\\nof the baby himself,\" added Samantha, wistfully.\\n\\nThe conductor called out the station. It was the busiest junction in\\nthe northern part of Virginia. Two trains met and passed each other\\nhere, while still another was side-tracked, waiting for the right of\\nway. There was always a rush of people at the station, and consequently\\nconfusion and noise. Widow Jones and Samantha stepped from the car to\\nthe platform.\\n\\n\"We ought to have waited,\" declared the girl. \"See, we have missed him,\\nas I told you we would. I had better run back and see if he\\'s there.\\nHe\\'s probably going on to New York. But he will be sure to see us, no\\nmatter what car he is in.\"\\n\\nA moment more, and the two trains moved on. Even Widow Jones was now\\nthoroughly alarmed. What her daughter had feared had taken place. The\\nyoung man had certainly missed them.\\n\\n\"Overcome with fatigue, he probably fell asleep in the smoking-car, in\\nspite of himself,\" said Samantha.\\n\\n\"Well, anyhow he knows your name and address, mother. He will be sure\\nto telegraph back to us at Larchmont.\"\\n\\nStill, Widow Jones, who held the baby close in her arms, looked\\ntroubled.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLVI.\\n\\n\\n\"He has certainly been carried on to New York,\" said Widow Jones.\\n\"There is nothing left but to get home and await results.\"\\n\\n\"I guess you\\'re about right,\" said Samantha.\\n\\nThey left word at the railroad station to at once bring up any telegram\\nthat might come for them.\\n\\nAn hour after they arrived at Larchmont, every one had heard of Mrs.\\nJones and the baby, and her experience with the handsome stranger.\\n\\nWhen a fortnight passed, and the weeks lengthened into months, Mrs.\\nJones began to be a little skeptical.\\n\\n\"We will keep the baby until he _does_ come for it, Samantha,\" she said.\\n\\nSomehow the little waif with the great dark eyes and the little\\nrose-bud mouth had crept into their hearts, and they could not turn it\\naway.\\n\\nSamantha did her share in looking after the baby; but it was a little\\nhard, for she had a great deal to do waiting upon customers in the\\nvillage bakery.\\n\\nThe mother and daughter made no further mention of the handsome\\nstranger.\\n\\n\"If we had but asked him his name. I wanted you to, ma,\" declared\\nSamantha. \"But there\\'s no use in crying now. We have the satisfaction\\nof having a baby, anyhow,\" declared the girl, spiritedly.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" assented her mother, dubiously; \"but it\\'s quite a task to bring\\nup other people\\'s children.\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, freed from the care of the child, Royal Ainsley walked\\nthrough the train. It was just approaching the station, when, all\\nunobserved, he swung from the back platform just as the express was\\nmoving out again.\\n\\nA chuckle of delight broke from his lips.\\n\\n\"That was most cleverly managed. My compliments to Mrs. Jones, of\\nLarchmont. She has been exceedingly useful to me.\"\\n\\nHe did not trouble himself as to what disposition they might make of\\nthe child.\\n\\nThe question that occurred to him was--\"how am I to destroy the proofs\\nI have concerning the child?\"\\n\\nBut no answer came to him regarding this dilemma. He thrust them back\\ninto his pocket. He would have plenty of time to plan when he reached\\nNew York.\\n\\nSuddenly the thought came to him, that he would be foolish to turn back\\nfrom the course he had marked out for himself. Instead of returning, he\\nwould go back and see Eugene.\\n\\nThere was a friend of his living in the vicinity. He would find him,\\nand pass a week or two with him, then he would carry out his original\\nscheme. He acted upon this thought.\\n\\nIt was the fishing season, and Royal Ainsley made a valuable addition\\nto a party of young men already gathered at his friend\\'s quarters. Five\\nweeks elapsed before the party broke up.\\n\\n\"By this time Eugene\\'s wife must have recovered from her illness,\" he\\nsaid, grimly. \"If I don\\'t go and see him now, they will probably be\\ngetting ready to go off somewhere, and I will miss them.\"\\n\\nSuiting the action to the word, Royal Ainsley took the train the next\\nday and arrived at his native village at dusk.\\n\\nHe had taken the precaution to provide himself with a long top-coat and\\na slouch hat.\\n\\nHe avoided the depot and its waiting-room, lest he should meet some one\\nwho might recognize him.\\n\\nHe struck into a side-path, and a sharp walk of some fifteen minutes\\nbrought him in sight of the old mansion.\\n\\nHow dark and gloomy the night was! There was no moon, and not a star\\nshone in the heavens.\\n\\nA short cut across the fields brought him to a little brook. He looked\\ndown upon it in silence as it gurgled on sullenly over its rocky bed.\\n\\nHe looked back at the grand old mansion looming up in the distance. And\\nas he looked, he clinched his hands, and the bitterness in his heart\\nbecame more intense.\\n\\n\"But for Eugene, all that would be mine,\" he muttered. \"He stepped\\nbetween me and the fortune. When we were boys together, I realized that\\nhe would do it, and I hated him--hated him for his suave, winning ways\\nand the love which every one showered on him. He was always lucky.\"\\n\\nHe turned and looked again at the great stone mansion, whose turrets\\nwere dimly outlined against the sky. And as he looked he saw a door on\\nthe rear porch open and a figure clad in a white, fleecy dress glide\\nout upon the porch and walk slowly into the grounds.\\n\\n\"That is probably the bride,\" he muttered, with a harsh little laugh.\\n\\nTo his surprise, she crossed the lawn and made directly for the spot\\nwhere he stood.\\n\\n\"I shall not be likely to get a good look at her unless the moon comes\\nout,\" he thought.\\n\\nHe drew back into the shadow of the alders that skirted the brook. His\\nbitter, vengeful thoughts were turned aside for a moment while watching\\nthe advancing figure.\\n\\n\"Why should my cousin have wealth, love, happiness, while I have to\\nknock about here and there, getting my living as best I can, being\\nalways in hard luck and a mark for the arrows of relentless fate?\" he\\nsoliloquized.\\n\\nNearer and nearer drew the slender, graceful figure.\\n\\nRoyal Ainsley was right. It was his cousin\\'s wife.\\n\\nShe went on slowly over the greensward in the sweet night air, little\\ndreaming what lay at the end of her path.\\n\\nBy the merest chance the hapless young wife had come across the letter\\nthat Miss Fernly had written to Eugene Mallard. It had fallen from his\\npocket when he was looking over some papers on the porch one day.\\n\\nPassing by soon after, Ida saw the paper lying there, picked it up, and\\nopened it. There, while the sun shone and the birds sung, she read it\\nthrough, and the wonder was that she did not die then and there.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLVII.\\n\\n\\nFrom the moment that Ida had learned through Miss Fernly\\'s letter how\\nHildegarde Cramer had mourned for her lover, the young wife\\'s life had\\nbecome very unhappy.\\n\\nShe knew well that she stood between Hildegarde Cramer and her\\nhappiness. She had done her best to die, but Heaven had not so willed\\nit.\\n\\nThe pity of it was that her love for Eugene Mallard had increased a\\nhundred fold. It was driving her to madness.\\n\\n\"Oh, if it were all ended!\" she cried aloud. \"Better anything than this\\nawful despair!\"\\n\\nNo one heard her. There was no one near to hear what she moaned out to\\nthe brook that kept so many secrets.\\n\\nShe heard a crash in the branches near by--a slight crash, but she\\nstarted. It was only a bird that had fallen from its nest in the tree\\noverhead, she told herself.\\n\\nBut even after she had said it she felt a sense of uncontrollable\\nterror that she could not account for; felt the weight of some strange\\npresence.\\n\\nThat voice!\\n\\nWhen Ida cried aloud in her despair, the words fell like an electric\\nshock upon the ears of a man who listened behind the alder branches.\\n\\n\"By all that is wonderful!\" he cried, under his breath. \"Either my ears\\nhave deceived me, or that is the voice of Ida May! Well, well! Will\\nsurprises never cease?\"\\n\\nHe stepped quickly forward, and the next moment he was by her side. How\\nstrange it was that at that instant the moon came out from behind a\\ncloud and rendered every object as bright as if in the noonday sun.\\n\\nAt the sound of the step, Ida started back in affright.\\n\\nOne glance into the face looking down into her own and she started back\\nwith a cry that was scarcely human.\\n\\n\"You!\" she gasped.\\n\\nThen her lips grew cold and stiff. She could not utter another word.\\n\\n\"The surprise is mutual!\" he answered. \"What in the name of all that is\\nwonderful are you doing in this house? Come, my dear, let us sit down\\non this log while you explain matters.\"\\n\\nIda drew back in loathing.\\n\\n\"Stand back!\" she cried. \"Do not attempt to touch me, or I shall cry\\nout for help!\"\\n\\nA fierce imprecation broke from the man\\'s lips.\\n\\n\"What do you mean by all this high and mighty nonsense?\" he cried.\\n\"Speak at once. You are my wife! Why shouldn\\'t I lay hands on you?\"\\n\\n\"No!\" she cried. \"Though you have so cruelly deceived me, I thank God\\nthat I am not your wife.\"\\n\\nHe threw back his fair, handsome head, and a laugh that was not\\npleasant to hear fell from his lips.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t make any mistake about that!\" he cried. \"I remember what I\\nwrote you--that there was some illegality in the ceremony which made\\nour marriage invalid. But I learned afterward, when I met the chap\\nwho performed the ceremony, that it was entirely legal. If you doubt\\nthat what I say is true, I can easily convince you of the truth of my\\nassertion.\"\\n\\nIda drew back with a cry so awful that he looked at her.\\n\\n\"Well, well, who can understand the ways of women?\" he remarked,\\nironically. \"I thought that you would rejoice over the fact that our\\nmarriage was legal, but I find that you are sorry.\"\\n\\nStill she was looking at him with wide-open eyes.\\n\\n\"I can not, I will not believe anything so horrible!\" she gasped. \"It\\nwould drive me mad!\"\\n\\n\"I assure you it is true,\" he declared. \"Like yourself, I believed that\\nthe marriage was not binding. But I found it was, and that saved me\\nfrom wedding another girl.\"\\n\\nA cry that seemed to rend her heart in twain broke from her white lips.\\n\\n\"But tell me, what are you doing here?\" he asked, wonderingly.\\n\\nThen it was that something like an inkling of the truth came to him.\\n\\n\"Great God!\" he cried, \"it can not be possible that you are in any\\nway connected with my cousin--that you are the bride he brought home?\\nSpeak! Why are you trembling so? Has my guess come anywhere near the\\nmark?\"\\n\\nIda looked up at him with wild, frightened eyes like those of a hunted\\ndeer.\\n\\n\"Speak!\" he cried again, fiercely grasping her arm, \"or I will wring\\nthe truth from you!\"\\n\\n\"I--I am Eugene Mallard\\'s wife,\" she whispered in a voice that would\\nhave touched any other man\\'s heart than the one who was bending over\\nher with rage depicted on his face.\\n\\nHe laughed aloud, and that laugh was horrible to hear.\\n\\nShe did not spare herself. She told him all the bitter truth--how,\\nbeing thrown in contact with Eugene Mallard day after day, she had\\nlearned to love him with all the strength of her nature; how, seeing\\nhow good, kind and true he was--a king among men--she fell face\\ndownward in the dew-wet grass and cried out to Heaven that her life\\nwould cease the moment she went out of Eugene Mallard\\'s life.\\n\\n\"This is, indeed, a fine state of affairs!\" he cried out.\\n\\n\"What would you have me do?\" cried the unhappy young girl in the voice\\nof one dying.\\n\\nHe did not answer her at once; but, taking a cigar from his pocket, he\\ncoolly lighted it.\\n\\n\"When you are through with your hysterics, we will talk the matter\\nover,\" he assented, frowningly.\\n\\nShe struggled to her feet.\\n\\n\"Sit down!\" he commanded, pointing to the trunk of a tree.\\n\\nFeeling more dead than alive, she sat down in the place which he had\\nindicated. She expected that her life would end at any moment, the\\ntension on her nerves was so great.\\n\\nHe did not speak; but the short, harsh laugh that broke from his lips,\\nas he puffed away at his cigar, was more cruel than the harshest words.\\n\\n\"This is what one might call a melodrama in real life,\" he said, at\\nlength. \"It savors of comedy, too, and illustrates fully the old\\nsaying: \\'Truth is often stranger than fiction!\\' But, to get down to\\nbusiness. Turn around and face me, while I tell you the injunction I\\nlay upon you, and which you dare not refuse to obey!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\\n\\n\\nThe hapless young wife looked into the hard, set face above her, her\\neyes dilating with fear.\\n\\nHer brain reeled; it seemed to her that she was dying.\\n\\n\"Listen to what I have to say,\" exclaimed Royal Ainsley, his hand\\ntightening on her shoulder. \"You have a fine home here--much finer\\nthan I could possibly offer you--and I propose that you shall keep\\nit. There is no use in wasting sentiment between us. We do not care\\nfor each other, and you _do_ care for Eugene Mallard. It will be some\\nsatisfaction for you to live beneath this roof, and I won\\'t mind it\\nat all, providing you make it worth my while. I will make my meaning\\nclearer to you. I must have some money, and you are the one who must\\nhelp me to it. Get a thousand dollars, and I will go away and never\\nagain molest you. Come, now, what do you say?\"\\n\\nIda drew back and looked at him.\\n\\n\"You know that I could not get it for you,\" she said, with calmness.\\n\\n\"You know the alternative,\" he said, harshly.\\n\\n\"No matter what the alternative is, I--I could not help you,\" she\\nanswered, huskily.\\n\\n\"If you refuse,\" he went on, \"I can have Eugene Mallard and yourself\\narrested for bigamy. I can send you both to prison, and, so help me\\nHeaven, I\\'ll do it! You say that you love Eugene Mallard. We will see\\nif you love him well enough to save him.\"\\n\\n\"You monster!\" she gasped, wildly, \"you would not do such a thing, I\\nsay. You dare not outrage Heaven like that.\"\\n\\n\"The shoe is on the other foot. It is _you_ who have outraged Heaven\\nin violating the law. I must have that money, and you know I am a\\ndesperate man.\"\\n\\nHe would not tell her just now that her child was alive. He would save\\nthat piece of news for some other time.\\n\\nBefore she could reply, they saw some of the servants crossing the lawn.\\n\\n\"I must go!\" she cried, wrenching herself free from his grasp. \"They\\nhave come in search of me!\"\\n\\n\"I shall be here to-morrow night at this very spot awaiting your\\nanswer,\" he said, harshly.\\n\\nWhy had Heaven let Royal Ainsley find her? Had he not already brought\\nmisery enough into her life?\\n\\nShe turned the matter over in her mind. Every word he had said, every\\nthreat he had made, occurred to her.\\n\\nWould he make good his threat, and take vengeance upon the man she\\nloved if she refused to raise one thousand dollars for him?\\n\\nShe knew he was what he had said--a desperate man.\\n\\nOh, if she had but dared creep into the library, throw herself at\\nEugene Mallard\\'s feet, and tell him all, what woe would have been\\nspared her. But, alas! she dared not.\\n\\nHeaven help her! How could she leave Eugene Mallard, whom she loved\\nbetter than life.\\n\\nShe crept up to her room, and during the long hours of the night she\\nfought the fiercest battle that woman ever fought with herself. If she\\ngave Royal Ainsley the money he had asked for, he would certainly go\\naway and never cross her path again.\\n\\nHer heart leaped at the thought. The thought that she was still bound\\nto Royal Ainsley brought with it the most poignant grief--a feeling of\\nhorror.\\n\\nShe did realize what it meant to live there beneath that roof, even\\nafter she had found out the truth--that she was not Eugene Mallard\\'s\\nwife.\\n\\nWhat harm was there in living in the home of the man she loved, seeing\\nthat they were so far apart in heart as well as in purpose?\\n\\n\"No, I can not tear myself away from the only one I have ever loved!\"\\nshe cried. \"If I were living here with Eugene Mallard as his wife, then\\nmy duty would be plain--I would have to leave here at once.\"\\n\\nNo, no! Come what might, she could not tear herself away from Eugene\\nMallard.\\n\\nIn the drawer of her writing-desk lay a roll of bills which Eugene had\\nhanded her the day before, to purchase new furniture for her suite of\\nrooms.\\n\\n\"Select it the first day you go to the city,\" he had said.\\n\\nShe had intended purchasing it the following week.\\n\\nNow she went hurriedly to her desk, took out the roll of bills, and\\ncounted them.\\n\\nThere was just a thousand dollars. She drew a great sigh of relief.\\nThat would buy Royal Ainsley\\'s eternal silence. Before handing it to\\nhim, she would swear him to secrecy forever.\\n\\nShe never knew how she lived through the next day.\\n\\nThere was not a moment that Royal Ainsley\\'s handsome, cruel, sneering\\nface did not appear before her.\\n\\nHow she loathed him! She hated, with fierce, intense hatred, the very\\nsound of his name.\\n\\nNight came at last.\\n\\nThe few guests that were stopping at the house were assembled in the\\ndrawing-room, and it was not an easy matter to find some convenient\\nexcuse to get away from them.\\n\\nBut when the hands of the clock on the mantel pointed to the hour of\\neight, she felt that she must get away.\\n\\nSome one suggested playing a piece of music which she had taken to her\\nroom the day before to study.\\n\\n\"I will go and search for it,\" she said; and with that remark she\\nglided from the room.\\n\\nHow dark the night was! She almost shivered as she touched the graveled\\nwalk and hurried down to the brook-side.\\n\\nWhen this night had passed away, a life-time of happiness would lay\\nbefore her. The wind moaned fitfully among the trees, and the branches\\nof the tall oaks swayed to and fro. She heard the murmur of the brook\\nbefore she reached it, and as she drew near and became accustomed to\\nthe dim light, she saw a tall man pacing up and down.\\n\\nHe did not hear the light step on the grass. He was muttering\\nimprecations that made the girl\\'s heart turn cold with dread as she\\nlistened. Then he saw her.\\n\\n\"Ah! you have come!\" he eagerly called out. \"It is well for you that\\nyou did,\" he continued, \"for I had just made up my mind to go to the\\nhouse and ask for you.\"\\n\\nIn the dim light he saw her recoil. Although she made no answer, he\\nfancied he could almost hear the wild throbbing of her heart.\\n\\n\"Did you bring the money?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" she answered hoarsely; \"but before I give it to you, I shall\\nexact a solemn promise that you will never come near me again!\"\\n\\n\"Certainly you shall have the promise--a dozen of them if you like,\"\\nhe cried, forcing back an insolent laugh.\\n\\n\"You must solemnly promise that you will never come near me again if I\\ngive this money to you,\" she said.\\n\\n\"No,\" he answered; \"I will never come near you. I will go abroad. Does\\nthat satisfy you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" she answered. \"Only go so far away that I shall never see your\\nface again.\"\\n\\nHe closed his hand eagerly over the money, saying to himself that it\\nwas a veritable gold mine that he had found.\\n\\n\"Let me go!\" she panted, as he put out his hand to touch her.\\n\\nWith the swiftness of a startled deer, she fled past him into the\\ndarkness of the grounds.\\n\\nRoyal Ainsley laughed harshly.\\n\\n\"This money will last me for a few weeks, my lady,\" he muttered, \"and\\nthen--Ah! we shall see!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLIX.\\n\\n\\nWhen Ida re-entered the house, the guests were still assembled in the\\ndrawing-room.\\n\\nEugene Mallard was standing a little apart from the rest, looking\\nthoughtfully into vacancy.\\n\\nAs she entered the room, he started, and, to her surprise, he crossed\\nover to her.\\n\\n\"Ida,\" he said, \"will you come out on the porch with me for a few\\nmoments? I wish to speak with you.\"\\n\\nShe looked at him in terror. Had he learned of the return of Royal\\nAinsley?\\n\\nA great darkness seemed to suddenly envelop her, and it was by the\\ngreatest effort that she kept herself from swooning. But the fresh air\\nrevived her.\\n\\nEugene placed a chair for her, and as she was trembling violently,\\nshe was glad to sink into it. There was a seat near. Eugene did not\\ntake it, but, instead, stood leaning against one of the fluted columns\\nof the porch. For a few moments he was silent, and those few moments\\nseemed like long years to Ida.\\n\\n\"I have brought you out here to have an earnest talk with you,\" he\\nsaid, huskily. \"The time has now come when we should try to understand\\neach other. Don\\'t you think so?\"\\n\\nShe looked up at him in affright. Was he going to send her away? Was he\\ngrowing tired of the position in which they stood to each other?\\n\\n\"Yes,\" she answered; and it caused her a desperate effort to utter the\\nword.\\n\\n\"I am going to take you into my confidence, Ida,\" he said. \"Come under\\nthis swinging lamp. I want to read you this letter.\"\\n\\nShe followed him with faltering steps.\\n\\nTo her great surprise she saw him take from his breast-pocket the very\\nletter which Miss Fernly had sent, and which she had slipped into\\nhis desk. But she dared not tell him that she knew what the letter\\ncontained.\\n\\n\"I will preface my remarks by saying that the news of your illness has\\nspread far and wide, and that the report was repeated in different\\nforms. Instead of saying that you were ill, some of the papers had it\\nthat my young wife had died. Miss Fernly, whom you have good reason to\\nremember, thereupon wrote me this letter.\"\\n\\nShe listened, her face white as death. He handed her the letter. Every\\nword made a new wound in her heart. How well she remembered each and\\nevery sentence! Slowly she read the letter through. Then she folded and\\nhanded it back to him.\\n\\n\"Ida,\" he said, \"I have been trying to forget the past as no man has\\never tried before. All my time has been given up to it. I have drawn\\na curtain over my past, and shut out its brightness, its hopes, from\\nmy life. I have pulled the roots of a beautiful budding plant from my\\nsoul, and bid it grow there no more. I have tried to do my duty by you,\\nand now I have come to this conclusion--you must help me bury the past.\\nI have brought you out here to ask you to be my wife in fact as well as\\nin name.\"\\n\\nHe did not tell her that during her illness he had discovered the\\nsecret of her life--that she loved him with all the passionate love of\\nher nature, and that his indifference was eating out her life.\\n\\nEver since he had been turning the matter over in his mind, and asking\\nhimself what he should do, and at last he was brought face to face with\\nthe truth--he had no right to marry her unless he intended living with\\nher.\\n\\nSo clearly had his duty become defined to him that the path of\\nthe future was now plain before him. He must forget his love for\\nHildegarde, and the only way to do that was to ask the wife he had\\nwedded to help him.\\n\\n\"I ask you this after much calm deliberation,\" he said, slowly. \"Be\\nmy wife in reality as well as in name, and we may yet make good and\\nuseful lives out of what is left of them!\"\\n\\nHe heard a cry escape from her lips, but he could not tell whether it\\nwas one of pleasure or pain.\\n\\n\"I do not ask you to give my answer at once, unless you choose to do\\nso,\" he said, gently.\\n\\nHe bent over her and took her hand. He was startled at its icy\\ncoldness. He could feel that she trembled at his touch.\\n\\n\"I have startled you,\" he said, gently. \"I would advise you to go to\\nyour room, instead of mingling with the guests to-night. There you can\\nreflect upon what you wish to do. I will leave you here,\" he said. But\\nbefore he turned away, he involuntarily stooped down, and kissed the\\nwhite face raised so appealingly to his.\\n\\nIt was the first caress he had ever offered her, and that kiss burned\\nher face for long hours afterward. It filled her to the very depth of\\nher soul, to the very center of her heart.\\n\\nLike one stricken suddenly blind, Ida groped her way to her room.\\n\\n\"Ah! if I could only die with the memory of that kiss burning my lips!\"\\nshe cried.\\n\\nShe was like one stunned. What she had longed for, yearned for with all\\nthe intensity of her soul, was laid at her feet at last. But it was too\\nlate.\\n\\nHis love was offered her now, when she dared not claim it, dared not\\naccept it.\\n\\nIda rose the next morning with a heavy heart. She had slept the sleep\\nof exhaustion.\\n\\nEugene was surprised when she came down to the table, she looked so\\nchanged. There were heavy circles under her eyes, as though she had\\nbeen weeping.\\n\\nHe could not understand her. He was quite sure she would meet him with\\na happy, blushing face and downcast eyes. Ida would be glad when she\\ncould escape his wondering eyes. An hour later she was standing at the\\nwindow of the morning-room, which opened out on the terrace, her mind\\nin a tumult, when she heard Eugene\\'s voice at the other end of the\\nroom. She knew instinctively that he was looking for her. Only two days\\nago she would have waited there for him--would have eagerly sought the\\nopportunity of a few words with him; but now she hastily unfastened the\\nlong French window, and fled out into the grounds.\\n\\nEugene saw the flutter of the white figure hurrying down the terrace.\\n\\n\"She wishes to escape an encounter with me,\" he thought; and he was\\npuzzled.\\n\\nIda went to the further end of the garden, where the tall rose-bushes\\nhid her from human eyes. She sat down upon a little rustic bench and\\ntried to think. But her brain grew confused.\\n\\nOnly a short time ago she had cried out to Heaven to give her the love\\nof Eugene Mallard. Now that it was laid at her feet, what should she do?\\n\\n\"Heaven direct me,\" she cried out; \"I am so sorely tempted! I used to\\nwonder what people meant when they talked of the agony of death. Now I\\nknow.\"\\n\\nShe was frightened at the vehemence of her emotion; the memory of that\\ncaress made her tremble. She dreaded the moment when she should see\\nEugene alone again, but, woman-like, hoped that it would be soon. Her\\nheart was awakened at last. The sun of love shone in its glory upon her.\\n\\nIt had come to her, this woman\\'s heritage, this dower of passion and\\nsorrow, called love, changing the world into a golden gleam.\\n\\nHow was she ever to calm the fever that burned in her veins? Yes, she\\nloved him. She who had never, until she met Eugene Mallard, known what\\nlove meant; she, so young, beautiful, made so essentially for love, and\\nyet whose life had been so joyless and hopeless, loved at last.\\n\\nEugene Mallard noticed her avoidance of him during the week that\\nfollowed. She was trying to think out the problem in her own mind. Dare\\nshe drink of the cup of joy that he had pressed to her lips? In her\\nsimplicity, Ida thought that she had done much in denying herself a\\nlook at him.\\n\\nIf she had been the most accomplished of coquettes, she could not\\nhave chosen a method more calculating to awaken his interest than by\\navoiding him.\\n\\n\"She does not care for me as much as I thought,\" he told himself; and,\\nman-like, he felt a trifle piqued.\\n\\nHe had fancied that all he would have to do would be to ask her, and\\nshe would come straight to his arms.\\n\\nThis was, indeed, a new phase of her character. Yet he could not help\\nbut admire her maidenly modesty.\\n\\nHe would give her her own time to think over the proposition that he\\nhad laid before her. He would not seek her, would not intrude upon her.\\nHe looked at her more during that day than he had during all the time\\nshe had been under his roof.\\n\\nHe had not known before that she was so beautiful, so sweet, so\\nwomanly. How careless he had been in letting her go about by herself, a\\nprey for such rascals as Arthur Hollis!\\n\\nOnce he surprised her in the grounds. He had come up to her very\\nquietly.\\n\\n\"Ida,\" he said, \"have you forgotten that you have not so far answered\\nthe question I asked of you two weeks ago on the porch? Tell me, when\\nam I to claim my wife?\"\\n\\nHis wife! Great Heaven! Had she been mad, dreaming? What had she been\\ndoing? What had she done?\\n\\nHis wife! She was Royal Ainsley\\'s wife, and she could not belong to any\\nother man. She looked at him with the pallor of despair in her face,\\nthe shadow of death in her eyes.\\n\\nWhat had she been doing to think of love in connection with Eugene\\nMallard, when she was bound by the heaviest of chains? The shock was\\nterrible to her in those few minutes, and the wonder is that it did not\\nkill her.\\n\\n\"I must have your answer here and now,\" Eugene said, a trifle\\nimpatiently.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER L.\\n\\n\\nEugene Mallard, looking down at the lovely, terrified face, wondered\\nwhat there could be to frighten her so.\\n\\nHe was intending to do a kind action. That she should take the matter\\nin this fashion rather surprised him. He told himself that he could not\\nunderstand women and their ways.\\n\\n\"My reason for coming to this conclusion,\" he said, \"is that I am\\nintending to take a trip through the country, and desire that you shall\\naccompany me, Ida. We could not go as we are now, and lead the same\\nlife as we are living under this roof,\" he added, as she did not appear\\nto understand him. \"You understand what I mean?\" he asked.\\n\\nShe answered \"Yes,\" though he doubted very much if she really did\\ncomprehend his words.\\n\\n\"That will be a fortnight from now. It will give you plenty of time to\\nthink the matter over.\"\\n\\nWith these words he turned and left her.\\n\\nShe sank down into a garden-seat near by, her heart in a tumult. The\\nsheltered spot in which she sat was free from observation. The tall,\\nflowering branches screened her.\\n\\nDuring the days that followed, Eugene Mallard watched Ida sharply. If\\nthe girl loved him as well as she said she did, how strange it was that\\nshe was unwilling to come to him.\\n\\nOne day, while they were at the breakfast-table, the servant brought in\\nthe morning\\'s mail.\\n\\n\"Here is a letter for you, Ida,\" said Eugene, handing her a square\\nwhite envelope.\\n\\nOne glance at it, and her soul seemed to turn sick within her. It was\\nfrom Royal Ainsley!\\n\\nWhat had he to say to her? When he left her he promised that she should\\nnever see his face again, that he would never cross her path.\\n\\nWhat did this communication mean?\\n\\nBreakfast was over at last, and she hastened to the morning-room, where\\nshe could read her letter without being observed.\\n\\n \"MY LITTLE WIFE.--I am running in hard luck after all. I invested all\\n the money you were so generous as to give me, and lost every cent\\n of it. An open confession is good for the soul. Having told you the\\n truth, I feel better. I will need just the same amount of money to\\n float me, and you must raise it for me somehow. I use the word _must_\\n to duly impress it upon you. I will be at the same place where I met\\n you last, on the evening of the fourteenth. That will be just ten days\\n from the time you receive this letter. Do not fail me, Ida, or I might\\n be tempted to wreak vengeance upon my amiable cousin, fascinating\\n Eugene.\\n\\n     \"Yours in haste, and with much love,\\n\\n     \"ROYAL.\"\\n\\nShe flung the letter from her as though it were a scorpion. A look of\\nterror came over her face, her head throbbed, and her brain whirled.\\nOh, Heaven! the torture of it!\\n\\nWhat if he kept this up? It would not be long before she would be\\ndriven to madness.\\n\\n\"My little wife!\" How the words galled her; they almost seemed to take\\nher life away.\\n\\n\"He will torture me to madness,\" she thought, with the agony of despair.\\n\\nHow was she to raise the money to appease the man who was her\\nrelentless foe?\\n\\nThen she thought of her diamonds. Among the gifts which she had\\nreceived from Eugene was a diamond necklace. This he had inherited from\\nhis uncle.\\n\\n\"The setting is very old,\" he had said, \"because the necklace has been\\nworn by the ladies of our family for generations. The stones, however,\\nare remarkably white and brilliant. They are among the finest in this\\ncountry, and worth a fortune in themselves.\"\\n\\nShe had often looked at them as they lay in their rich purple-velvet\\ncase.\\n\\n\"I--I could raise the money on them,\" she thought, with a little sob.\\n\\nBut she did not know it was to end in a tragedy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LI.\\n\\n\\nIda no sooner found herself alone than she took from her wardrobe a\\nblack dress, a long cloak, a bonnet and black veil. She quickly donned\\nthem, then stole into the corridor, locking the door after her, and\\nputting the key in her pocket.\\n\\nIf she could get out of the house and into the grounds unobserved, all\\nwould be well. Fortune favored her; no one was in sight.\\n\\nShe made her way to the railway station, and bought a ticket for\\nWashington. On the train was quite a number of people whom she had met\\nbefore. But they did not recognize her with the veil pulled so closely\\nover her face.\\n\\nThe world seemed to stand still; but her heart seemed to beat wildly,\\nas she thought of it all.\\n\\nAt last Washington was reached, and for a minute she stood irresolute\\nas she stepped upon the platform of the depot. Then she timidly crossed\\nover to where a policeman stood.\\n\\n\"I--I would like to be directed to a pawn-broker\\'s store, if--if you\\nknow where there is one,\" she said.\\n\\nThe guardian of the peace looked at her suspiciously.\\n\\nIt was a part of his business to believe all strangers dishonest until\\nhe found them otherwise.\\n\\n\"Are you so much in need of money as to have to resort to that?\" he\\nasked, taking in the stylish make and fine texture of the clothes she\\nwore.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" she answered, timidly.\\n\\nThe policeman pointed to a store a couple of blocks further up, and Ida\\nstarted for the place indicated, after stopping to inquire when the\\ntrain returned to where she had come from.\\n\\nHe gave her the information, and watched her curiously until she was\\nout of sight.\\n\\n\"It is evident that she has come to Washington simply for the purpose\\nof pawning something. As soon as I reach the other end of my beat I\\nwill make it my business to step into Uncle Samuel\\'s and ask what she\\nhas disposed of. It is just as well for me to know.\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, Ida hurried quickly on her errand.\\n\\nThe pawn-broker\\'s clerk glanced up impatiently as the door opened and\\nthe dark-clad figure glided in.\\n\\n\"I--I should like to see the proprietor, to ask if he will advance me a\\nsum of money on some diamonds.\"\\n\\n\"Have you got them with you?\" asked the man, carelessly.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Ida, faintly; \"but can\\'t I see the proprietor?\"\\n\\n\"You can deal with me just as well,\" he answered.\\n\\nAfter a moment\\'s hesitation, Ida produced the package from her pocket,\\nand unwrapping it, disclosed the magnificent diamonds.\\n\\nA cry of surprise broke from the clerk\\'s lips. In all the years of his\\nlife he had never seen anything so grand as the diamond necklace. But,\\nlike all shrewd men in his calling, he carefully suppressed the cry of\\nastonishment.\\n\\n\"How much do you want to realize on this?\" he asked, indifferently.\\n\\n\"One thousand dollars,\" said Ida, faintly.\\n\\n\"Ha! ha! ha!\" he laughed. \"That\\'s pretty good, when you know full well\\nthat you couldn\\'t realize one-half that sum on them.\"\\n\\n\"But I shall have to!\" cried Ida.\\n\\nThe man closed his hand down over the lid.\\n\\n\"How did you come by these?\" he asked.\\n\\nHe saw the slender figure shiver.\\n\\n\"You have no right to ask me anything like that,\" she replied.\\n\\n\"Probably not,\" returned the man; \"still, when we don\\'t ask, we\\ngenerally do a great deal of guessing. But to end the matter, I will\\nadvance you a couple of hundred on them.\"\\n\\n\"I must have a thousand dollars,\" repeated Ida. \"If it were not\\nabsolutely necessary for me to raise the money on them, I should not\\nhave brought them here.\"\\n\\n\"Two hundred is a nice little sum,\" said the man. \"If you refuse to\\ntake that, I might take it into my head to hold you on suspicion, and\\ncall in a policeman. Bear in mind, I will give you that amount of money\\nwithout asking you where they came from. A policeman would want to\\nknow the whys and wherefores of the whole thing.\"\\n\\n\"I--I _must_ raise a thousand dollars on them,\" she reiterated,\\ngrasping the jewel-case.\\n\\nThe man\\'s bluff had not worked.\\n\\n\"That\\'s all _I\\'ll_ give; but father might accommodate you with a little\\nmore,\" he added, touching a little bell.\\n\\nThe summons was instantly answered by a short, stout little man who\\nlooked as if he had overheard the conversation.\\n\\nA quick glance passed between them.\\n\\n\"Here is something for you to decide,\" went on the young man. \"This\\nlady tells me that she wants a certain amount for these diamonds.\"\\n\\n\"I must have a thousand dollars,\" interposed Ida, \"and if you can\\nnot advance me that amount, do not detain me, please; I must look\\nelsewhere.\"\\n\\nAgain the lid was thrown back, and the casket exposed to the elder\\nman\\'s gaze. He fairly caught his breath as the blazing jewels met his\\neye. A wolfish expression leaped into his face.\\n\\n\"I think I can accommodate the lady,\" he said, blandly. \"My motto is to\\nplease the ladies even if I have to strain a point to do so.\"\\n\\nHe placed his hand in his pocket and brought forth a roll of bills.\\n\\n\"How will you have the money--in tens or twenties?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"It does not matter much,\" said Ida.\\n\\nHe handed her a roll of bills.\\n\\n\"You can count it, and see if the amount you wish is there,\" he said.\\n\\nShe counted it over with trembling hands. Yes, there was just a\\nthousand dollars there.\\n\\n\"You will take great care of the diamonds?\" she asked, eagerly.\\n\\n\"Certainly--certainly. They are as safe in my hands as though they were\\nin your own keeping, lady.\"\\n\\nShe put the money in her pocket, and hurried from the place.\\n\\n\"Abraham! Abraham!\" cried the old man, excitedly, as soon as the street\\ndoor had closed upon her, \"our fortune is made! This necklace is worth\\nat least a cool seventy-five thousand if it\\'s worth a penny, and we\\nhave got it in our possession for a paltry thousand dollars!\"\\n\\n\"I knew the diamonds were very fine, and worth a fortune,\" replied the\\nyoung man; \"but I did not know they were worth as much as that. What do\\nyou intend to do with them, father? You will have to give them up to\\nher if she claims them.\"\\n\\n\"Do you think I\\'m a fool!\" exclaimed the elder man, angrily. \"She\\'ll\\nnever lay eyes on those stones. Depend on that!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LII.\\n\\n\\nIda hurried back to the depot, purchased her ticket, and boarded the\\ntrain for home.\\n\\nShe had scarcely stepped from the ticket-agent\\'s window, ere the\\npoliceman who had directed her to the pawn-shop accosted the agent.\\n\\n\"Where did that veiled woman buy her ticket for? What is her\\ndestination?\" he whispered.\\n\\nHe told him, and the officer jotted down the name of the station in his\\nnote-book.\\n\\nWith the money securely in her possession, Ida reached home. Dusk had\\ncrept up; the stars were out in the sky.\\n\\nShe succeeded in gaining her own room unobserved. She was tired and\\nhungry; indeed, she had not thought of food since she had left the\\nhouse early in the day.\\n\\nShe threw off the long black cloak, the bonnet, thick veil, and black\\ndress she had worn on her visit to Washington. After bathing her face\\nin fragrant water and donning a silken house-robe, Ida rang the bell\\nfor her maid.\\n\\n\"Nora,\" she said, \"you may bring me a cup of tea and a biscuit.\"\\n\\n\"I am very glad that you are awake at last,\" said Nora. \"I wanted very\\nmuch to tell you something; but as you bid me not to disturb you on any\\naccount, I dared not come and knock on the door, ma\\'am.\"\\n\\n\"You are quite right,\" said Ida, wearily, \"not to disturb me. I needed\\nrest--rest,\" said Ida, brokenly.\\n\\n\"I wanted to tell you about the man who was skulking in the grounds.\\nI was hurrying along here a few moments ago, when some one sprung out\\nfrom behind the rose-bushes and grasped me by the arm.\\n\\n\"I certainly would have cried out with terror, but he put his hand over\\nmy mouth.\\n\\n\"\\'Keep still, and I won\\'t hurt you,\\' he said, with an oath.\\n\\n\"Trembling with terror, I stood still. I saw that he was a gentleman;\\nbut I noticed also that he was very much under the influence of wine.\\n\\n\"\\'Tell me, are you one of the maids from the house?\\' he asked.\\n\\n\"\\'Yes,\\' I answered.\\n\\n\"\\'Do you know me?\\' he questioned.\\n\\n\"\\'No,\\' I replied. \\'I am a stranger in the village. I have only been in\\nmy lady\\'s employ a little more than a fortnight.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'I want you to give your mistress _this_,\\' he said, producing an\\nenvelope from his pocket.\"\\n\\nShe did not add that the stranger had given her a bill to insure the\\nsafe delivery of his message, and to keep her from saying anything\\nabout it.\\n\\nAs the girl spoke, she produced an envelope.\\n\\nEven before the hapless Ida saw it, she knew full well from whom it\\ncame.\\n\\nPoor, hapless Ida! She sunk down into the nearest seat, white as she\\nwould ever be in death. She did not dare open it until after the girl\\nhad gone for the tea.\\n\\nShe drank it eagerly.\\n\\n\"Please bring me another cup, Nora,\" she said, \"stronger than the\\nfirst.\"\\n\\n\"I am afraid that you have a fever, my lady,\" said the girl, anxiously.\\n\\n\"I am only thirsty. You may as well take the biscuit back; I am afraid\\nit would choke me,\" said Ida.\\n\\n\"But you must be hungry,\" persisted the maid. \"I am sure you have eaten\\nnothing since breakfast time.\"\\n\\nWhen the girl had gone, Ida tore open the envelope, and read:\\n\\n \"My clever little wife, I am here a day earlier than I anticipated.\\n Meet me at once in the same place. Of course you have the money by\\n this time. Bring it with you.\"\\n\\nShe crushed the note in her hand. No one heard the gasping, the bitter\\nsob, the despairing cry she uttered. The iron had entered her soul.\\nThere was nothing but to obey his commands.\\n\\nThe girl had said that he was under the influence of wine.\\n\\nIda had seen him in that condition once before, and that was on his\\nbridal-eve, and the memory of it had never left her.\\n\\nHe was terrible enough when sober, but under the influence of liquor he\\nmight be a fiend.\\n\\nThe girl brought a second cup of tea, which Ida drank eagerly.\\n\\n\"Now, leave me, Nora,\" she said, \"and do not come again until I ring\\nfor you.\"\\n\\nWith trembling hands, Ida placed the money in her bosom, drew the black\\ncloak over her shoulders, and hurried into the grounds.\\n\\nTrembling with a vague apprehension, she sped by a path that was seldom\\nused down to the brook-side.\\n\\n\"True to your tryst!\" said a well-known voice. \"Fairest, cleverest of\\nwomen, how can I thank you enough for your promptness?\"\\n\\nShe stood still, cold as marble, her face ghastly white in the\\nflickering light of the stars.\\n\\n\"Have you no word for me?\" he cried, with a harsh, derisive laugh.\\n\"Have you no smile, no kiss, no kind word? Have you nothing to say to\\nme? You have no love, no light of welcome in your eyes, and yet you\\nloved me so dearly once, my sweet Ida? Do you remember? And now----\"\\n\\n\"You mocking demon!\" she panted, \"how dare you utter such words to me?\\nI wonder you are not afraid that Heaven will strike you dead where you\\nstand!\"\\n\\n\"Heaven strike me dead?\" he repeated. \"What a horrible idea! Afraid?\\nOh, no, my dear. You are the first charming creature I ever saw who\\nflew into such a rage because her husband was pleased to be sentimental\\nto her.\"\\n\\nHe heard her draw her breath hard. She stood before him white and\\ntrembling, her eyes filled with burning fire.\\n\\n\"Say, Ida, couldn\\'t you manage somehow to get the rest of the\\nmoney--the five thousand?\"\\n\\n\"No!\" she answered, pitifully.\\n\\n\"That\\'s only a bluff,\" he cried. \"But it won\\'t work with me!\"\\n\\n\"You have sworn eternal silence _now_!\" she cried; \"you have given your\\noath, and you dare not break it. I can not raise any more money!\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps you will pay that amount for a little secret which I possess,\\nmy lady,\" he said, mockingly.\\n\\n\"There is nothing more you could tell me that would interest me.\"\\n\\n\"We shall see,\" he replied, sneeringly.\\n\\nHe pulled from under his coat a dark-lantern, shot back the slide, and\\na flood of light illumined the scene. He drew a package from his pocket\\nand unwrapped it. Ida watched him like one in a dream.\\n\\nSuddenly an awful cry broke from her lips. One by one he took from the\\npackage the articles of clothing that had been worn by the little child\\nhe had secured from the village merchant\\'s wife.\\n\\nA cry awful to hear broke from her lips.\\n\\n\"I suppose, Ida, it isn\\'t the proper thing to keep a person in\\nsuspense,\" he cried. \"You deserted your little child--never once sought\\nto discover whether it were dead or alive. By the merest chance, I ran\\nacross it lately. I took possession of it, and I have it now.\"\\n\\n\"I can not, I will not believe you,\" she answered, quickly.\\n\\n\"Perhaps this will convince you,\" he said, reading aloud a letter from\\nthe superintendent of the foundling asylum where the child had been\\nplaced.\\n\\nIt gave a full account of all that could be ascertained of the hapless\\nmother of the child. As he read by the light of the dark-lantern, she\\nknew that it was all true.\\n\\nHer child alive!\\n\\nThe rapture of the thought was drowned in the horror that it was in\\nthis man\\'s possession.\\n\\nShe fell on her face in the long grass, mad with misery and despair.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LIII.\\n\\n\\nFor a moment it seemed as though the darkness of death had come over\\nIda.\\n\\n\"My revelation surprises you,\" Royal Ainsley said, with a most horrible\\nlaugh.\\n\\nThe laugh and the words recalled her to her senses. She sprung to her\\nfeet and faced him.\\n\\n\"Where is my child?\" she cried, wildly. \"Speak, for the love of Heaven,\\nI pray you.\"\\n\\n\"It will cost you just another thousand dollars to find that out. Bring\\nme that amount here to-morrow night at the same hour, and I will give\\nyou full information. Isn\\'t that fair enough?\"\\n\\nPleadings and prayers were alike unavailing.\\n\\n\"Do you suppose I am going to tell you for nothing, when I can make you\\npay handsomely?\"\\n\\n\"But I haven\\'t the money,\" she sobbed, \"and--and you know it!\"\\n\\n\"How did you get this thousand?\" he asked.\\n\\nThen Ida told him all.\\n\\n\"You were a fool to get rid of the diamonds before you had asked Eugene\\nMallard for the money and been refused. Go to him and ask him for the\\nmoney now. He does not know how to refuse a woman, and he will give it\\nto you.\"\\n\\n\"And if I refuse?\" she asked, desperately.\\n\\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n\"Then you and the man you love will be thrown into prison,\" Royal\\ndeclared, \"to serve a term of fifteen or twenty years. After that you\\ncan not complain as to how I brought up your daughter, if she follows\\nin the footsteps of her mother!\"\\n\\nHe could not have used a more conclusive argument.\\n\\n\"Have you no heart, man--no mercy?\" cried Ida.\\n\\n\"Come, come, I say, do not be theatrical; the role does not become you!\\nBetter be sensible, and consider the proposition I make you.\"\\n\\n\"I will leave you now,\" he said; \"but I will be here, at this same\\nhour, to-morrow night.\"\\n\\n\"No, no!\" she cried. \"Give me a week to think it over, and--and to see\\nwhat I can do about raising the money.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, a week, if you must have it,\" he replied; \"but no longer.\\nHere, you can take these proofs of my story regarding your child and\\nlook them over at your leisure,\" he said, thrusting the package into\\nher hand.\\n\\nThe next moment he was gone. She did not faint; she knew that if she\\ndid she would be found there with the package in her hand. She was so\\ndazed, so bewildered, she never remembered how she reached the house\\nand her own room. Again she rang the bell for Nora.\\n\\n\"You may bring me another cup of tea,\" she said, faintly, \"as strong as\\nthe last one.\"\\n\\nThe girl, noticing how pale and ill her mistress looked, thought it\\nwould be best to bring her a glass of wine as well.\\n\\n\"Unless I am very much mistaken, she has a sick spell coming on. Her\\nface is pale, but every now and then it flushes burning red.\"\\n\\nIda did not seek her couch that night until she had eagerly scanned\\nevery article of clothing the parcel contained.\\n\\nHer excitement knew no bounds as she read the letter from the\\nsuperintendent of the foundling asylum, concerning all that he knew\\nof the baby\\'s parentage, in which he stated that the doctor who had\\nattended the young mother had brought the child to the institution in a\\ndying condition, as he supposed, and was hastily called abroad, and had\\nbarely time to make the outgoing steamer. He had told them that they\\ncould tell the hapless young mother when she was able to bear the sad\\nnews.\\n\\nIda wept as she had never wept before as she read those written words,\\nand her excitement increased as she saw that the letter was directed\\nto the village merchant\\'s wife, Mrs. Lester, who had taken the child.\\n\\nIt was, then, her own child that she had clasped in her arms, the eyes\\nof her own babe into which she had gazed with such agony and yet with\\nsuch rapture.\\n\\nThen another fear seized her. She had not seen the little one for weeks.\\n\\nWas it ill? Had anything happened to it? She could not visit Mrs.\\nLester\\'s home until the day broke.\\n\\nHow came her little child in the possession of Royal Ainsley?\\n\\nThe suspense which she endured almost drove her insane. The next\\nmorning she was up as early as the servants were.\\n\\n\"Joe,\" she said to the old coachman, \"I want you to harness up the\\nswiftest horses you have in the stable, and take me to the village. I\\nwant to go to the store kept by the Lesters.\"\\n\\n\"You will not find it open so early in the mornin\\', ma\\'am,\" declared\\nJoe. \"Dem village folk am pow\\'ful lazy.\"\\n\\n\"We will go to their garden, and perhaps be fortunate enough to find\\nthem there,\" said Ida, eagerly. \"Harness the horses at once, Joe.\"\\n\\nThe hapless young mother scarcely breathed during that ride.\\n\\nAfter what seemed to her almost an endless ride, they drew up before\\nthe village store kept by the Lesters.\\n\\nAs Joe had predicted, the door was closed, and the blinds drawn.\\n\\n\"There they are in the garden yonder; at least, there am Mrs. Lester\\nin the strawberry-patch, and there am her husband, off further in the\\nfields.\"\\n\\n\"I will go to her,\" said Ida, stepping quickly from the carriage.\\n\\nSo busy was Mrs. Lester with her task of gathering the ripe fruit, that\\nshe did not know of the presence of her visitor until she stood beside\\nher.\\n\\n\"Mrs. Lester,\" said a quick, eager, husky voice, \"I do hope I have not\\nsurprised you this morning.\"\\n\\n\"Well, well, you have surprised me, for a fact. I suppose you want to\\nget something from the store.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I do, but not just now,\" returned Ida, with feverish impatience.\\n\"Let me sit down here a few moments and talk with you.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" said the woman; \"but I haven\\'t anything out here to invite\\nyou to sit upon, save that little garden-seat which I always take\\naround with me, so that I can rest myself when I get tired.\"\\n\\n\"It will do very well, thank you,\" said Ida, feeling so weak and faint\\nthat she could hardly stand.\\n\\n\"I have not seen you nor your little child lately,\" began Ida.\\n\\nThen she stopped short, lest her quivering voice should betray her\\nterrible anxiety.\\n\\n\"No,\" returned Mrs. Lester. \"I no longer have the little one, bless its\\npoor, dear little heart!\"\\n\\n\"Has anything happened to it?\" asked Ida, the agony of death in her\\nvoice. \"Oh, tell me, where is it? Is the little baby dead?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LIV.\\n\\n\\nIt seemed to Ida that it took ages for the woman to reply. She leaned\\nforward breathlessly, fairly devouring her with her dark, dilated eyes.\\n\\n\"Oh, no! the baby did not die,\" said Mrs. Lester, \"although it was a\\nweak, puny little thing.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll just tell you all about it, for I feel just like talking it over\\nwith some one.\\n\\n\"The child required so much care that my husband decided we could not\\nkeep it, and I was on my way to take it back to the foundling asylum in\\nNew York, when the strangest thing happened.\\n\\n\"In the depot I met a young man who used to live in the village. His\\nname is Royal Ainsley.\"\\n\\n\"Yes! yes!\" interposed Ida, faintly, feeling almost more dead than\\nalive.\\n\\n\"I was telling him all about the baby, showing him the letters that\\ncame with it, and the proofs I had of its identity, when he suddenly\\nexclaimed:\\n\\n\"\\'I will tell you in a few words what I\\'ll do. I\\'ll take this little\\none back to New York, and save you the trip!\\'\\n\\n\"He offered me one hundred dollars to give him the child then and\\nthere. We are very poor, Mrs. Mallard, and a hundred dollars seemed a\\nfortune to me.\\n\\n\"It\\'s over a fortnight since that occurred, but I have not ceased to\\nworry about it, I assure you.\"\\n\\nYoung Mrs. Mallard suddenly staggered to her feet and turned away.\\n\\n\"I think I will not wait any longer,\" said Ida, in a strangely altered\\nvoice. \"Good-morning, Mrs. Lester!\"\\n\\nThe next moment she hurried down the garden-path, and entered her\\ncarriage.\\n\\nLike one wild with terror, Ida hurried back to the carriage and\\nre-entered it.\\n\\n\"Home!\" she said; and old Joe was surprised at the sound of her voice,\\nit was so unnatural.\\n\\n\"What Royal Ainsley told me is indeed too true!\" she said to herself,\\nwith an inward moan. \"He has possession of my little child. Only Heaven\\nknows how he will use his power to crush me, and the fair, sweet,\\ninnocent babe as well!\"\\n\\nIt seemed to her as though the very thought of it would drive her mad.\\nShe knew she was in his power, and that he would certainly use that\\npower to extort every dollar from her that he possibly could. And then,\\nwhen there was no more money to be gained, what would he do?\\n\\nShe avoided Eugene Mallard during the next few days, lest he should\\nrepeat the question he had asked when he last talked with her.\\n\\nHe watched her in wonder. Her apparent coyness amused as well as\\nsurprised him.\\n\\n\"There is no way of understanding women,\" he said to himself. \"To-day\\nthey are eager for something; to-morrow they will not have it!\"\\n\\nHe was surprised when he received a message from her one day, asking\\nhim if she could see him alone in the library.\\n\\nHe sent back a reply in the affirmative, and awaited her coming with\\nsome curiosity, no doubt entering his mind as to what she wished to say.\\n\\nIt was some time before she put in an appearance. He was not aware of\\nher presence, he was gazing so intently out of the window, until she\\nstood by his side.\\n\\n\"Mr. Mallard,\" she began, hesitatingly, \"please pardon me for intruding\\nupon you; but I could not wait.\"\\n\\nHe looked down wonderingly at the lovely young face so strangely pale.\\n\\n\"Would it not be as well for my wife to address me as Eugene?\" he\\nasked, with a grave smile.\\n\\nShe looked up at him and tried to utter the word; but somehow it seemed\\nas though she could not.\\n\\nMy wife!\\n\\nHow those words cut her! If they had been the sharp thrust of a sword,\\nthey could not have cut her deeper.\\n\\nHis wife!\\n\\nShe would have given everything in this world if indeed it were true\\nthat she was Eugene Mallard\\'s wife.\\n\\nAnother face rose before her vision--a fair, handsome, sneering\\nface--and she drew back with a shudder.\\n\\nHe noticed it, and the kindly words he was about to utter were hushed\\non his lips.\\n\\nAfter placing a chair for her, and taking one near it, he waited for\\nher to proceed.\\n\\n\"I--I have come to ask your indulgence in a little matter,\" she said,\\nfaintly.\\n\\n\"Yes?\" he said, kindly.\\n\\nFor a moment there was silence between them--a deep, painful, awkward\\nsilence, which was broken at length by Ida.\\n\\n\"I have been looking over some furniture,\" she said, tremulously,\\n\"and--and I could use just double the amount of money you gave me.\\nWould you be very, very angry if I asked you for a thousand dollars\\nmore?\"\\n\\nHe threw back his head and laughed outright.\\n\\n\"One would think, by the manner in which you express yourself, that\\nyou were suing for some great favor, the granting of which you doubted.\"\\n\\nShe looked at him with dilated eyes, the color coming and going in her\\nface.\\n\\nShe could not understand, by his remark, whether or not he intended\\ngiving it to her.\\n\\nHe turned at once to his desk, saying:\\n\\n\"I will write out a check for the amount you wish.\"\\n\\n\"No; not a check, please,\" she answered, piteously. \"I would so much\\nrather have the money.\"\\n\\nHe looked surprised.\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t the amount you wish,\" he said. \"I have not half that amount\\nprobably. I always use checks in preference to carrying money about\\nwith me.\"\\n\\nHe was quite mystified at the look of terror that crept into her eyes.\\n\\n\"I must have it in cash,\" she said, imploringly. \"Could you not get it\\nfor me somehow?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--certainly,\" he replied. \"When will you want it?\"\\n\\n\"To-night,\" she answered, piteously.\\n\\n\"You shall have it,\" he answered.\\n\\nBut there flashed through his mind a suspicion he would have given\\nanything to have removed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LV.\\n\\n\\nEugene Mallard thought long and earnestly after Ida had left him: \"What\\ncan Ida want with the cash, and in so short a time?\"\\n\\nHe put on his hat, went round to the stables, and ordered his horse. A\\ncanter over the hills would drive away these gloomy, unhappy thoughts.\\n\\nThe sun had crept to its zenith, and was now sinking toward the west as\\nhe reined his horse before the little village inn at Hampton Corners.\\n\\nEvery one knew Eugene Mallard. The proprietor of the hotel on the old\\nVirginia turnpike road warmly welcomed him. He had concluded to rest a\\nlittle and refresh his horse.\\n\\nAs he lighted his cigar and sat down on the porch, the first person he\\nsaw was Dora Staples.\\n\\n\"I am really so delighted to see you, Mr. Mallard,\" she said in her\\npretty lisping accent.\\n\\n\"I had not expected to see you before the fourteenth. We have not had\\nan acknowledgment of the invitation to our ball which we sent you and\\nyour wife a week ago; but I feel sure you won\\'t disappoint us. We count\\nupon you two as our most particular guests.\"\\n\\nEugene flushed hotly.\\n\\n\"Oh, certainly,\" he said. \"I hope you will pardon my not answering your\\nkind favor at once. I will see that my wife writes you and accepts the\\ninvitation.\"\\n\\n\"By the way,\" went on Dora. \"I saw Mr. Hollis only yesterday. We went\\nto Richmond to do some shopping, and the first person I met was Mr.\\nHollis. I am sure he tried to avoid me, though he says he didn\\'t. I\\ntold him about the ball, as I did not know where to send the invitation\\nto him. I told him that you and Mrs. Mallard would be there, and that\\nall we now needed to make the affair as pleasant as the one at your\\nhouse was his presence.\\n\\n\"\\'I will come if I can,\\' he said; \\'but don\\'t feel hard toward me if\\nI should fail to be there. I have a matter of considerable importance\\non hand for that date, and I do not know just how I will be able to\\narrange it.\\'\"\\n\\nEugene Mallard drove slowly homeward. Although he tried to banish\\nDora\\'s words from his mind, yet they still haunted him.\\n\\nWhat was Arthur Hollis doing in Richmond? He was more puzzled over it\\nthan he cared to own.\\n\\nAs he rode up to the door, he saw Ida on the veranda, talking to a\\ngroup of friends. It then struck him as it had never struck him before\\nthat his young wife was very handsome; and he was beginning to wonder\\nhow it was that he had been so blind as to not see that which was\\nattracting the attention of every one else.\\n\\nShe wore a tight-fitting dress of pale-blue silk, with a crimson rose\\nin its bodice. She held a bunch of roses in her white hand. There were\\nseveral other ladies present, but not one of them could compare with\\nher.\\n\\nFor the first time since his marriage a feeling of exultation stole\\ninto his heart at the thought that this peerless creature belonged\\nsolely to him.\\n\\nThey were speaking of the grand ball the Staples\\'s were to give, and\\ncommenting on what they were going to wear.\\n\\n\"How about _you_, Mrs. Mallard? What are _you_ going to wear? Don\\'t\\nkeep what you are going to wear a secret, and then spring some\\nwonderful creation upon our wondering gaze.\"\\n\\n\"I assure you,\" said Ida, \"that I have no intention of doing anything\\nof the kind. Indeed,\" she declared, earnestly, \"in sending out the\\ninvitations, I am _sure_ they have forgotten us!\"\\n\\nAt this juncture, Eugene stepped forward, saying:\\n\\n\"Is there any excuse a man can offer for forgetting so great a favor\\nas an invitation to a grand ball? That is exactly what has occurred.\\nI received the invitation for the Staples\\'s ball one day last\\nweek. I should have taken it direct to my wife, but you know that\\n\\'procrastination is the thief of time.\\' It has proved so in this case.\\nI laid it down, and in the press of other matters, I forgot it. My\\npapers must have covered it, and the matter entirely escaped my mind\\nuntil to-day.\"\\n\\n\"Of course you will go?\" remarked the ladies in chorus.\\n\\n\"Oh, yes; we are sure to do so,\" he responded.\\n\\nA little later he found Ida alone in the drawing-room.\\n\\n\"I do hope you will look your best at this particular ball,\" he said.\\n\"The governor of the State; in fact, any number of my old friends will\\nbe there. I want you to wear your most becoming dress, and all the\\nfamily diamonds.\"\\n\\nIda had been looking down calmly at the roses she held. But as mention\\nof the diamonds fell from her husband\\'s lips, a change that was\\nalarming came over her face.\\n\\nShe grew white as death; her eyes lost their light. The roses which she\\nheld fell to her feet.\\n\\n\"Why, Ida, you look as if it were an occasion for sorrow instead of one\\nof joy,\" Eugene remarked.\\n\\n\"What is the date of the ball?\" she asked.\\n\\n\"The fourteenth,\" he responded.\\n\\nAgain that ashen pallor spread over her face, leaving it white to the\\nlips.\\n\\nThat was the date upon which Royal Ainsley was to bring her child to\\nher.\\n\\nWhat was the great ball to her compared with this event?\\n\\nWhile in the village Eugene had got the money she had asked of him. He\\nhad handed it to her inclosed in an envelope.\\n\\nOh, how kind and good he was to her! How very despicable it was to\\ndeceive him! But what could she do? Fate was against her.\\n\\nEugene could not help but notice the intense excitement under which she\\nlabored during the time that elapsed to the coming of the ball. She\\nlonged, yet dreaded to have the day arrive.\\n\\nThe day came at last, bright and clear. There was no cloud in the blue\\nsky; the sun shone brightly in the heavens. She was glad that there\\nwere several guests at the house, as her husband would not have much\\nopportunity of observing her.\\n\\nHow that day passed she never knew. One moment she was as white as\\ndeath, the next she flushed as red as a rose.\\n\\n\"Heaven help me to live over the excitement of to-day!\" she murmured,\\nclasping her hands tightly.\\n\\nShe prayed for the noonday to linger. But time, which stays at no man\\'s\\nbidding, rolled on. The sun went down in a sweep of crimson glory; dusk\\ngathered and deepened into the darkness of night.\\n\\nSeven o\\'clock sounded from the pearl-and-gold clock on the mantel.\\nSeven o\\'clock resounded from the great brass-throated clock in the main\\nhall.\\n\\n\"Nora,\" said Ida to her maid, \"go down to the library and tell Mr.\\nMallard that I am indisposed and can not go with him to the ball, but\\nthat I earnestly pray he will go without me, and enjoy himself. Say\\nthat I wish particularly that he should go; and notice what he says,\\nNora, and come back and tell me.\"\\n\\nIt seemed to Ida that Nora would never deliver the message.\\n\\nWhy did she linger? At last the girl returned.\\n\\n\"What did he say, Nora?\" she asked, breathlessly, fixing her startled\\neyes eagerly on the girl\\'s face.\\n\\n\"He made no reply, ma\\'am,\" returned Nora; \"but I am sure he will go,\\nsince you so earnestly requested it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LVI.\\n\\n\\nIt was with the greatest surprise that Eugene Mallard received the\\nmessage that Nora delivered--that Ida was too ill to attend the grand\\nball with him.\\n\\n\"She did not seem to be ill this afternoon,\" he said to himself.\\n\\nObeying a sudden impulse, he hurried from the room, intent upon going\\nto Ida\\'s _boudoir_ and offering her his sympathy; but, on second\\nthought, he concluded that in all probability she would not care to be\\ndisturbed.\\n\\nHe felt grievously disappointed. He knew that many of his friends would\\nbe present; and besides, what could he say to Mrs. Staples and her\\ndaughters?\\n\\nSome of her friends had left Ida apparently in the best of health\\nand spirits at noon. How could he account to them for her sudden\\nindisposition?\\n\\nDuring the forenoon he saw that there was something on Ida\\'s mind; that\\nshe was greatly troubled.\\n\\nPerhaps the words he had said to her only a short time before had much\\nto do with her indisposition. He felt that he ought to have a talk with\\nIda. If he were to reassure her that she could have everything her own\\nway, she might feel much relieved.\\n\\nA second time he started for her _boudoir_; but again he drew back. He\\ncould not tell what prompted him to do so.\\n\\n\"Such strange, contradictory emotions seem to possess me,\" he said. \"I\\nwill go out into the grounds and smoke a cigar. That will quiet me a\\nlittle, and afterward I will have a talk with Ida.\"\\n\\nEugene Mallard wandered about the grounds for half an hour or more. He\\nheard a clock strike the hour of eight.\\n\\nHow dark and gloomy it was! There was no moon, but the stars shed a\\nfaint, glimmering light.\\n\\nHe had smoked a cigar; but still he paced aimlessly up and down the\\ngrounds, lost in thought.\\n\\nHe came to one of the garden benches. It looked so inviting that he\\nthrew himself down upon it.\\n\\nHow long he sat there he never knew. Presently he was disturbed by the\\nsound of slow, cautious footsteps. It could not be one of the servants\\nstealing through the grounds in that manner. It must be some poacher.\\n\\nHe drew back into the shadow of the trees, and watched with no little\\ncuriosity. He had been so kind to the villagers that he felt surprised\\nat this apparent ingratitude.\\n\\nPresently a figure came down the path. The more he watched the figure\\nthe more certain he became that he had seen it before. Its every move\\nseemed familiar to him.\\n\\nSuddenly a thought flashed into his mind that made him hold his breath.\\n\\n\"Great Heavens! can it be Arthur Hollis?\" he ejaculated.\\n\\nHis face paled; great flashes of fire seemed to come from his eyes. The\\nvery blood in his veins seemed to stagnate. Faint and dizzy, he leaned\\nback against the trunk of a tree.\\n\\nGreat God! what could it mean? His wife supposed him to be by this time\\non his way to the ball. During his absence would she meet, dared she\\nmeet Arthur Hollis?\\n\\nThe tall, familiar-looking figure paced impatiently by the brook-side\\nunder the dim light of the stars. Yes, the man was there waiting for\\nsome one.\\n\\nFrom where he stood he could plainly see a faint light in the window\\nof his wife\\'s room, and as his eyes were fixed upon it, the light was\\nextinguished.\\n\\nIf a sword had been plunged into Eugene Mallard\\'s heart, it could not\\nhave given him a greater shock.\\n\\nMany a night he had paced up and down the grounds, watching the light\\nin that window. Then it had never been put out before ten. Why should\\nit be extinguished so early to-night?\\n\\nThe thought troubled Eugene Mallard, as he turned his head and saw the\\nfigure still pacing restlessly up and down by the brook.\\n\\nHe dared not utter a word. He would await developments. He scarcely\\nbreathed, in his suspense. It seemed to him that the blood in his veins\\nwas turned to ice.\\n\\nHe took up a position where there was no possible danger of being\\nobserved, and there he watched and waited.\\n\\nUp in her _boudoir_ Ida was donning with trembling hands, the long\\ncloak that was to disguise her.\\n\\nShe had sent Nora from her room. But it seemed to her that the girl\\nlooked back suspiciously as she went out and closed the door after her.\\n\\n\"Heaven help me to get through with this exciting scene!\" Ida muttered.\\n\\nHer heart was throbbing so, her limbs were so weak, that she was\\nobliged to sit down for a minute.\\n\\n\"Oh, Heaven help me! How thankful I am that Eugene did not send for me\\nbefore he left for the ball. He has reached there by this time!\" she\\nmuttered.\\n\\nShe looked at the clock, and said to herself that time was flying, and\\nshe must hasten to keep her appointment.\\n\\nAgain she counted over the money which Eugene had given her--the money\\nthat was to restore her little child to her--the money that was to\\npurchase her freedom and end forever Royal Ainsley\\'s persecutions.\\n\\n\"What would Eugene say if he knew all?\" she asked herself, in great\\ntrepidation.\\n\\nShe trembled even at the thought of it.\\n\\nWas she doing right in concealing the truth from Eugene Mallard?\\n\\nShe sprung from her chair and paced hurriedly up and down the room.\\n\\nIf Eugene knew all, he would certainly tell her that her path lay with\\nRoyal Ainsley, that his roof would shelter her no more. And now she\\ncould not part from him. Every fiber of her heart was woven about him.\\n\\nShe tried to look into the future; but, think what she would, the\\npictures presented frightened her.\\n\\nPresently she paused before the window. Was it only her fancy, or did\\nshe hear the patter of rain-drops?\\n\\nShe turned out the light and threw open the window. She felt relieved\\nto find that it was only the leaves that were tapping against the\\nwindow-pane. She closed the window, with a sigh, and opened the door\\nsoftly.\\n\\nThe corridor was empty; the gas-jets of the great chandelier were\\nturned low. Like a thief in the night, she stole noiselessly down the\\nwinding passageway.\\n\\nThe sound of laughter from the servants\\' hall below floated up to her\\nthrough the awful stillness.\\n\\nWhat if one of the doors on either side should open, and some one step\\nout and confront her?\\n\\nShe drew her long cloak closely about her, and pulled the hood down\\nover her head.\\n\\nThere was a side door opening on to a porch, and leading directly into\\nthe grounds.\\n\\nIda hurried toward this door and opened it cautiously. For a moment\\nshe stood on the threshold, and in that moment a gust of wind blew the\\ncloak from about her shoulders, and it fell at her feet.\\n\\nThe light from the hall lamp clearly revealed her form to Eugene\\nMallard, who stood leaning against an oak-tree scarcely one hundred\\nfeet distant.\\n\\n\"It is Ida!\" he muttered, hoarsely.\\n\\nShe turned her steps down toward the brook, as he had feared she would\\ndo.\\n\\n\"She stayed away from the ball to meet that scoundrel!\" he muttered\\nunder his breath.\\n\\nWith hesitating steps, little dreaming of what the end of her adventure\\nwould be, Ida hurried on to her doom.\\n\\nThe wind sighed a mournful requiem in the trees, the songs of the birds\\nwere hushed, and the sweet murmur of the brook seemed to end in a sob\\nas it rushed onward to the sea.\\n\\nThe night was warm, but a great shiver crept over Ida as she turned out\\nof the path and hurried along through the garden by a short cut to the\\nplace where she knew Royal Ainsley was impatiently waiting for her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LVII.\\n\\n\\nRoyal Ainsley was not a man to be trusted when under the influence of\\ndrink. As the minutes went by, and Ida did not come, he was beside\\nhimself with rage.\\n\\n\"What does she mean by keeping me waiting in this manner?\" he roared.\\n\"By the Lord Harry, I\\'ll make her pay for this!\"\\n\\nThen, like Eugene Mallard, who was watching but a few feet from him, he\\nsaw the light go out in Ida\\'s room.\\n\\n\"That must be _her_ room. She is coming at last,\" he murmured.\\n\\nHe braced himself against the trunk of a tree, for by this time his\\nlimbs were none too steady under him.\\n\\nWhen the door opened, and he saw Ida approach, an exclamation of\\nsatisfaction broke from his lips.\\n\\nHe sat down upon the mossy rock and watched the slim figure as it moved\\nslowly over the greensward.\\n\\n\"She is certainly in no hurry to see me,\" he muttered, with a grim\\nsmile. \"But I\\'ll change all that.\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, Ida had stopped short, and was standing motionless in the\\npath.\\n\\nPutting her hand into the pocket of her dress, the girl found, to her\\ngreat amazement, that she had come away without the roll of bills she\\nhad intended to bring with her. In her excitement she had left the\\nmoney on the table.\\n\\nWhat should she do? There was no course to pursue but go back for it.\\n\\nThen a superstitious terror for which she could not account seemed to\\nseize her.\\n\\n\"It will surely be a bad omen to return to the house.\" she told\\nherself; \"and yet I dare not meet Royal Ainsley without the money. He\\nwill say that my story about forgetting the money is only an excuse.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LVIII.\\n\\n\\nAs Ida paused for a moment, wondering what course would be best to\\npursue, she concluded that her only course would be to return to the\\nhouse for the money.\\n\\nShe had scarcely turned, before a piercing cry sounded through the\\ngrounds, coming from the direction of the brook.\\n\\nIda, terrified, stood for a moment rooted to the spot. She tried to\\nfly, but if her life had depended upon it, she could not have stirred\\nhand or foot.\\n\\nShe distinctly heard the sound of voices. Still, all power to fly\\nseemed to have left her.\\n\\nWhat could it be? Had some of the servants discovered Royal Ainsley\\'s\\npresence?\\n\\nShe tried to think, but she was powerless. Every sound seemed confusing.\\n\\nGuided by the light, Nora had dashed quickly down toward the brook.\\nBut ere she could reach the figure pacing up and down so impatiently,\\nshe was seized from behind by a pair of strong arms, a white angry\\nface bent over her, and a voice, which she instantly recognized as her\\nmaster\\'s, cried harshly:\\n\\n\"Let me understand what this means!\"\\n\\nThe girl was too frightened to speak.\\n\\n\"This is why you would not come to the ball, is it?\" he cried,\\nexcitedly, dragging her toward the spot where her lover stood. \"Come,\\nyou and I will confront the lover whom you stayed away from the ball to\\nmeet here!\"\\n\\nRoyal Ainsley took in the situation at once. He recognized Eugene\\'s\\nvoice.\\n\\n\"He has discovered Ida Mallard\\'s appointment with me in some way,\" he\\nthought. And the knowledge terrified him, coward as he was.\\n\\nHe turned and beat a hasty retreat, dodging directly into the arms of\\nold Joe.\\n\\n\"Ha! I\\'ve caught you _this_ time!\" cried the old servitor.\\n\\nWith an oath, Royal Ainsley flung Joe from him.\\n\\n\"Out of my way!\" he cried, fiercely, \"or I\\'ll kill you!\"\\n\\nThe voice, as well as the words, startled old Joe, and threw him\\nentirely off his guard for an instant. In that instant a heavy blow was\\ndealt him which caused him to loosen his hold on the intruder.\\n\\nThen Royal Ainsley sped like a deer through the grounds, every foot of\\nwhich he knew well, and was quickly lost to sight in the darkness.\\n\\nAfter that first sharp cry, Nora regained something of her natural\\nbravado.\\n\\nIn less time than it takes to tell it, her master had dragged her\\ntoward the house and under the full light of the swinging lamp.\\n\\n\"Oh, master!\" she cried, gaining her breath at last \"It\\'s I, Nora, the\\nmaid!\"\\n\\nEugene Mallard\\'s tightly clinched hands fell from her; he stared aghast\\nat the girl.\\n\\n\"You, Nora!\" he cried, in the greatest amazement, with a world of\\nrelief and thankfulness blended in his voice.\\n\\n\"Pray for--forgive me, Mr. Mallard,\" sobbed the girl. \"I--I did not do\\nany intentional wrong. I was only going down to the old south gate to\\nmeet my lover, sir. I--I did not think for a moment that any one would\\nmind. My lady did not need me for an hour or more. Oh, please forgive\\nme if my action has displeased you!\"\\n\\n\"It was your lover that you were going to meet?\" repeated Eugene\\nMallard, as if to satisfy himself that he had heard aright.\\n\\nHe drew back and looked at Nora with fixed intentness, the color that\\nhad left his face surging back to it again.\\n\\nEugene Mallard now walked to his library, and flung himself down to\\nthink over the situation.\\n\\nHe felt grateful beyond words that matters were no worse. He was\\nashamed of the thought that for a moment had found lodgment in his\\nbrain against the wife whom he had wedded.\\n\\nThen it came to him--his love for Ida, whom he knew now that he\\nworshipped with all the passionate love of his heart. How different it\\nwas from the love he had borne Hildegarde Cramer!\\n\\nHe wondered that he had been so blind as not to have noticed his love\\nfor her sooner. He could scarcely wait until the day dawned, that\\nhe might go to her and tell her of the great love for her that was\\nconsuming his soul.\\n\\nHe said to himself that it was only her innate modesty that caused her\\nto hold aloof from him of late, and to make her hesitate about giving\\nhim her answer.\\n\\nHe looked shudderingly backward over the past for the last time. Yes,\\nhe would urge her to give him his answer on the morrow. It never once\\noccurred to him but that her answer would be \"Yes.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LIX.\\n\\n\\nWhen Royal Ainsley shook himself free from old Joe\\'s detaining grasp,\\nhis first impulse was to get as far away from the place as possible.\\n\\nWith second thoughts, however, came another decision. No; he must learn\\nall that was taking place.\\n\\nQuickly circling the grounds, he soon gained a vantage-place behind a\\ngroup of bushes not far from the house. There he could easily see and\\nhear all that transpired without being seen himself.\\n\\nHe saw Eugene Mallard as he drew the girl beneath the swinging lamp in\\nthe hall, and heard the conversation that passed between them.\\n\\n\"So!\" he muttered, grinding his white teeth savagely, \"the girl is my\\nlady\\'s maid, eh? I dare say, she sent her with some message to me when\\nshe was intercepted by Eugene Mallard. But Ida will find that this will\\nnot work with me. See her I shall, if I have to stay in these grounds\\ntill broad daylight.\"\\n\\nHe watched and waited until he saw even old Joe relax his vigilance and\\ngo into the house.\\n\\nRoyal Ainsley waited there until the old mansion was wrapped in gloom\\nand darkness, then he slipped from his hiding-place, passed noiselessly\\nover the graveled walk, and stood beneath Ida\\'s window.\\n\\nStooping, he caught up a handful of pebbles. One by one he flung them\\nup against the window-pane. Just as he had expected, he saw a white,\\nterrified face appear at the window, and two white hands threw up the\\nsash.\\n\\nHe saw at once that it was Ida. He moved out from the shadow of the\\ntrees. She saw him at once, and recognized him.\\n\\n\"Is it _you_?\" she cried, in the greatest alarm. \"What in Heaven\\'s name\\nare you doing there, pray?\"\\n\\n\"Your common sense ought to tell you _that_;\" he retorted, harshly.\\n\"Come down here at once, I tell you, and be sure to bring that money\\nwith you!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no! no! I can not!\" she answered him, piteously.\\n\\n\"Why?\" he demanded, with something very much like an imprecation upon\\nhis lips.\\n\\n\"I dropped the money in the dining-room as I was passing through it to\\nget out into the grounds. The room is locked; I can not get it until\\nto-morrow morning. Old Joe always carries the key with him.\"\\n\\n\"It is a lie!\" he cried, fiercely.\\n\\n\"No! no! On my life, it is true!\" she answered, with a piteous quiver\\nin her voice; adding: \"I was hurrying through the room, and there I\\nmust have dropped it. I searched for it in every other place.\"\\n\\n\"Then hear what I say,\" he retorted, with an oath, \"in these very\\ngrounds I shall stay until you come to me. I know well that old Joe is\\nastir at dawn. You must be up then, find the money which you say you\\ndropped, and bring it out to me. I will be waiting for you at the same\\nplace.\"\\n\\nBefore she could utter a word of protest, he had turned and disappeared\\nin the darkness.\\n\\nAll night long Ida Mallard paced the floor of her room, scarcely\\nheeding the hours that dragged their slow lengths by. Dawn came before\\nshe realized it. She was startled from her reverie by hearing old Joe\\nthrowing open the shutters about the house. That recalled her to a\\nrealization of passing events.\\n\\nJoe had unlocked the door of the dining-room at last, but his sight was\\nso poor that he could not espy a small roll of bills lying on the floor.\\n\\nIda, gliding into the room as soon as his footsteps echoed down the\\ncorridor, found the package.\\n\\nShe stole to the door as soon as it was unlocked.\\n\\nAh! how sweet and fragrant was the early morning. How cool and green\\nthe grass looked, wet with the morning dew! Little she dreamed that ere\\nthe day waned that same grass would be dyed with a human being\\'s blood.\\n\\nShe shivered as she stepped forth into the grounds. With hurried steps\\nshe crossed the lawn, and went into the rose-garden beyond. There she\\nsaw Royal Ainsley. He was pacing the little path by the brook, his face\\nwhite, his eyes angry-looking, downcast and sullen.\\n\\n\"So you have come at last, eh?\" he exclaimed, angrily.\\n\\n\"I am here,\" she responded, tremulously.\\n\\n\"I was just about to go and wake up the household,\" he cried, his rage\\nincreasing.\\n\\n\"Now, that I am here, you will not have to do that,\" she answered,\\nwearily.\\n\\n\"Where is the money?\" he asked, abruptly.\\n\\nShe held it in her hand, but clutched it more tightly.\\n\\n\"I have it with me,\" she responded; \"but it is not yours until you\\ncarry out your promises!\"\\n\\nHe looked at her with a cunning gleam in his eyes.\\n\\n\"To be sure I will carry out my agreement,\" he said.\\n\\n\"But I must have proof that you will do so before I part with so much\\nmoney,\" she said. \"You must give me your written word that you will\\nnever trouble me again. You must also tell me where I can find my\\nchild, for I see that you have not kept your word about bringing her\\nwith you!\"\\n\\nHe laughed aloud--a harsh, mocking laugh.\\n\\n\"I am not surprised at hearing a remark like that from your lips. A\\nwoman who could abandon her child as easily as _you_ did, without so\\nmuch as knowing its fate, and who is content to live here as Eugene\\nMallard\\'s wife, whenever he is ready to take you to his heart, is\\ncapable of doing anything. I do not wonder that you supposed the little\\none was here in the grounds all night long awaiting your fancy to\\nappear!\"\\n\\nShe recoiled at the words as though he had struck her a blow.\\n\\n\"Let me tell you where your child is,\" he said, hoarsely. \"You shall\\nknow its fate!\"\\n\\nAs he spoke, he seized the hand that held the money, and tore the bills\\nfrom her grasp.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LX.\\n\\n\\nIda sunk on her knees before him.\\n\\n\"Come,\" he said; \"you must go quietly with me.\"\\n\\n\"Inhuman monster!\" moaned Ida.\\n\\n\"Come. This is no time to exchange compliments,\" he said. \"We have\\nparleyed here too long already.\"\\n\\nHis grasp tightened on the slender wrist, but she did not seem to heed\\nthe pain of it.\\n\\n\"I can not, I will not go with you!\" she panted.\\n\\nA taunting laugh answered her. He was dragging her by main force down\\nthe path, when the figure of a man suddenly sprung before him.\\n\\n\"You!\" cried Royal Ainsley, furiously.\\n\\n\"Yes, it is I!\" returned Eugene Mallard, sternly. \"I am just in time,\\nit appears, to save my--this lady from you.\"\\n\\nAt the sight of Eugene, Ida flung up her hands with a wild cry, and\\nsunk at his feet unconscious. Royal Ainsley sprung forward to catch her\\nin his arms, but Eugene dashed up to him.\\n\\n\"Lay one hand on her at your peril!\" he commanded.\\n\\n\"And who shall prevent me, when she is my wife?\" sneered Royal Ainsley.\\n\\n\"She is _not_ your wife!\" cried Eugene Mallard, his face darkening;\\n\"and here and now, I propose to avenge the wrongs you have done her.\\nThere will be a duel to the death between us! I have two pistols in my\\npocket, you shall take one and defend yourself, I will use the other.\"\\n\\nRoyal Ainsley sprung forward. Quick as a flash he drew something from\\nhis vest-pocket. It was a sharp steel dagger which he always carried.\\n\\nHe made a lunge forward, but his foot slipped, and he fell to the earth\\nin mortal pain. The dagger he had intended to plunge into the body of\\nhis cousin had been the cause of his own death.\\n\\nIn an instant Eugene was bending over him.\\n\\n\"It is too late!\" gasped the miserable man--\"it is all over with me\\nnow. I am about to pass in my checks. Don\\'t you think so?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Eugene; \"you are mortally wounded, I can see that. Heaven\\nforgive you for the sins you have committed!\"\\n\\nEugene carried Ida to her own room, thanking Heaven that he had met no\\none. No one would know of her presence in the grounds.\\n\\nThen he quickly summoned the servants.\\n\\nRoyal Ainsley, lying there with his face upturned to the sunlight and\\nhis hand clutching the fatal dagger, told its own story.\\n\\nAs soon as Ida was able to see him Eugene sent for her to come to the\\nlibrary.\\n\\nWhen she received the summons, the poor soul, white as death, fell upon\\nher knees.\\n\\n\"He is going to denounce me for my sin, and for not telling him when I\\nfound it out,\" she said.\\n\\nCould she face him, now that he knew all?\\n\\nAs she knelt there she caught a glimpse of herself in the great mirror\\nopposite.\\n\\nAgain the girl knocked at the door.\\n\\n\"Tell your master that I will see him to-morrow,\" she whispered in a\\nstrained, strange voice; and the girl went away.\\n\\nStrange fancies seemed to throng through her brain.\\n\\nRoyal Ainsley was dead, she had heard them say; and she fancied that\\nher child was dead, too.\\n\\nAnd now the man she loved had sent for her to turn her from the house,\\nand she would never see him again.\\n\\nThen she thought of the brook, so deep, so wide, that struggled on to\\nmeet the sea.\\n\\nYes, she would go there where some of the happiest, ay, and some of\\nthe most sorrowful moments of her life had been spent. The deep waters\\nwould carry her away on their bosom.\\n\\nAt intervals the girl came to the door to inquire if she wanted\\nanything. The answer was always the same--\"No.\"\\n\\nShe never knew how the long hours passed; she was like one in a dream.\\n\\nAt last night came. She waited until the house was dark and still.\\nThere was silence in the hall. All the lights were out, every one was\\nasleep, and the troubles of the day were blotted out.\\n\\nShe raised the long French window that opened out onto the lawn and\\nstepped out into the garden.\\n\\nAs she passed the room in which Eugene Mallard was quietly sleeping,\\nshe knelt and laid her cold white lips on the threshold his feet would\\npress.\\n\\nHow cruelly Heaven had punished her, because in those other days she\\nhad longed to be a lady, like the heroines she had read of in the great\\nworld of beauty and fashion.\\n\\nShe reached the brook and knelt down beside it. The moon threw a\\nsilvery light upon it, and in its song she seemed to hear Eugene\\'s\\nvoice mingled with that of the little child she had lost.\\n\\n\"I am coming to you, little baby!\" she muttered below her breath. Then\\naloud, she said: \"Good-bye, Eugene--good-bye forever!\"\\n\\nSuddenly a pair of strong arms clasped her, and Eugene\\'s voice\\nwhispered:\\n\\n\"Not good-bye, my darling!\"\\n\\nOnly the stars and the moonlight and the rippling waters of the brook\\nheard what he said--how he pleaded with her to live only for him and\\nher little child.\\n\\nIda could not believe the great happiness that had suddenly fallen upon\\nher like a mantle from God\\'s hands.\\n\\nThey talked by the brook-side for long hours. The next day the master\\nand mistress of the great mansion went away.\\n\\nWhen they reached New York, another ceremony was performed, which made\\nIda Eugene Mallard\\'s wife until death should part them.\\n\\nThen they quietly went and obtained the little child, whom both\\nidolized, and went abroad, where they remained for years.\\n\\nNo one learned the strange romance of the fair young girl whom Eugene\\nMallard worshipped so fondly.\\n\\nWhen they returned to their home, years after, with a lovely, dark-eyed\\nlittle girl and a sturdy, blue-eyed boy, no one guessed but that they\\nwere Eugene Mallard\\'s children.\\n\\nWhile they had been abroad they read of the marriage of Hildegarde\\nCramer to Philip Ravenswood, the noble young man who had loved her ever\\nsince they had first met on the Newport sands.\\n\\nThe same paper also brought the intelligence of the engagement of\\nArthur Hollis and pretty Dora Staples, and the sad ending, in a\\nrailroad accident, of beautiful, hapless Vivian Deane and her maid Nora.\\n\\nEugene passed the paper to his wife, and Ida read it, making no\\ncomments. But after awhile, as though the subject weighed heavily on\\nher mind, she went up to Eugene, and laid her soft white arms round his\\nneck, and whispered:\\n\\n\"Does the knowledge of Hildegarde\\'s marriage bring you any regrets,\\nEugene?\"\\n\\n\"No, my darling!\" he cried, clasping her in his strong arms. \"For all\\nthe love of my heart is yours now, and--and--our children\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"I have often wanted to ask you, Eugene,\" she murmured, with her face\\nhidden on his breast, \"if the story of my past were known, how would\\npeople judge me? Would the world say, \\'Ida May had sinned\\'?\"\\n\\nLet us hope all our readers will join heartily in his answer--\"No.\"\\n\\n\\nTHE END.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  THE A. and L.
