The commander of the ship is a brutal man by the name of Maurice Frere. With the Vickers is a young girl, Sarah Purfoy, as a nurse to the child. However, she really is the fiancée of John Rex, convicted for forgery, and tries to help the convicts take the ship. The rebellion is led by a murderer named Gabbett.

The night market was planned to run from May 21 until October 11, operating Friday, Saturday, Sunday and holiday evenings. Target Entertainment Inc. had formed a partnership with Starlight Casino for the event. The planned area offered 1000 free parking spots. It was expected the night market would draw around 10,000 visitors per week and two million over the course of the year, said Darren Harding, executive general manager of the casino.

An example of the problem was Stephen Jerome, a puritanical preacher, who in 1625 nonetheless tried to rape one of his maidservants, Margaret Knowsley. Rumours of this spread across the town, eventually leading to Knowsley's imprisonment and public shaming in 1627. A few years later, Jerome went to Ireland to continue his preaching career.Steve Hindle, \"The shaming of Margaret Knowsley: gossip, gender and the experience of authority in early modern England\", Continuity and Change 9 (1994), pp. 391–419.\\n   \n",

\"We are in Baltimore, Lamar.\" \"Baltimore, Maryland.\" \"That's the second crib of mine them motherfuckers cracked this week.\" \"Stir up a hornet's nest, no telling who gonna get stung.\" \" All paranoid and shit.\" \" Gotta be.\" \"They got Latroy.\" \"Hey, what the fuck is y'all on the streets for, man?\" \"Don't y'all know there's a fucking war going on, man?\" \"Get the fuck in the truck, man.\" \"What happened to all them towers?\" \"Slow train coming.\" \"Reform, Lamar.\" \"Reform.\" \"We should be up on this shit, hearing voices.\" \"We get a signature number on Bodie's phone, we will be.\" \"We got enough PC off the burners alone.\" \"Every time these fucking pen registers click out a call... it screams drug conspiracy.\" \"I'm not the one taking the case to court.\" \"Pearlman wants a specific link to a known drug trafficker.\" \"These drug crews, they're dumping phones every couple of weeks at best.\" \"So when we do get a wire up, it's gonna be a limited run.\" \"And dumping phones doesn't meet... the cellular company's definition of \"exigent circumstance,\" right?\" \"What's your boss willing to do?\" \"Demper?\" \"He's a bit too focused on next year's re-election fight.\" \"How about the feds?\" \"They say they can't do anything for us.\" \"And if you look at how they use the Federal Communications Act... they're not lying.\" \"For national security stuff, they use the Patriot Act.\" \"Everything else gets shorted.\" \"The fact is, the industry has all of us by the balls.\" \"Pardon my French, Your Honor.\" \"All right, I'll tell you what.\" \"Best I can do for you is this.\" \"You give me a boilerplate affidavit with the PC from the court report.\" \"And then, as you get fresh numbers for the new disposables, you call me... anytime, day or night, to jump phones.\" \"That helps.\" \"But we're still gonna be getting up on their phones...\" \" even as they're coming down.\" \" Yeah, probably so.\" \" This is so totally...\" \" Fucked up.\" \"Judge Phelan has you on his mind.\" \"How long has that been going on?\" \"Started with my first jury trial in his court, I think.\" \"I bet you won all your motions.\" \" You wanted to see me, sir?\" \" Have a seat.\" \"I wanna thank you for the loyalty you showed... moving that body.\" \"It wasn't the most sensible thing, but I appreciate it, nonetheless.\" \"You're a good man, Sergeant.\" \"You got good instincts... and as far as I can tell, you're a decent supervisor.\" \"But from where I sit... you ain't shit when it come to policing.\" \"Don't take it personal.\" \"Ain't just you, it's all our young police... whole generation of y'all.\" \"No, you think about it.\" \"You've been here over a year now, Carver.\" \"You got nobody looking out for you, nobody willing to talk to you.\" \"That about sum it up?\" \"Now, that's a problem.\" \"And I didn't think there was any way I was ever gonna get my head around it... but then Dozerman gets shot for some bullshit.\" \"And that's when I about reach my limit.\" \"And that's when the idea of the free zone, of Hamsterdam, come to me... because this drug thing, this ain't police work.\" \"No, it ain't.\" \"I mean, I can send any fool with a badge and a gun up on them corners... and jack a crew and grab vials.\" \"But policing?\" \"I mean, you call something a war... and pretty soon everybody gonna be running around acting like warriors.\" \"They gonna be running around on a damn crusade... storming corners, slapping on cuffs, racking up body counts.\" \"And when you at war, you need a fucking enemy.\" \"And pretty soon, damn near everybody on every corner is your fucking enemy.\" \"And soon the neighborhood that you're supposed to be policing... that's just occupied territory.\" \"You follow this?\" \"I think so.\" \"Look here, the point I'm making, Carver, is this.\" \"Soldiering and policing, they ain't the same thing.\" \"And before we went and took the wrong turn... and started up with these war games... the cop walked a beat, and he learned that post.\" \"And if there were things that happened up on that post... whether they be a rape or robbery or shooting... he had people out there helping him, feeding him information.\" \"But every time I come to you, my DEU Sergeant... for information, to find out what's going on out there in them streets... all that came back was some bullshit.\" \"You had your stats, you had your arrests, you had your seizures.\" \"But don't none of that amount to shit... when you talking about protecting the neighborhood, now, do it?\" \"You know the worst thing about this so-called drug war... to my mind... it just...\" \"It ruined this job.\" \"Major.\" \" What you got?\" \" Incoming.\" \"A Sun paper reporter.\" \"Been to the free zones, all three of them.\" \"Meet you at the car.\" \"I was thinking, maybe we rewrite the affidavit... add some of the stuff we're getting from the pen registers... build the case that way, take it to the judge.\" \"You have a law degree?\" \"If you did, it would be your call to make.\" \"Who would pretend to be a lawyer that wasn't?\" \"I'm just saying, I think we're being too cautious on this.\" \"We're going the extra mile for Phelan.\" \"A shortcut now could cost us later in motions hearings.\" \"We drew Phelan on this wiretap?\" \"That two-faced hack sold me out, the last go-round.\" \"Relax, he's not running for a new term.\" \"He'll be fine.\" \"Yeah, he's a piece of shit.\" \"We're all pieces of shit when we're in your way.\" \"That goes with the territory.\" \"Point taken.\" \"So it's these warehouses, the old Winchester Homes... and the dead blocks down by Vincent Street?\" \"All three.\" \"And they're just supposed to let it go on like this?\" \"Colvin told us to push the street dealing in these areas... and then we would start locking people up.\" \"But so far, not a single fucking arrest.\" \"And they know about this downtown?\" \"I don't think they have a fucking clue about it.\" \"But I'd love to be there when you pop the question.\" \"This is just...\" \"Tell me about it.\" \" Got the place looking good.\" \" Yeah.\" \"Now all that needs doing is to go out and get you some kids.\" \"Come on, man.\" \"You making it sound easy... but, tell you the truth...\" \"I ain't got no idea how to go at these hoppers.\" \"Oh, I wouldn't lose any sleep over that.\" \"Nobody else does, neither.\" \"We got one.\" \"His grandmother.\" \" Looking for me?\" \" Look, boy... there's no reason to leave your clothes in the washer.\" \"How many damn times do I have to tell you?\" \"Dag, Mee-maw.\" \"I'm sorry.\" \"I just forgot, okay?\" \"But I did pick up the laundry soap.\" \"I picked it up.\" \"Laundry soap, that's definitely a code.\" \"Now let's listen to an intercept we made of Bodie Broadus... when we were up on those payphones a couple of years back.\" \"Look, I'm telling y'all, I saw the boy.\" \"He saying he ain't got that thing.\" \" Same voice, no question.\" \" I'll let the judge know.\" \"Reference the voice comparison in the court report.\" \"We're up.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Got it right here, yo.\" \"Yeah, that's right.\" \" Major Colvin, Western District.\" \" Banisky, Sun papers.\" \"So, this your idea?\" \"Got one, get one.\" \"Mind if we walk?\" \"Apocalypse.\" \"Apocalypse.\" \"Got that Apocalypse.\" \"Right here, shorty.\" \"You got dealers selling with impunity... addicts shooting up on the street... people down here doing outreach, giving out needles and all.\" \"I mean, who knows about this down at headquarters?\" \"Look, Command is well aware of the situation.\" \"While there was some initial concern...\" \"But they feel that the cases we're gonna bring in...\" \" Cases?\" \" Yeah, prosecutions, sure.\" \"Your officers say no one's being locked up in the free zones.\" \"Look, my troops are only involved in pushing the trafficking... to designated areas.\" \"I mean, they're completely ignorant of the investigative aspect.\" \"That's run out of CID downtown.\" \"Yeah?\" \"Who's the lead detective?\" \"Look.\" \"I already said more than I should.\" \"The bottom line is, you start throwing calls around right now... they're gonna shit blue, thinking there's a leak.\" \"They're gonna come up on the case early, and we won't get all we can... out of this good work we did down here.\" \"You're telling me all this is an enforcement strategy?\" \"What the hell else could it be?\" \"I mean, you think we would actually let this happen otherwise?\" \"Come on, Banisky.\" \"I mean, look.\" \"Look at this mess.\" \"Any other reporter gets on it...\" \"I give it to you, and you run with it right then.\" \"Absolutely.\" \"A week.\" \"But then I gotta run something, no matter what.\" \" Purple Haze, Purple Haze.\" \" It's understood.\" \"Right there.\" \"So, brother, what brought you back?\" \"It disturbs me to leave business unfinished.\" \"Heard you was shot before you even got started down here.\" \"Not like you to get played.\" \"Betrayed, you mean.\" \"I am looking for the man they sent.\" \"From his accent, he's homegrown, raised on the street.\" \"Skilled, intelligent, late 20s, dark... but with a scar across his face, like so.\" \" You down with this nigga?\" \" I know him.\" \"Not to speak to... but you can't be anywhere near the game and not know the motherfucker.\" \" He with Barksdale?\" \" He with himself.\" \"Except for when he running with a young boy or two.\" \"Ten months to the primary, and you right now should be all about money.\" \"I know, I know.\" \"Dialing for dollars.\" \"You start this week, and you don't stop until you hit your numbers.\" \"We're gonna need $1 million just for television.\" \"Do you really think this is doable?\" \"The odds aren't great, but, yeah.\" \"I think it can be done... as long as the thousand things that can go wrong, don't go wrong.\" \"Even for a white guy?\" \"Even for a white guy.\" \"Speaking of which...\" \"I notice a certain monochromatic effect here.\" \"One thing we're gonna need is black faces... and we're gonna need them in prominent positions.\" \"You're right.\" \"You gotta start thinking about endorsement by black leaders.\" \"Ministers, community people, elected officials.\" \"Here comes the hard part.\" \"Splitting the black vote is the only way to make the math work.\" \"So, Tony Gray's gotta get in the race.\" \"He's gotta stay in the race, and he's gotta stay viable in the race.\" \"Guy's kind of a lightweight, ain't he?\" \" He's a good guy, all in all.\" \" Great.\" \"He's a good guy, but we need him to siphon votes from Royce.\" \"I don't know.\" \"This thing with Tony...\" \"It's not personal, Tommy.\" \"It's politics.\" \"Live with it, or lose.\" \"Yo, yo.\" \"That boy with the sharp nose, he going, you know...\" \" He going to the Apollo.\" \" The Apollo?\" \"Yeah.\" \"He gonna need two tickets.\" \"Damn.\" \"Tweety Bird working that shit.\" \"Motherfucker, how many times I gotta tell you not to use no names?\" \" Oh, yeah, right.\" \"So I holler at you?\" \" Yeah.\" \"All right.\" \" Apollo, like the theater?\" \" Like 125th Street.\" \"125 grams, one-eighth of a kilo.\" \"Two tickets means \"twice that. \"\" \" The only new code so far is Hamsterdam.\" \" Hamsterdam?\" \"We're thinking it might have something to do with the stash house.\" \"Well, I'm gonna hook up with Kima, catch the Tweety Bird meet.\" \"You're happy with what we're getting?\" \"Another week of calls like this... and we'll have their network fleshed out and plenty more phones to go up on.\" \"I need a moment with the detectives.\" \"Sure.\" \"IID picked up Prez's shooting.\" \"It's to be expected.\" \"The racial thing alone is tense enough that they gotta react.\" \"No luck at all to that boy, huh?\" \"For the supervisor's report...\" \"I need to ask if either of you had any indication... that Prez harbored racial prejudices.\" \"Well, he harbored some weird shit, no doubt, but I never got a racial vibe.\" \"Lieutenant, you seriously asking?\" \"Not to start no shit, but you think Waggoner gets shot if he's white?\" \" Description called for a number one male.\" \" I'm just saying.\" \"The good Lord set Sunday morning aside for churchgoing.\" \"Even Kenny Bird and Peanut, when they was warring... had the good sense to respect the truce.\" \"You know them Barksdales sent a hat?\" \"A church crown?\" \"Walked up, rang the bell, and set it down on the porch.\" \"'Cause they ashamed.\" \"Is Miss Josephine mending?\" \"She bruised up still, but she all right, though.\" \"But you ain't.\" \"Not until I settle this for good.\" \"Hey, yo, Butch, I want you to go inside my bank and spread the word.\" \"Omar paying cash money to get at them people, you feel me?\" \"Hey, save your money.\" \" Come on now, Butchie, I got to do this, yo.\" \" I'm saying you ain't got to pay.\" \"Thomkins, up on McCulloh.\" \"What, the funeral home?\" \"You mean to tell me all this time you had a scope on them clowns...\" \" and you ain't let loose a mumbling word.\" \" Caught myself looking out for you.\" \"Fact of the matter is, your chances of going up against that mob... and coming back is as slim as a garter snake.\" \"I can't help that now, Butch.\" \"What the fuck?\" \"Where's my people?\" \"Slim Charles pulled them.\" \"Hired new muscle.\" \"Slim Charles?\" \"When the fuck did he...\" \"How's the count?\" \"Down bad for the third straight week.\" \"And the shelf-life of the shit we got, it ain't gonna last, String.\" \"I know.\" \"Slim said they're to stick to you for protection.\" \" Give it here.\" \"Give it here.\" \" Nice shot.\" \"Dribble it back out.\" \"Dribble it back out.\" \"Get your dribble on.\" \"Fucking hack.\" \"Yo, yo, easy, easy.\" \"Y'all just hacking my man up.\" \"Foul machine.\" \"Nice drive.\" \"Kind of unschooled, ain't they?\" \"What the fuck you cherry-picking for?\" \"That observation meant as just a casual curbside, \"Fuck you\"... or are you looking to step up, maybe help out here?\" \"I'm gonna give it a try.\" \"I'm looking to get some kids interested in boxing.\" \"Boxing?\" \"Look here.\" \"This is my time-out corner.\" \"Where I send children who can't play nice together.\" \"Listen up.\" \"This man's starting a boxing program.\" \"And from the looks of some of y'all, signing on might be a good thing.\" \"You gonna need it.\" \"The only thing he know how to do with his fist is wrap it around his cock.\" \"Fuck you, man!\" \"Gonna kick your ass!\" \"Come on, motherfucker, you ain't shit.\" \"Ease up.\" \"Sit down, sit down.\" \"Sit down.\" \"Come on, man.\" \"Sit down, man.\" \"Sit down.\" \"My man, you dropping your right.\" \"See, if young'un there was trained, he'd whip you.\" \"Look like he the one that got beat.\" \"Stand up, let me show you something.\" \"Come on, man.\" \"I ain't gonna hurt you.\" \"Yellow tops, yellow tops, got them yellow tops.\" \"Yellow tops.\" \"See that?\" \"All right, sit down.\" \"Look, if y'all wanna learn more...\" \"I got a gym down on Gilmor in the old tire plant.\" \"Y'all are all welcome.\" \"All right?\" \"I saw Tweety Bird parked up there.\" \"All we gotta do is wait for the re-up.\" \"I hope these fucks don't dick around and make us sit here all day.\" \"What, this is eating at you?\" \"No, I'm good.\" \"Yeah, I can see that.\" \"Remember that woman I was talking about?\" \"Politician woman?\" \"How's it going?\" \"It ain't.\" \"Turned to shit.\" \"Feel like I don't even belong to any world that even fucking matters.\" \"'Cause you're a cop?\" \"Nah, it's not just that.\" \"It's like, I went to meet her once.\" \"She was in a hotel room, the top floor.\" \"I punched the button on the elevator.\" \"It doesn't even go there, 'cause you have to have some fucking special key... to even get to that special fucking floor.\" \"So I go to the front desk, some sneering fuck calls upstairs... to give me permission to go get laid.\" \"I listen to the shit she talks about... first time in my life, I feel like a fucking doormat.\" \"Like anyone with any smarts would do something else with his life, you know?\" \"Earn money or get elected.\" \"Like I'm just a breathing machine for my fucking dick.\" \"I'm serious.\" \"I'm the smartest asshole in three districts... and she looks at me like I'm some stupid fuck... playing some stupid game for stupid penny-ante stakes.\" \"She fucking looks through me, Kima.\" \"Yo, stay in the car, man.\" \"Tall man said to stick to you like...\" \"Tall man gonna be there when I stomp on your fucking head?\" \"Stay in the car.\" \"Yo, make it short, man, I got a meet to make.\" \"Oh, fuck the meet!\" \"You harder to get at than my fat wife's cunt, nigga.\" \"Yeah, you high-and-mighty Barksdales can afford to sit back and play low-key.\" \"But some of us gotta work for a goddamn living.\" \"What, you think this mess ain't fucking up our business?\" \"That means Avon's willing to sit down and talk with Marlo, work this shit out?\" \"Well, if that don't happen, String, I got you some bad news.\" \"Me and the boys had us a sit-down.\" \"Got a quorum and took a vote that says... if y'all don't quit this war, we have a mind to shut you out.\" \"And when I say out, String, I mean out the package.\" \"The boys don't wanna extend the good shit... if it's gonna keep you and your peoples out on them corners, banging.\" \"What about the boy?\" \"What the fuck he say?\" \"Vinson say Marlo willing to talk if he can keep his corners.\" \"Now hear me on this, String, we ain't no ingrates.\" \"We all recognize your contribute to the co-op.\" \"But the feeling is this.\" \"It ain't right for you to be at the head of our table when you can't call off your dog.\" \"Call it a crisis of leadership.\" \"You're gonna tell them?\" \"Got to.\" \"Between the health-care workers, the reporter, and my own pissed-off troops... it's gonna come out.\" \"Either tomorrow or the next day.\" \"We should make a few arrests, make it look tactical.\" \"Nah.\" \"You know what happens if we start locking people up in Hamsterdam?\" \"The whole rest of the district goes back to being a shithole.\" \"Nah.\" \"If Rawls is gonna hand me my ass... at least give me a chance to tell the man my story first.\" \"Devonne.\" \"What was that?\" \"It needed doing.\" \"Somebody just got shot!\" \"What you want I should give the snitch that clued us to the Denali.\" \"I mean, we didn't get Marlo, but still...\" \"No, he kept his end up.\" \"Go it all.\" \"Avon, I need a word, man.\" \"Let me holler at you.\" \"Get them niggas out of here, man.\" \"Check it out, String.\" \"This shit got the kill range of, like, 50 meters.\" \"Slim got this from some soldier coming back from wherever.\" \"You know, I spoke to Prop Joe's people.\" \" They think we can work this out.\" \" A sit-down?\" \"It's the perfect time for it, man.\" \"I mean... you done represented yourself, man.\" \"Your name ringing out... now that you done taken Marlo down a notch or two, man.\" \"So why not quit while we's ahead?\" \"Just let me get this thing right, man.\" \"Then, you know, we get back to business as usual.\" \"They gonna cut us out, Avon!\" \"Prop Joe and them niggas, man, they took a vote.\" \"They gonna cut us out.\" \"We ain't gonna have that dope, so even if we win, we lose... 'cause we ain't gonna have no product to put on them fucking corners, B.\" \"Avon, look at you.\" \"Fucking shooting dope without a fucking needle right now, man... getting high on a power trip, playing fucking soldier.\" \"Yo, you gotta sit back, man, and think about our business.\" \"What the fuck you want?\" \"That motherfucker.\" \"He good.\" \"What happened?\" \"You know, Avon, you gotta think about what we got in this game for, man.\" \"Was it the rep?\" \"Was it so our names could ring out on some fucking ghetto street corners, man?\" \"Nah, man, there's games beyond the fucking game.\" \"Avon, look, you and me, we brothers, B.\" \"We didn't think we'll make it this fucking far, but fuck if we ain't standing here... right now, with the whole world at our feet.\" \"The whole world, man, not these fucking corners.\" \"The whole world, B.\" \"You know what Slim just told me?\" \"Devonne come up dead.\" \"She was shot, one in the mouth, one in each tit.\" \"You still wanna talk truce, String?\" \"You right when you say I need to learn more discipline.\" \"But this?\" \"You could do this better.\" \"You're the perfect bait, Lamar.\" \"They'll see you as conflicted.\" \"Your homophobia is so visceral.\" \"You see that?\" \"I ain't even stepped inside the joint yet, and you calling me a cocksucker already.\" \"You in the right place?\" \"I'm looking for someone named Omar.\" \"No last name.\" \"Scar across his face and shit.\" \"Scarface named Omar?\" \"Sounds different, but I can't help you.\" \"You drinking?\" \"Maybe you wait four years.\" \"No.\" \"It has to be now.\" \"It's gotta be a three-way, and Tony's gonna go this time.\" \"I'm just...\" \"Tony's my oldest friend on the Council.\" \"Well, couldn't you go talk to him first?\" \"Put it on the table?\" \"You know, \"May the best man win\"?\" \"Truth is... he can't win alone against Royce, either.\" \"He's got the bumper stickers, but not much else.\" \"Wants to run on education.\" \"I mean... where do you go with that?\" \"If I level with Tony and he gets out, then I can't win.\" \"I need him in the race.\" \"I feel like shit.\" \"I really do.\" \"Don't look like much.\" \" This don't look like shit.\" \" Hell, yeah.\" \" This some weak-ass shit right here.\" \" Hell, yeah.\" \"Man, we got lockers, got gear.\" \" It's all peeling and shit.\" \" Go long.\" \"Hey, hey, hey, pass it here.\" \" You getting me all dirty and shit.\" \" Hey, fuck your jeans.\" \" Fuck you.\" \" Bitch.\" \"We clocked the meet with Tweety Bird, stayed on him overnight... tracked him to a possible stash house... and then home to nest in Woodlawn.\" \"Got photos, his tags...\" \" What happened?\" \" They ditched their phones.\" \"The DNRs and the wire all died around 3:00.\" \"We were online just shy of 30 hours.\" \"I thought we had them on their burners for a couple of weeks.\" \"Not anymore.\" \"It's a week at best.\" \"We just spent $9,000 and change for 18 intercepts... five of them non-pertinent.\" \"That's close to $700 per drug call.\" \"Until we see which way this goes... shouldn't we get back on Bernard and his girl?\" \"I mean, get a line on the new phones at least.\" \"But that'll only give us what we just had, 30 hours.\" \"Any way to get ourselves ahead of the curve?\" \"If there were some way to pre-wiretap the burners...\" \"And what then?\" \"Stick them on a rack at Baba-whatever and wait for Bernard to show up that day?\" \"The problem is the wireless people.\" \"They claim it takes a minimum of four days to process a court order... and that's only after I had my office threaten to go public on them.\" \"Four days to hit a couple of keystrokes.\" \"Bullshit.\" \"Well, what if...\" \"No way.\" \"I know what you're thinking.\" \"I just thought the same fucking thing.\" \"All right, look, man.\" \"When I tell you, put your left foot out, boy.\" \" Hey, Unc patting my man's feet.\" \" Yeah, he smelling up my ass, too.\" \"Stop with the damn clowning, man.\" \"How the fuck you gonna learn something, acting like a damn fool?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Ain't no big mystery why your face got tattooed.\" \"Shit, that man can't talk to you like that.\" \"I seen his raggedy ass up at the spot, copping vials.\" \"Yeah, probably pimps his ass, too.\" \" Listen, motherfucker...\" \" Yeah, bitch, touch me.\" \"Touch a juvenile, see what happen.\" \"Let's bounce.\" \"Bitch-ass motherfucker.\" \"Faggot.\" \" Punk-ass nigga.\" \" Chump ass.\" \"Lester.\" \"First time I seen him smoking.\" \"Tough habit.\" \"And pacing like a motherfuck, too.\" \"Heavy is the head that wears the crown.\" \"Bay Wireless Connect 411.\" \"What city and state?\" \"Baltimore, Maryland.\" \" How may I help you?\" \" Baltimore police.\" \" Any particular department?\" \" Western District police.\" \" Is this an emergency?\" \" No.\" \"Non-emergency.\" \"Man, they did you with the bum rush.\" \"That's what they do.\" \"They past experts at plucking nerves.\" \"You just gotta remember they barely housebroke.\" \"I'm telling you, man, you wouldn't believe it.\" \"They was all wild and shit.\" \"Wouldn't listen.\" \"Andre, I want you to crowd him.\" \" Yes, sir, I'll crowd him.\" \" All right.\" \"Time!\" \"You just gotta set your mind to stick with it.\" \"When those two stumbled in here, they was wild as wild.\" \"Now they come in every day.\" \"\"Yes, sir.\" \"No, sir. \"\" \"Still pretty rough but, you know, with the right breaks, they gonna make it.\" \"How?\" \"Well, try as they might, I won't let them fail.\" \"When you do that,

      "In a previous paper(*) we discussed in detail the pharmacological action and therapeutic properties of emetine, and pointed out that it was a potent drug and that its dosage and the length of time during which it was given should be most carefully considered. Unfortunately this point does not appear to be fully appreciated by many practitioners, and it is not uncommon to come across cases who have had 20 or more infections. Untoward effects resulting from the abuse of the drug have been put down to the disease for which the drug is given, though Dale's experiments on rabbits and cats (2) definitely proved that such was not the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emetine is a geueial protoplasmic poison and, in all probability, has a selective action 011 certain specialised forms of protoplasm occurring in the cells of the different organs in the body. To determine the particular susceptibility of certain important organs to this drug we carried out a series of experiments on rabbits. We selected strong and healthy adult animals which were weighed and were kept under the best possible conditions. The dosage given by Dale, i.e., 1 mgm. for each kilo body weight, worked out on the basis of one and a half grains for an average man of 65 kilos, was followed by us. The injections were given daily intramuscularly, alternately into each thigh and under perfect aseptic conditions ; the animals were very carefully watched. The concentration of the solution injected was the same as is used clinically.\n",
      "\n",
      "These animals were examined after the 6th, 8tb, 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th injections and careful notes of the naked eye post-mortem conditions of the different organs of the body were made, special attention being paid to the heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, supra-renals, stomach and intestines. Pieces of these viscera were removed and preserved in Zenker's fluid, and subsequently Major H. W. Acton, i.m.s., Professor of Pathology at the School, very kindly cut sections of them, stained and examined them. The attached table gives in detail the macroscopic and microscopic changes which occurred. General Symptoms.?In this series the toxic symptoms made their appearance after 6 injections were given, became more marked as the number of injections was increased and some of the animals died after the 10th injection. Weakness and general depression were the first effects noticed and the animals lost appetite. These were followed by diarrhoea, lethargy and emaciation, which became more and more marked with the increasing number of injections and finally they all died. Naked Eye Post-mortem Changes.?Locally at the site of injection extensve oedema of the subcutaneous tissues, involving the whole group of the thigh muscles was a marked feature. Small capillary haemorrhages, sometimes coalescing and forming a big patch, occurred generally in the substance of the muscles. These were due to the toxic effects of emetine 011 the endothelium of the capillaries and were not noticed with tartar emetic or with the cinchona alkaloids. Another feature which is common with the latter drugs and which was not present in the case of emetine was the entire absence of necrosis of the tissues around the site of injection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Visceral Changes.?The mucous membrane of the stomach and of the intestines became somewhat congested and inflamed after 6 or 7 injections and this became more marked as more injections were given. These effects are due to the irritant action of the drug, as it is excreted through the mucous membrane, and are, no doubt, the cause of the diarrhtea which occurs during emetine injections. Later petechial hemorrhages were also observed. The liver was found somewhat shrunken in the early stages, but later showed signs of congestion and still later had a mottled appearance and was lighter in colour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Microscopical examination showed engorgement of the portal capillaries and fatty infiltration especially marked at the periphery of the lobules. The gallbladder was always found to be distended, and there was plenty of bile in the intestine,, shewing that the secretion of bile was somewhat stimulated. The pancreas showed no changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the kidneys changes made their appearance later, i.e., after 9 to 10 injections. Microscopic examination of the organ at this stage shewed engorgement of the capillaries, and later cloudy swelling of the epithelial cells of the tubules and fatty infiltration became evident. The suprarenals were somewhat soft, but no microscopical changes could be detected in them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lungs.?In this series the lungs did not show any noticeable changes till after 8 or 9 injections. Then there were signs of congestion and some animals had small petechial haemorrhages on the surface. Microscopical examination did not reveal any other change except engorgement of the capillaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Heart.?The heart was affected very early. After 6 to 7 injections there were signs of engorgement. of the right side and the organ became flabby and later became atrophied. Microscopical examination shewed extensive changes in the muscle fibres. The first change to be observed was cloudy swelling of the cells and the transverse striation became less distinct. Later the striation disappeared and the fibres shrunk and atrophied, and young connective tissue cells took their place. These fibrillary changes were more marked in some of our animals than in others.\n",
      "\n",
      "We did not notice any changes of the nature of brown atrophy in the fibres. These changes in the parenchyma of the heart, which set in quite early, are probably the cause of the clinical symptoms which make their appearance quite early in some patients after emetine injections. The depression of the heart and acceleration of the pulse are noticed after a few injections, followed by alterations in the excitability and conductivity of the muscle fibres of the heart, auricular and [July, 1924. emetine indiscriminately. Arrillaga and Guglielmetti(3) have shewn by experiments on the heart of frogs and dogs that emetine hydrochloride is a strong cardiac poison and that moderate doses produce auriculo-ventricular dissociation and death from auricular fibrillation. We have confirmed this on the intact and isolated hearts of cats and rabbits. Small doses of 1 to 2 mgms. here produced a marked depreciation and stoppage of the heart. Bais(4) has recorded a case of poisoning in a Javanese woman where 1.080 mgm. (16.6 grains) divided into three series of 6  best in an alkaline substrate, but in amoebic dysentery the stools are acid.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the reaction of the gut could be altered towards alkalinity, not only would the conditions be unfavourable for the organism, but emetine would also be more effective.\n",
      "\n",
      "Henry and Brown(6) have shewn that attempts to markedly alter the pH of the gut contents by giving large doses of alkalies ?as with Sinton's mixture?are not successful.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only drugs which did appear to make any difference were large doses of magnesium carbonate, bismuth carbonate and sodium bicarbonate in combination. Acton and Chopra (unpublished) made a series of observations by introducing large quantities of alkaline salts directly into the alimentary canal of cats and found that the only compounds which altered the acidity of the gut to any extent were bismuth salts, and their action was in all probability due to their fixing the free acids of the gut and to their comparatively long sojourn in its lumen. 1 he routine method of treatment of cases of amoebic dysentery nowadopted at the Carmichael Hospital for Tropical Diseases is to give 6 injections daily of one grain of emetine hydrochloride combined with 2 to 3 drachms of bismuth subnitrate or carbonate by the mouth three times a day, a saline purgative having been previously given. The patient is then given rest for three days and three more injections are given. This method has proved very satisfactory in the treatment of cases of amoebic dysentery arid it is hardly ever necessary to give a larger number of injections.\n",

      "Conclusions.\n",
      "\n",
      "(1) Emetine is a general protoplasmic poison having a selective action on the cells of certain organs in the rabbit, (2) The parenchyma of the heart muscle is one of the earliest to be affected, the changes being (a) cloudy swelling of the muscle fibres and disappearance of transverse striatiou; (b) shrinking of the muscle fibres; (c) atrophy of fibres and their replacement by connective tissue cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "These may be the cause of some of the cardiac symptoms which occur in the course of injections in patients. (3) The presence of petechial hemorrhage at the site of injection and in other organs shews that emetine has a selective action on the endothelium of the capillaries. (4) The liver and kidneys are also affected later, the changes being chiefly congestion and fatty infiltration of the parenchyma. (5) A smaller number of injections are required to cure the disease it these are combined with large doses of bismuth subnitrate or carbonate by the mouth.\n",

I think they should write down information in invisible ink, for all the changes that come along.  I'm also repacking all my gear according to the packing list I received from the company. It's gonna be tough getting all my stuff into duffel bags according to the list, so I'm planning on getting one of my storage bins to put extra stuff in. Tomorrow is the barbecue, so most of my family should be here. I doubt if I'll have a chance to post for a few days, but hopefully I'll be able to write something down early next week.     \n",

      "The present volume is devoted to a further installment of Aduarte's\n",
      "Historia, begun in Vol. XXX--which work will be completed in our\n",
      "next issue. The part here given covers the years 1596 to 1608 in the\n",
      "history of the Dominican order in the Philippines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Resuming Aduarte's account of the missions carried on by his order\n",
      "among the Indians of Cagayan, in northern Luzon, the pious and\n",
      "devout acts of their converts, and the joy and gratitude of the\n",
      "religious thereat, are recounted at length. In 1596, news comes to\n",
      "the islands of the death of Bishop Salazar in Spain. Aduarte describes\n",
      "in detail the life, achievements, and virtues of that prelate. He was\n",
      "distinguished--not only in the Philippines, but during a long residence\n",
      "in Nueva Espana--as the friend and protector of the Indian natives. His\n",
      "mode of life was most simple and austere; he was charitable and\n",
      "generous to the full extent of his limited means. By nature choleric\n",
      "and quick-tempered, he trained himself to patience and forbearance;\n",
      "and the slanders of the evil-minded against him only roused his\n",
      "compassion. He was public-spirited, and foremost in all enterprises\n",
      "for the good of the community. To him are attributed the royal grant\n",
      "to the Jesuits for maintaining a school, and the establishment and\n",
      "much of the endowment of the hospital for sick Indians.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bishop Salazar's journey to Spain enables him to secure for\n",
      "his cathedral important aid, and the division of his diocese,\n",
      "so that its manifold duties may be more satisfactorily performed;\n",
      "soon afterward, he dies at Madrid. During his absence, his see is\n",
      "directed by his vicar-general, Fray Christobal de Salvatierra, to\n",
      "an account of whose exemplary life, valuable labors, and apostolic\n",
      "virtues a chapter is devoted. He protects the Indians, and does much\n",
      "to reform the morals of the Spaniards. Among other things, he compels\n",
      "the Chinese to cease such of their theatrical performances as contain\n",
      "idolatrous and superstitious matter; and obliges the Spaniards to give\n",
      "up attendance at these comedies. It is he who begins the spiritual\n",
      "conquest of the Cagayan region, and he goes on other expeditions;\n",
      "and he assumes charge of the Bataan mission until missionaries come\n",
      "for that field. At his death, he appoints two Dominicans to assume his\n",
      "duties as vicar-general; but they are so opposed by the ecclesiastical\n",
      "cabildo that they resign the office to the latter. Next comes a\n",
      "biographical sketch of the younger Juan de Castro, who is assigned\n",
      "to the toilsome and difficult mission of Pangasinan. In December,\n",
      "1593, he accompanies an embassy to China; on the return voyage, the\n",
      "ship is wrecked. Castro escapes to land, but soon afterward dies as\n",
      "a result of the shock and exposure thus suffered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aduarte recounts, with much detail, the expedition of 1596 to Cambodia,\n",
      "which is accompanied by himself and another Dominican, Fray Alonso\n",
      "Ximenez. Velloso's junk is driven ashore by a storm, and the men, after\n",
      "much privation and suffering, make it over into a shallow oared vessel,\n",
      "and row along the coast in search of water and inhabited places. When\n",
      "reduced to the last extremity, they accidentally find fresh water,\n",
      "and thus are saved, finally making their way to a fort where some\n",
      "Cambojan soldiers are stationed. From these the Spaniards learn that\n",
      "the king who was friendly to them has been driven out by a usurper,\n",
      "and that one of their consorts in the Spanish fleet has reached that\n",
      "country. They join this ship, and soon afterward, learning that the\n",
      "king is plotting to destroy them all, and coming to blows with the\n",
      "Chinese traders who have come to Chordemuco, the Spaniards attack\n",
      "the Cambojans at night and defeat them, killing the usurper of that\n",
      "throne. The Spanish commander Gallinato arrives, and decides to\n",
      "return to Manila; but contrary winds force them to land at Malaca,\n",
      "after twice encountering enemies. Nearly a year later, they succeed\n",
      "in reaching Manila, without other result of their journey \"but that\n",
      "of having suffered for the gospel.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1596, Fray Bernardo de Santa Catharina is elected provincial; under\n",
      "his rule, the conversion of the natives greatly increases. A new band\n",
      "of missionaries arrives soon afterward, most of whom go to the Cagayan\n",
      "field. In Cambodia Velloso and Blas Ruiz, Spanish adventurers, have\n",
      "aided the lawful king to regain his throne, and they persuade him to\n",
      "send to Manila requesting soldiers and the return of the two Dominican\n",
      "friars. Luis Perez Dasmarinas offers to make this expedition at his own\n",
      "cost, and Aduarte and Ximenez accompany him. A fierce storm scatters\n",
      "the ships; that of Dasmarinas is driven upon the coast of China,\n",
      "and that in which Aduarte sails is wrecked on one of the Babuyanes\n",
      "group. He sends word of this misfortune to Manila; the governor orders\n",
      "the Spaniards to proceed to China, on which coast they again suffer\n",
      "shipwreck, but find Dasmarinas--who has met a like disaster there,\n",
      "and is enduring great privations. Aduarte has meanwhile returned\n",
      "to Manila; but word of Dasmarinas's misfortune reaches that place,\n",
      "and Governor Tello sends him a ship with aid, and orders to return at\n",
      "once to Manila. Aduarte accompanies this vessel. He goes to Canton,\n",
      "to obtain the viceroy's permission for Dasmarinas's return to Manila;\n",
      "but there falls into the hands of a greedy and corrupt official, who,\n",
      "thinking to extort money from the friar, has him tortured. Finally,\n",
      "Aduarte is placed in prison with the Spanish sailors, but is soon\n",
      "bailed out by a Chinese friend. He makes his escape, and joins\n",
      "Dasmarinas; the latter returns to Manila, but Aduarte's health is\n",
      "so injured that he is obliged to halt at Macao. Fray Alonso Ximenez\n",
      "dies at that place, as a result of his hardships and sufferings in\n",
      "the Camboja expedition; a sketch of his life and virtues is given.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1597 another mission arrives at the islands, with Bishop\n",
      "Benavides. The intermediate chapter of the Dominican province is in\n",
      "session, and the new arrivals are therefore assigned to the needy\n",
      "missions; various incidents in those of Cagayan and Pangasinan\n",
      "are related. Biographical sketches of Antonio de Soria and other\n",
      "pioneer missionaries are given. Two of these are sent (1598) on a\n",
      "politico-religious mission to Camboja, with a Spanish officer named\n",
      "Mendoza; they are attacked by Malays, and most of the Spaniards\n",
      "are slain. The rest escape to Siam, but are attacked there also,\n",
      "with further loss of life. Among the dead are the two Dominicans\n",
      "and Mendoza.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the chapter-session of 1600, Juan de Santo Thomas is elected\n",
      "provincial. The Cagayan missions are extended further into the\n",
      "interior; and the religious zealously pursue and destroy any trace\n",
      "of idol-worship. At the intermediate chapter of 1602, the house of\n",
      "San Juan del Monte, without the city, is established as a retreat for\n",
      "convalescent brethren of the order. At that time occurs a miraculous\n",
      "healing of a friar possessed by an evil spirit; also, a large band of\n",
      "missionaries arrives from Spain, being divinely aided to escape various\n",
      "dangers of pestilence and shipwreck. With these friars all the convents\n",
      "in the province are supplied, and some even go to Japan. Aduarte\n",
      "explains the reason for Dominican missionaries being called to that\n",
      "country, and describes their first establishment, which is in Satsuma.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1603 the new king of Camboja asks the Manila government for soldiers\n",
      "and missionaries. Three Dominicans are sent, with a few soldiers as\n",
      "guards, and letters to the king. They are well received; but two\n",
      "of them die, and the factions in that country and the fickleness\n",
      "of the natives induce the remaining friar to return to Manila. In\n",
      "April, 1604, occurs the great conflagration in Manila, and, in the\n",
      "succeeding autumn, the revolt and massacre of the Chinese in and near\n",
      "that city--which have been fully described in previous volumes.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the chapter of 1604, Fray Miguel de San Jacinto is elected\n",
      "provincial, and several new churches in heathen communities are\n",
      "received. These are supplied with ministers from a new company that\n",
      "arrives that year from Spain. Some account is given of the journey\n",
      "of these friars, with its hardships and dangers--among these being\n",
      "an attack made upon them by hostile Indians at Guadalupe Island,\n",
      "in which six friars are slain and three wounded. Many of these new\n",
      "missionaries are sent to the Cagayan missions--some to the Itaves\n",
      "Indians, who were considered fierce and untamable by the Spaniards\n",
      "(some of whom, having oppressed the natives, were slain by them)\n",
      "until \"the holy gospel declared by the Dominican religious changed\n",
      "them from bloodthirsty wolves to gentle sheep.\" Aduarte declares\n",
      "that wonderful results were thus achieved, rendering those Indians\n",
      "moral and obedient, and achieving this entirely by kindness and\n",
      "gentleness. The Indians even consent to change their abodes to the\n",
      "mission reductions. The fathers are almost worn out by these tasks,\n",
      "and one dies; but they are encouraged by the wonderful results of\n",
      "their labor and by miracles which the Lord vouchsafes them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aduarte presents a long biographical account of Archbishop Benavides,\n",
      "Salazar's immediate successor. He is distinguished in Spain, both\n",
      "as a student and as an instructor. Coming to the Philippines, he\n",
      "immediately undertakes to learn the Chinese language, that he may\n",
      "minister to the men of that nation who come to Manila; and founds\n",
      "a hospital for the poor sick Chinese there. Benavides goes to China\n",
      "(as previously narrated), and afterward to Spain. There he does good\n",
      "service in refuting the opinion prevalent there that conquest must\n",
      "precede conversion, and soldiers clear the way for missionaries. He\n",
      "also procures the recall of a papal brief authorizing the bishops to\n",
      "visit the friars in charge of the Indians, the same as if they were\n",
      "parish priests; and accomplishes other important business, especially\n",
      "in behalf of the Indians, winning golden opinions of his abilities,\n",
      "good judgment, and virtue. Returning to the islands, Benavides takes\n",
      "charge of the diocese of Nueva Segovia, where he labors zealously\n",
      "for the moral improvement of the Spaniards, but most of all for the\n",
      "protection of the Indians from Spanish rapacity. After Salazar's\n",
      "death, Benavides takes charge of the vacant see, and is finally\n",
      "appointed archbishop; but his mode of life is always as simple and\n",
      "austere as that of the poorest friar, and he spends all his income in\n",
      "almsgiving. At his death, he bequeaths the little that he possesses to\n",
      "his brethren, for the founding of a college at Manila. Biographical\n",
      "accounts of other friars are presented. One of these, Jacinto Pardo,\n",
      "dies suddenly, it is supposed from poison given him by hostile\n",
      "Indians. Another, Juan de la Cruz, is a notable linguist.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1605, a papal brief (obtained by the Jesuits) forbids any religious\n",
      "to go to Japan except by way of India; but it is revoked three years\n",
      "later. This, in the interim, causes the friar orders much trouble;\n",
      "and Japan, moreover, is greatly unsettled and disturbed by various\n",
      "political matters. In 1606 an intermediate chapter is held at Manila,\n",
      "at which the religious of the order are directed to collect materials\n",
      "(of which Aduarte has availed himself) for a history of the Dominican\n",
      "province. The great victory of Acuna at Maluco, which occurs about\n",
      "that time, is ascribed to the agency of our Lady of the Rosary,\n",
      "to whom the Dominicans have a special devotion; a confraternity in\n",
      "her honor had been founded in Acuna's army, and the captured town is\n",
      "dedicated to her. In this same year, another company of religious\n",
      "arrives from Spain; one dies before reaching Manila. At this time,\n",
      "a Dominican mission is established in the province of Hizen, Japan.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1605 the mission in Pangasinan is extended to the village of\n",
      "Manaoag, farther inland; and, \"within a few months, there was not a\n",
      "heathen in the village.\" A chief in a neighboring village is also\n",
      "converted, to whom a miracle occurs. In 1607, two new churches\n",
      "are established in Cagayan. In Nalfotan the Indians, led by their\n",
      "excellent chief, build a church even before a missionary is sent to\n",
      "them; and all is prospering when a priestess of the old idols stirs\n",
      "up the people, against the new faith, and the villagers take to the\n",
      "hills. Later, they burn the church; but the good chief saves the\n",
      "missionary's life. Another revolt occurs in that province, caused\n",
      "by the cruelty of an encomendero. Troops are sent from Manila; their\n",
      "commander finds that the Indians had cause for revolt, and sends the\n",
      "people of Nalfotan home with their pastor. This mission prospers, and\n",
      "the chief is its mainstay during his life--a function long continued\n",
      "by his pious sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "The provincial chosen in 1608 is Baltasar Fort. Some account is given\n",
      "of the persecution of Christians in Japan; they are banished from\n",
      "Satsuma, but many find shelter in Nagasaki. The Dominicans accomplish\n",
      "much in Hizen. They also extend their missionary labors among the wild\n",
      "mountaineers of northern Luzon, gathering many scattered hamlets into\n",
      "larger villages, and converting many of their heathen inhabitants. In\n",
      "Ituy they attempt to open a mission, but the Franciscans claim that\n",
      "as their territory; the Dominicans yield, but regret to see these\n",
      "Indians abandoned soon afterward by their Franciscan teachers. In 1609\n",
      "the general of their order commands the provincials of the mission\n",
      "provinces to report every year the work and achievements of the\n",
      "missionaries, with information regarding the numbers and condition of\n",
      "the order in each province. Several friars die in that year, of whom\n",
      "biographical sketches are presented. One of these, Pedro Rodriguez,\n",
      "has rendered special and distinguished service in the hospital for\n",
      "Chinese at Manila.\n",

      "Even if the religious in this province of Nueva Segovia had done\n",
      "no other good than bringing to an end or preventing so many sins of\n",
      "idolatry as these Indians used to commit, every day and every hour,\n",
      "by adoring the devil and offering him superstitious reverence in\n",
      "all the ways which have already been described, a very great service\n",
      "indeed would have been done to the Lord, to whom all such actions as\n",
      "these are directly offensive. In these idolatrous acts His honor is\n",
      "taken from Him, and His divine supremacy is overthrown and given to\n",
      "His greatest enemy. To prevent one of these offenses to God would be\n",
      "of much more merit than to prevent any homicide whatsoever, for that\n",
      "is a direct offense only against a man; while idolatry is directly\n",
      "against God, and takes from Him His divine honor, which is much more\n",
      "valuable than the life of a man. If this be true, how high is the\n",
      "merit of having prevented the innumerable acts of idolatry which used\n",
      "to be committed daily by those Indians, and having brought to an end\n",
      "the multitude of sins which followed upon this one--constant wars,\n",
      "murders, robberies, drunkennesses which surpassed one another, lewd\n",
      "actions, and all the other vices which were committed--without the\n",
      "rulers of those people concerning themselves the least in them or\n",
      "punishing them, except when they personally were wronged. And this\n",
      "they did, not out of zeal for justice, but as their personal act of\n",
      "revenge, so that they sinned more in the excess of the punishment\n",
      "than the delinquents had sinned in the faults for which they were\n",
      "punished. Now all these evils came to an end, as the result of the\n",
      "preaching of the religious, to the great glory of God. Hence, if they\n",
      "had done no more than this, very great indeed would the service have\n",
      "been which thereby they wrought and continue to work for the Creator of\n",
      "all and the universal Lord. But this was not all; for when these evil\n",
      "growths had been rooted out, there were planted in the hearts of these\n",
      "Indians the opposite virtues. By the aid of the Lord they began so\n",
      "soon to bear flowers and fruit that the first bishop of this province,\n",
      "Don Fray Miguel de Venavides, a holy and most learned prelate, wrote\n",
      "to his Holiness Clement VIII, who at that time governed the church,\n",
      "the following report, in which he gives a faithful account of the\n",
      "establishment of his bishopric, with the accuracy to which his office\n",
      "and dignity obliged him. \"This province,\" he says, \"is very new in the\n",
      "preaching of the gospel, for it is only three years since there were\n",
      "ministers of the Order of St. Dominic in it. Before that time there\n",
      "used to be seen now and then a priest in the place where the Spaniards\n",
      "lived. As for preaching to the Indians, there was no idea of such a\n",
      "thing. This province is very near Great China, being distant from it\n",
      "less than seventy leguas; so that now the faith of the Lord appears\n",
      "to be approaching their powerful and great kingdom. The native race\n",
      "of the province is a very spirited one, whom it has cost the Spaniards\n",
      "many efforts and the lives of many men to subdue. As soon as the Order\n",
      "of St. Dominic came into this region, they immediately went to live\n",
      "among the Indians; and they built their churches and houses, which\n",
      "were more like huts built to last two days. They employed upon them\n",
      "very few laborers, and had no teacher or journeymen. The Indians would\n",
      "have died before they admitted them to their villages (and, as it was,\n",
      "there was some difficulty about it), if the good name of those who had\n",
      "been in Pangasinan had not reached these Indians also--who in this way\n",
      "learned how the religious treated the Indians as if they were their\n",
      "own children, and defended them against those who wronged them. When\n",
      "they began to consider the mode of life followed by the religious,\n",
      "their patience and labors, their avoidance of flesh food, their many\n",
      "fasts, continual prayers, great poverty--for the poverty of the Order\n",
      "of St. Dominic here is very great--and the gentleness and love with\n",
      "which they treated the natives, God was pleased that in those villages\n",
      "where there are missionary religious, all the inhabitants desired\n",
      "to be Christians. They have not only become very devout toward God,\n",
      "but very friendly to the Spaniards; thus the religious have put peace\n",
      "and security where they were not before. As a result, in regions where\n",
      "soldiers and garrisons used to be necessary, there now are none, and\n",
      "the country is very peaceful. Every evening the men gather together and\n",
      "recite prayers before a cross, which is usually set up in the plaza\n",
      "of the village, the women doing the same by themselves in another\n",
      "place. Baptisms in the heathen villages are constantly increasing,\n",
      "while those for whom there are not missionaries enough ask for them\n",
      "with all their hearts, and are so desirous to become Christians that\n",
      "we ought therefore to offer thanks to God. [Some chiefs invited the\n",
      "missionaries to their village, saying that they all wished to become\n",
      "Christians. A Spaniard who had command in one village where they were\n",
      "building a church, directed the soldiers to interfere with the work,\n",
      "which would have injured his private interests; but within a short\n",
      "time all those men died horribly. The fathers drive out devils from\n",
      "those who are possessed by them. It is only for lack of missionaries\n",
      "that the whole country is not filled with churches.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The report is very short, and it is therefore necessary for us to\n",
      "expand upon it, making use of the reports of the founders and first\n",
      "missionaries themselves. In addition to what has already been said,\n",
      "they report as follows. Great as was the labor of bringing these souls\n",
      "from darkness to light, they have come to understand their duties,\n",
      "worshiping the Lord with great devotion, and regularly attending\n",
      "His holy sacraments. They go beyond the commandments of God and of\n",
      "His church to do additional works of devotion--especially the women,\n",
      "for they can more easily come to be instructed, and can more easily\n",
      "do what they are told, as they are less occupied than the men are with\n",
      "things to distract their minds and thoughts. Some of them are so devout\n",
      "that they walk always in the presence of God, doing nothing without\n",
      "an inward prayer to Him. In Tular, or Abulug, a village of more than\n",
      "a thousand inhabitants, in which there were more communicants than\n",
      "in the other villages, the religious taught many of them to strive to\n",
      "meditate every day upon some of the mysteries of the rosary. This was\n",
      "an exercise to which the first founder of the province, father Fray\n",
      "Juan de Castro, was very much given, and in which many of his disciples\n",
      "and subjects have followed him. Thus these Indians day by day meditate\n",
      "upon one after another of the fifteen mysteries of the rosary. Other\n",
      "Indians lay aside part of their daily food for charity. Bringing\n",
      "about these results requires from the minister much labor, teaching,\n",
      "assistance, perseverance, and prayer; for without these there is very\n",
      "little or nothing that they can do of themselves, without books or\n",
      "any other guide to direct them. As it is, the Indians have advanced\n",
      "wonderfully--visiting and caring for their sick, especially when\n",
      "they are poor; taking discipline at night in their houses; fasting\n",
      "beyond what they are required; frequenting the churches; and offering\n",
      "their prayers at dawn and at evening. There were some of them who,\n",
      "at the very beginning of their Christian career, went through the\n",
      "fields looking for the little children of poor people who could not\n",
      "take them to town; and, bringing these to be baptized, they acted as\n",
      "their sponsors, making gifts to them afterward of swaddling-clothes\n",
      "or some such thing. Heavy as are the labors of the religious, their\n",
      "joy in them is still greater.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very great difficulty was found, at first, in bringing the Indians\n",
      "to confess. They regarded it as a shameful thing for them to report\n",
      "to the confessor all the evil things they had done and thought, and\n",
      "they also feared to give the religious power to annoy or blame them by\n",
      "means of their confession. \"When a dozen persons were gathered together\n",
      "for their first confession, there was not one of them who was willing\n",
      "to begin, for everyone wished the other to make the experiment. At\n",
      "last the fathers summoned an Indian who came from Pangasinan, and\n",
      "who had longer been a Christian and was better acquainted with the\n",
      "fathers. The Indians asked him many questions about the matter,\n",
      "all of which he answered well, encouraging them greatly; he told\n",
      "them that in his country the Christians confessed without any evil\n",
      "results following. At last one Indian woman, more courageous than\n",
      "the rest, ventured to go to make her confession where the father\n",
      "was patiently waiting in the church--commending the matter to God\n",
      "with all his heart, because it was very plain that the hesitation\n",
      "of the Indians was on account of the fear they felt. She confessed,\n",
      "went away very well satisfied, and, returning to the rest, told them\n",
      "what had happened. They asked her a thousand new questions, especially\n",
      "if the father was angry when she told her sins, and whether he had\n",
      "scolded her. She answered 'No,' and that, on the contrary, he had\n",
      "treated her very kindly and lovingly; so they all determined to make\n",
      "their confessions, and began them heartily.\" So they come now and make\n",
      "their confessions; and in general it is not necessary to summon them,\n",
      "for they anticipate the confessors, and sometimes even beg that their\n",
      "confessions may be heard, as a penance. They showed the greatest faith\n",
      "and sincerity in their confessions, striving to be reconciled with all\n",
      "their enemies before making their confession. The religious generally\n",
      "encouraged them to make their confessions on the day of their patron\n",
      "saint; and one Indian woman, named for St. Anne, was unwilling to\n",
      "confess on that saint's day. When the father asked her the reason,\n",
      "she answered that she had had a quarrel with one of her neighbors,\n",
      "and that they did not speak to each other; and she begged the father\n",
      "to reconcile them. After he had done that, she very readily made her\n",
      "confession. It frequently happens that a man accused in a court of\n",
      "law denies the accusation, and that the religious is unable to draw\n",
      "anything else from him; while in confession the same man will clearly\n",
      "accuse himself of the same fault which he had previously denied, and\n",
      "will deny again if the same question is asked him on another trial. It\n",
      "not infrequently happens that if they have any ill-will against the\n",
      "religious, or have said anything against him, they confess to that\n",
      "very man, telling him of the ill-will that they have felt against him.]\n",

      "[Since the most holy sacrament of the Eucharist is so high and\n",
      "difficult a thing to teach a people whose heathen state makes them\n",
      "opposed to ideas so lofty, the religious in this region spend a great\n",
      "deal of effort upon teaching the Indians this supreme mystery.] At\n",
      "first, only very few and very carefully chosen persons were admitted\n",
      "to the communion, according to the ordinance of a provincial council\n",
      "of Lima, confirmed by the Apostolic See, which in Act ii, chapter\n",
      "20, says, [1] Precepit sancta sinodus parochis, ceterisque Indorum\n",
      "praedicatoribus, ut saepe ac serio, de fide huius mysterii eos\n",
      "instituant; and, later, Quos autem parochus, et satis instructus,\n",
      "et correctione vitae idoneos iudicaverit, iis saltem in paschate,\n",

      "Indians of these regions have much greater capacity than those of Peru,\n",
      "of whom this council spoke; yet because they were so new in the faith,\n",
      "and so badly fitted by their ancient customs for this supreme mystery,\n",
      "the holy communion is not given to them indifferently at Easter, but\n",
      "is given to those whom the minister judges to be properly prepared. At\n",
      "the beginning, greater attention and caution were necessary. Hence,\n",
      "after they had been thoroughly instructed in the mysteries of the\n",
      "faith, and in particular in the doctrine of this holy mystery,\n",
      "and when they showed a desire to receive the holy communion, they\n",
      "were examined as to their lives, habits, and reputation, the most\n",
      "credible witnesses in the village being called in to testify. If\n",
      "they were found prepared, they were admitted to this supreme meal,\n",
      "to this holy table. A week before they communicated, unless they\n",
      "were occupied--and they generally gave up their occupations for this\n",
      "purpose--they went to church and heard spiritual addresses every\n",
      "day. [On these days they prepared themselves with more than ordinary\n",
      "prayer, and rose at midnight to pray and to take their discipline. If\n",
      "they were married, they separated their beds at least on the eve\n",
      "and the day of the communion. Many of the men went to the convent,\n",
      "and followed the hours with the religious. On the day of receiving\n",
      "communion, they followed the same customs as did the members of our\n",
      "order, dedicating the whole day to God, and keeping in it the silence\n",
      "which we observe in our convents on the day when those religious who\n",
      "are not priests communicate. They were taught to say something after\n",
      "mass in order to give thanks to the Lord; for since they cannot read,\n",
      "and have no books, the ministers have to teach them everything of\n",
      "this kind--especially at the beginning, for afterward there are many\n",
      "of them who teach the others. At the same time, they receive what the\n",
      "minister tells them with greater respect. Many extraordinary examples\n",
      "of piety have been exhibited by the communicants.] In the village\n",
      "of Pata there was an Indian chief, a man of great valor, named Don\n",
      "Francisco Yringan, of whom mention has several times been made. He,\n",
      "being governor there, had as a guest in his house a Spaniard who\n",
      "was traveling that way. He treated him kindly and entertained him as\n",
      "well as he could. The guest, not being content with this, asked him\n",
      "to find an Indian woman, that he might sleep with her; and gave him\n",
      "some trinkets with which to gratify her. But the Indian refused to\n",
      "accept them and to do what the Spaniard asked him, saying that this\n",
      "was wicked and that no one ought to do such a thing, least of all a\n",
      "communicant. This was a reply with which the old Christian ought to\n",
      "have been put to confusion, and which should have made him correct\n",
      "his desires; but it was not so; on the contrary, he grew angry at\n",
      "the answer, and threatened to cane the Indian unless he did what\n",
      "he was told. The Indian turned his back and bending his head said,\n",
      "\"Give me as much of a caning as you please, for I am not going to do\n",
      "what you ask.\" The Spaniard was so intemperate and discourteous that\n",
      "he vented his anger upon him and caned him, the Indian suffering with\n",
      "great patience, as if he had received from God not only faith in Him,\n",
      "but the power of suffering because he refused to offend Him. This is\n",
      "a grace which the Apostle praises, urging the Philippians to esteem\n",
      "it highly; and now it was found in a Philippine Indian. The Indian\n",
      "who suffered this was a man who could have employed lawyers against\n",
      "him who wronged him, though he was alone; and, if he had shouted to\n",
      "his followers, they would have cut the Spaniard to pieces. But, as he\n",
      "was a communicant, he would neither be an accomplice in the sin of the\n",
      "Spaniard, nor would he avenge himself; nor would he even make use of\n",
      "a just defense, as was taught in the counsel of Paul quoted above,\n",
      "Non vos defendentes carissimi [i.e., \"Not defending yourselves,\n",
      "beloved\"]. On another occasion when a great insult was offered to\n",
      "this same Indian, a religious comforted him and encouraged him to\n",
      "patience. The Indian answered: \"O father, how good it would be if we\n",
      "all served God with truth. If it were so, that wrong which has been\n",
      "done to me would not have been done. If this thing had happened in\n",
      "the days of our heathendom, it would have sufficed to cause me and\n",
      "my followers to make war to the death against this town; but now that\n",
      "we are Christians, patience!\" He said nothing more and uttered not a\n",
      "word of indignation, but passed over his sufferings and endured the\n",
      "insult, although he felt it keenly and was ashamed (though in a very\n",
      "Christian manner). Thus he gave proof that his virtue was enduring,\n",
      "because such a blow could not overthrow it. There was one poor Indian\n",
      "slave woman whom a Spaniard, who had communicated a few days before\n",
      "in that village, tried to violate. She resisted him with spirit; and,\n",
      "as if horrified at the lack of respect which by his actions he showed\n",
      "to the Lord, whom he had received, she said to him: \"How is it that,\n",
      "being a communicant, you dare to commit such a sin?\" In this way may\n",
      "be seen how some of the new Christians surpass others who are old\n",
      "in the faith, going beyond them in virtue, devotion, and the fear\n",
      "of God. [In the village of Masi, which is near to that of which we\n",
      "have been speaking, there was an Indian, a communicant, the fiscal\n",
      "of the church, who was of blameless life. His name was Sebastian\n",
      "Calelao. His sown rice had not sprouted on account of the drought;\n",
      "but, in response to his prayers, God sent rain so that his crop\n",
      "was saved. In Pilitan there was an Indian woman, named Ysabel Pato,\n",
      "a faithful Christian. When she was about to receive the viaticum,\n",
      "the priest found that the Lord had anticipated him. Other marvels and\n",
      "instances of virtue have been exhibited among these Indians.] Some\n",
      "Indian women accused themselves of having eaten buyos on fast-days,\n",
      "but not on Fridays. When the confessor asked them if they had\n",
      "fasted on other days than Friday--for the Indians are not obliged\n",
      "to fast on the other days in Lent--they answered that they fasted\n",
      "the whole of Lent, performing these fasts as works of devotion; for\n",
      "the holy Apostolic See has excused them from this fast, because of\n",
      "their weakness and the scantiness of their food. When the religious\n",
      "thought that this was excessive, and told them that they could not\n",
      "do so much, they answered that by the favor of God they could do\n",
      "so, as they had already fasted during the whole of Lent on previous\n",
      "occasions. The buyo is an aromatic leaf, shaped like an ivy-leaf,\n",
      "which the Indians are accustomed to chew with a sort of wild acorn\n",
      "and a little bit of lime. Even some of the Spaniards in this country\n",
      "very commonly use it, though they do not swallow it, so that only the\n",
      "juice reaches the stomach; it invigorates the stomach, and preserves\n",
      "the teeth. To carry some buyos in their mouths, if there were not\n",
      "many of them, would not break their fast; but in spite of all this,\n",
      "these Indian women made a scruple of taking it in their fasts, out of\n",
      "pure devotion and in an entirely voluntary way. [Visions of demons\n",
      "are frequent among the Indians. One such happened in a part of this\n",
      "province called Ytabes, of which the order took charge in 1604. The\n",
      "Indian concerned had a vision of demons driven away by persons whom\n",
      "he did not know, but who were clothed with white underneath and with\n",
      "black cloaks. This was something which the Indian had never seen,\n",
      "because the religious rarely wear their cloaks in the Indian villages,\n",
      "assuming them only when they go into the pulpit to preach. At that\n",
      "time the Christians there were so few that the sermons were not\n",
      "delivered from the pulpit, but from a seat, the cloak not being put\n",
      "on for the purpose. Frightful visions of the anito drove the father\n",
      "of Don Francisco Tuliau to baptism. In Camalaniugan father Fray Gaspar\n",

      "of them, who was the mistress of the others, saying that he entered\n",
      "her in the form of a shadow, and in that way gave his oracles. The\n",
      "aniteras were, as the Indians said, beside themselves and out of\n",
      "their minds at such times. Many miracles were wrought by the fathers,\n",
      "and they had great joy in the marvels which the Lord showed them\n",
      "in permitting them to save by holy baptism children and others who\n",
      "were at the point of death, from eternal damnation. The bishop of\n",
      "Nueva Segovia, Don Fray Diego de Soria, writing to his great friend,\n",
      "father Fray Bernardo de Sancta Cathalina, or Navarro, on March 24,\n",
      "1608, said that when they had come from the province of Ylocos, they\n",
      "had been detained in a port for two weeks by as heavy a storm as if\n",
      "they had been in Segovia itself, and that they had suffered much on\n",
      "the road; but that now they felt consoled by what they had found in\n",
      "the province, which was a perfect picture of Pangasinan. He reported\n",
      "that in the mountains of Fotol and Alamonag they had confirmed more\n",
      "than six hundred Indians; and that even the little boys and girls knew\n",
      "the definition of the sacrament of confirmation. He reports that the\n",
      "religious of the province are very harmonious, especially those who\n",
      "came from the college of Alcala, to which they purpose sending a golden\n",
      "cup worth a thousand pesos, hoping that the college may pay for it with\n",
      "missionaries, which will not be simony. He goes on to say that he had\n",
      "been three days in the village, and that they had already confirmed\n",
      "eight or nine thousand Indians. The cup of gold was sent, but never\n",
      "reached its destination. His remarks with reference to the college\n",
      "of Alcala are due to the fact that several of the religious who came\n",
      "over on various expeditions had been supplied by that college. Among\n",
      "them were some of the most devoted of the missionaries--for instance,\n",
      "the bishop himself, father Fray Bernardo de Sancta Cathalina, and\n",
      "father Fray Juan Cobo. The report of this father may well be followed\n",
      "by that of father Fray Francisco de San Joseph, or Blancas, [2] who\n",
      "wrote from this province of Nueva Segovia to the father provincial,\n",
      "father Fray Miguel de San Jacintho. His letter is given in full by\n",
      "Aduarte; the substance of it is as follows: \"I have seen with my own\n",
      "eyes something of what I have read in the letters of your Reverence\n",
      "with regard to the great need of ministers here, and to the desire of\n",
      "the people for them. We found the inhabitants kindly and peaceful, and\n",
      "delighted to see us. When we disembarked at one of the heathen villages\n",
      "on the way, some of the children ran to kiss our scapulars. Some of\n",
      "the boys ran before us, reciting the prayers very well, not because\n",
      "they had been taught, but because they had picked them up from a\n",
      "couple of our boys whom they had seen several times. Yet in spite of\n",
      "all this they will be lost and damned, for lack of friars. The wife\n",
      "of the governor of this village was very ill; and desiring to die\n",
      "a Christian, she had herself carried to the village of Pia, which\n",
      "is a Christian village about a day's journey from hers. Father Fray\n",
      "Pedro was at Pipig, a village near there, at the time, so that he was\n",
      "in time to baptize her.\" In another letter to the same provincial,\n",
      "he said: \"Your Reverence might see here this morning a company of\n",
      "old men learning the doctrines of Christianity; another of girls;\n",
      "another of married women; another of young boys--giving praises\n",
      "to God like so many choirs of angels, proclaiming His doctrine and\n",
      "learning it to prepare themselves for baptism.\" Father Fray Jacintho\n",
      "de San Geronimo, [3] who is still living, writes a letter to a friend\n",
      "of his in Nueva Espana, which is dated on the last day of the feast\n",
      "of the Resurrection, in 1607. It is substantially as follows: \"I am\n",
      "at present in the province of Nueva Segovia, in great happiness to\n",
      "see the desire of the people to become Christians. Our poverty and\n",
      "disinterestedness have caused them to have great confidence in us. I\n",
      "would not change my lot for any other in the world, in spite of the\n",
      "hardness of our life here.\" The same father wrote another letter to\n",
      "a friend in Manila, to the following effect: \"There are more than\n",
      "four thousand souls in this village, not the eighth part of whom are\n",
      "Christians, though all desire to become so. On Holy Saturday three of\n",
      "us baptized six hundred persons.\" The date of this letter was April 2,\n",
      "1607. Although this father had been but a short time in the province,\n",
      "he had already learned enough of the language for such great results,\n",
      "and could rejoice in the fruit of his labors. From all this it is\n",
      "plain that the missionaries in this region who are busied with the\n",
      "ministry of souls have no need of Espana nor of anything Spanish\n",
      "for their comfort, except companions to help them in the work. As\n",
      "there is no rule without an exception, it must be so in this case;\n",
      "but if any missionary is unhappy here, it is generally because he has\n",
      "failed in his obligations and become lukewarm in his devotions. Those\n",
      "that can speak the language and thereby convert souls are happy\n",
      "in their work; and those who cannot learn the language should\n",
      "accordingly be unhappy. But the Lord is not so poor as that, as will\n",
      "be sufficiently shown by a letter from father Fray Garcia de Oroz,\n",
      "written from Nueva Segovia to a brother at Manila: \"Though I have been\n",
      "told that I would be very unhappy and discouraged by the difficulty of\n",
      "learning the language, and though I find that it is very difficult to\n",
      "me because of my age and lack of memory, I am not disconsolate; because\n",
      "merely to be in company with a father who is a master of the language,\n",
      "and to act as his confessor, will greatly serve our Lord. This region\n",
      "is a pleasant one, and my health is good in it during the winter, which\n",
      "lasts from the beginning of October to March. It resembles the climate\n",
      "of Valencia during the same period, having cool and fresh nights. A\n",
      "great part of the country is very open, and the mountains are not high\n",
      "or rugged. Some of the convents are on the shore of the sea; others,\n",
      "on the bank of a copious river, which is navigated by canoes for a\n",
      "distance of sixty leguas up the river. No one has reached the head of\n",
      "it, or knows where the spring is.\" The happiness of the missionaries\n",
      "in their work will be plain from what has been said. As a result of\n",
      "having lived devoted lives they died happy deaths, rejoicing in their\n",
      "firm hope that they were going to enjoy the Lord whom they had served,\n",
      "and for whom they had abandoned their parents, kinsmen, native lands,\n",
      "and the ease which they might have enjoyed in Espana.]\n",

      "The servant of God, Don Fray Domingo de Salacar, first bishop of\n",
      "the Philippinas\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "By the ships which came to these islands from Nueva Espana in 1596,\n",
      "arrived the sad news of the death of their father and first bishop,\n",
      "Don Fray Domingo de Salacar. This was one of the greatest losses\n",
      "which they could have met with at that time, for they lost in him a\n",
      "most loving father and a most faithful defender. In their defense\n",
      "he had not hesitated to set out on a long and perilous journey to\n",
      "Espana, and that in his very last years, when his great age would\n",
      "have excused him from such excessive labors. But the fervent love\n",
      "which he had for his sheep would not permit him to offer any excuses,\n",
      "when he saw them in so great need as they were in at that time. There\n",
      "was in these regions no place from which he could obtain relief for\n",
      "them, nor could he have obtained relief from Espana if he had not\n",
      "gone there in person to get it, for he had tried all other means. He\n",
      "had sent a procurator; and he had written most urgent letters, and\n",
      "had learned by experience that they did not bring about the results\n",
      "desired. In fine, these islands lost a shepherd and a holy bishop;\n",
      "and when this has been said, everything has been said. The Order of\n",
      "St. Dominic, which had been so recently established in these islands,\n",
      "suffered the greatest loss in this general affliction, for it had\n",
      "in him a father and a brother who loved it most affectionately;\n",
      "and a continual benefactor, who, though he was poor in the extreme,\n",
      "seemed rich and generous in the benefits which he conferred upon the\n",
      "order. Without them it would have suffered much, because the religious\n",
      "came as apostolic preachers, in the greatest poverty, and in the\n",
      "greatest need of the favor which they always received from this pious\n",
      "bishop. Don Fray Domingo de Salacar was born in La Rioja in Castilla,\n",
      "and had assumed the habit in the distinguished convent of San Estevan\n",
      "at Salamanca, where he was contemporary with some who afterward became\n",
      "famous professors of theology in this illustrious university--the\n",
      "father masters Fray Domingo Banes and Fray Bartholome de Medina\n",
      "[Fray Domingo de Salacar was not inferior to them in scholarship,\n",
      "but his heart was set more on sanctity than on learning; and hence\n",
      "he desired to go to the province of Santiago de Mexico, which seemed\n",
      "to have renewed the primitive austerity of the time of our father\n",
      "St. Dominic. When he reached Mexico, though he wished to labor among\n",
      "the Indians, the orders of his superior kept him from doing so, and\n",
      "he became a teacher, and finally a master of theology, the highest\n",
      "degree of this kind which can be reached in the order. His virtue was\n",
      "such that during all the time while he was in Nueva Espana (namely,\n",
      "forty years), he never broke any of our sacred constitutions in any\n",
      "point. As one of the popes has said, a religious who thus follows the\n",
      "constitutions of our order, has done enough to be canonized. When the\n",
      "directions of his superiors at last permitted him to give the reins\n",
      "to his desire, he devoted himself to missionary work among the Indian\n",
      "tribes in the province of Vaxac. He suffered deeply from every wrong\n",
      "that the Spaniards did to the Indians; and his suffering was doubled\n",
      "because he could not remedy their wrongs. However, he did what he could\n",
      "for those that were under his charge by comforting them and encouraging\n",
      "them to patience; and it is no small consolation for the unfortunate\n",
      "to see that there is someone who pities them and sympathizes with their\n",
      "suffering. So desirous was father Fray Domingo of laboring for the Lord\n",
      "that he joined the expedition to Florida, [4] accompanying the holy\n",
      "Fray Domingo de la Anunciacion in the hardships which he endured,\n",
      "which he felt the more because he could not make the conversions\n",
      "which he hoped for among those Indians. Before beginning his journey,\n",
      "he asked the superior to bless all the waters of the streams and\n",
      "rivers from which he should have to drink, that he might not break\n",
      "the constitution which directs us not to drink without permission and\n",
      "a blessing. The want of food from which they suffered was such that\n",
      "they were obliged to boil the leather straps of their helmets and of\n",
      "the other parts of their armor that they might have something to keep\n",
      "them alive, or to delay death a little. When they had exhausted this\n",
      "supply they ate roots and the bark of wild trees. On this journey our\n",
      "Lady of the Rosary showed her favor to father Fray Domingo by assisting\n",
      "him in a remarkable way on several occasions. Once she enabled him\n",
      "to save the life of a poor soldier who had been condemned to death,\n",
      "and once gave him grace to change the heart of a man who intended to\n",
      "commit suicide. Although he desired to give himself to work among the\n",
      "Indians, he was obliged by the orders of his superiors and by his\n",
      "vow of obedience to assume several honorable posts in the province\n",
      "of Mexico, becoming prior and vicar-provincial, and finally the chief\n",
      "consultor of the Holy Office; but he gave up these positions as soon\n",
      "as he could to devote himself to the work which he preferred among\n",
      "the natives. He spent thirty-eight years in laboring for those poor\n",
      "people, teaching them, and protecting them against wrong. He was at\n",
      "one time sent to Espana by his superiors on matters of important\n",
      "business connected with the missions to the Indians. Here he met\n",
      "many difficulties, as vested interests and great wealth were arrayed\n",
      "against him; and on one occasion the nuncio of his Holiness, to\n",
      "whom he had complained, commanded him not to visit the palace. But,\n",
      "though he did not attain the end for which he set out, he made a\n",
      "great impression upon his Majesty, who appointed him first bishop of\n",
      "the Philippinas.] His Majesty felt a particular affection for these\n",
      "islands, because their conversion had begun in his time and as a\n",
      "result of his initiative. As they had received their name from his,\n",
      "he desired also to give them a bishop with his own hand. He chose a man\n",
      "whose learning, virtue, and deep zeal for the good and the protection\n",
      "of the Indians qualified him to be the father and first shepherd\n",
      "of regions so new and so remote from the presence of their king. In\n",
      "such regions it is very easy for the wrongs which the powerful do to\n",
      "the weak to be more and greater than in others; hence they needed a\n",
      "valiant defender, and a strong pastor and master to contend with the\n",
      "great difficulties which are always met with in new conquests. At\n",
      "first father Fray Domingo did not venture to accept the bishopric,\n",
      "and consulted learned and able religious. They all advised him to\n",
      "accept it, as being a very heavy charge, but one in which he could do\n",
      "great service to God and be of great advantage to the Indians. They\n",
      "suggested that, if he were the bishop of the Indians, he could\n",
      "help them better in the great sufferings which it might be expected\n",
      "that they would have to endure, as all newly-conquered people have\n",
      "endured them. These sufferings he saw and deplored when he went to his\n",
      "bishopric; and he strove to remedy them as completely as he could. He\n",
      "accepted the dignity for the labor and the banishment which it offered\n",
      "him, knowing well that there was no honor and profit to be expected\n",
      "from it. At this time he strove to bring with him religious of his own\n",
      "order, feeling that they would be more closely allied to him and under\n",
      "greater obligations to him; and that thus they would help him to carry\n",
      "his burden. His Majesty granted them to him, and they reached Mexico;\n",
      "[5] but here there were so many who died or fell ill that he had left\n",
      "but one companion, father Fray Christobal de Salvatierra--who was a\n",
      "wonderfully helpful associate, and aided him greatly in the government\n",
      "of his bishopric, as well as in everything else which had to be done;\n",
      "and these additional duties were neither few nor pleasant. He went to\n",
      "the city of Manila and built in it his cathedral church, assigning\n",
      "prebends and arranging everything necessary for the service of the\n",
      "cathedral--although poorly, because he had no ecclesiastical income,\n",
      "and because the royal income in these islands was very small. He found\n",
      "his bishopric like sheep without a shepherd, and strove to gather them\n",
      "together and bring them to order; but, as they had learned to live\n",
      "without control, they took his efforts very ill. Some of them broke\n",
      "bounds entirely, one of them going so far that he dared to tell the\n",
      "bishop to his face that he would better moderate his enthusiasm; for\n",
      "that if he did not, the speaker could hit a mitre at fifty paces with\n",
      "his arquebus. But the good bishop in these and similar cases followed\n",
      "the commands of St. Paul to his disciple St. Timothy: Argue, obsecra,\n",
      "increpa, in omni patientia et doctrina. [6] The good prelate put his\n",
      "shoulder and his breast to the wheel against all these difficulties,\n",
      "and with all his heart strove to reform the morals of the colony. By\n",
      "his example he animated the preachers and confessors to tell the\n",
      "truth with greater clearness and courage than before; and, that\n",
      "this might be the better and more effectively done, he called a\n",
      "conference, or quasi-synod, composed of the superiors from all the\n",
      "religious orders and of the learned men who were in the land, both\n",
      "theologians and jurists. This conference sat for a long time. In it\n",
      "there were also six captains who had had experience in that country,\n",
      "and in the conquests which had been made there. These officers were\n",
      "added to the conference that they might give information with regard\n",
      "to many matters of fact upon which the determination of justice and\n",
      "conscience in the case depended; and that the truth and righteousness\n",
      "of the proceedings of the conference might be more apparent. It was\n",
      "hoped that in this way the decisions of the conference would be better\n",
      "received. In this assembly the holy bishop showed his great capacity,\n",
      "his great knowledge and the clearness of his mind; and skilfully\n",
      "directed and disposed of a great variety of matters which were there\n",
      "very effectively decided. Many questions were there propounded and\n",
      "settled; and from the decrees of the conference there resulted a\n",
      "sort of general list or set of rules by which the confessors were\n",
      "to govern themselves in assigning penance to all sorts of people\n",
      "in that country. These rules affected the governor, the auditors,\n",
      "the royal officials, the alcaldes, the corregidors, those who had\n",
      "taken part in the conquest, the encomenderos, the collectors of\n",
      "tributes, and people of all ranks--in a word, all the inhabitants\n",
      "of the country. It had validity for what had been done as well as\n",
      "for what was to come. This was a very helpful matter, because it\n",
      "dealt with affairs which offered no precedents, did not regularly\n",
      "happen, and could not be understood by everyone because of their great\n",
      "difficulty. On this account those who understood them best, and desired\n",
      "to deal with them as truth and reason required, were not respected by\n",
      "those who were most concerned. The latter, in order that they might\n",
      "avoid their obligations, ordinarily tried to find confessors who would\n",
      "show leniency, to their own harm and to that of their penitents. But as\n",
      "soon as these decrees appeared, having been voted by so many learned\n",
      "and holy men, they were such that neither confessors nor penitents\n",
      "dared oppose them. This conference was accordingly a very important\n",
      "one; and in a few days it was possible to see the new light which had\n",
      "come to these islands and to perceive how thoughtful and careful,\n",
      "and how full of knowledge, was the new shepherd and spouse of this\n",
      "church. The holy bishop afforded much edification with his teaching,\n",
      "his addresses, and his sermons, for he was a learned theologian and an\n",
      "excellent preacher; but he did very much more by the example of his\n",
      "admirable life. The sermons which he preached in this way had great\n",
      "power over the souls of those who looked upon this noble example,\n",
      "and even hardened hearts could not resist them. He did not alter his\n",
      "habit, his bed, or his diet. His habit was of serge, as was customary\n",
      "in Nueva Espana. He wore a woolen shirt, and slept upon a bed which\n",
      "was even poorer than that of the poorest religious. His food was eggs\n",
      "and fish; his dwelling had no paintings or adornments in it. He rose\n",
      "at midnight to recite matins, and after this he offered his mental\n",
      "prayer. That he might not trouble anyone to give him a light, he\n",
      "always kept a tinder and flint, and struck and kindled his own light\n",
      "without having any servant to attend upon him when he went to bed or\n",
      "when he rose. He was especially devoted to our Lady of the Rosary,\n",
      "whose grace and favor he had many times experienced; and he desired\n",
      "to see this same devotion well established in all. When he spoke upon\n",
      "this matter, he seemed to surpass himself; and some believed that our\n",
      "Lady spoke in him, because of the grandeur of the heavenly ideas which\n",
      "he uttered on this subject. When our religious reached this country,\n",
      "he entertained them in his dwelling, as has been said; and he kept\n",
      "and cherished them there for many days, gave them extraordinary alms,\n",
      "and bought a site for their convent. He helped very much in the\n",
      "building of the convent, without ever feeling poor for this or for\n",
      "similar objects--though he was really in extreme poverty on account\n",
      "of the smallness of the salary which he received, without having\n",
      "any other source of income. Although the salary was small, it never\n",
      "failed him when the poor required it, to whom belonged everything\n",
      "that he acquired. Thus he was always consuming his income, without\n",
      "ever lacking something to give.\n",

      "The conformity of the good bishop with the divine will, and his desire\n",

      "always desired most intimately to unite himself, and the knowledge that\n",
      "he could not attain this approval without striving with all his heart\n",
      "to imitate His virtues, and by means of them to acquire something of\n",

      "opposed to them; and to multiply, in order to attain this victory over\n",
      "himself, penances and austerities, to the end that his nature might\n",

      "maintain, was that which the bishop most needed, for at every step\n",
      "occasions offered themselves for the exercise of this virtue. Since\n",
      "he was by nature wrathful and hot-tempered, and was always engaged\n",
      "in defending the right, it cost him much to control himself and to\n",
      "be patient. However, he had so restrained himself and so become lord\n",
      "of his nature, that he did not permit it to display itself. This\n",
      "was not only in cases where he had time for consideration and for\n",
      "preparation, but in those sudden and unexpected accidents in which\n",
      "those who are wronged are accustomed to lose control of themselves,\n",
      "if the virtue of patience is not well rooted within their souls or has\n",
      "not reached perfection. He was often obliged to hear many insulting\n",
      "words from soldiers who were angry because he had interfered with their\n",
      "excesses; but he kept silent, and walked on as if he had not heard\n",
      "them, attending to his business without taking any account of things\n",
      "which did not belong to it. Since the Indians suffered from the abuses\n",
      "which were inflicted upon them, he went in one day to speak on their\n",
      "behalf to the governor who was then in office. He was not permitted\n",
      "to proceed with his business without hearing many insulting words\n",
      "from the governor, who even put his hands upon his breast and gave\n",
      "him a push. The bishop did not change countenance; and, following the\n",
      "counsel of St. Paul, who bids us give place to wrath, he left the hall\n",
      "that he might not more inflame the wrath of this man. After a while,\n",
      "when he thought it was time, he went in again, and with great serenity\n",
      "of countenance and with gentleness of heart and words, he said to him:\n",
      "\"Bend your knees, because my heart does not permit me to leave you\n",
      "under so heavy a condemnation;\" and he added: \"By virtue of a brief\n",
      "of the Supreme Pontiff which I have for this purpose, I absolve you\n",
      "from the most dreadful excommunication which you have incurred.\" When\n",
      "he had done this, he went out again; and even commanded the cleric\n",
      "who accompanied him not to reveal to anyone what had happened, under\n",
      "penalty of excommunication. On another occasion another ecclesiastic\n",
      "whom he rebuked said to him, very angrily: \"How badly you treat me,\n",
      "though you know that I am better than you are.\" The bishop answered,\n",
      "with great calmness, that he was delighted to have in his bishopric so\n",
      "honorable a person. With this gentleness he suffered the blows of those\n",
      "who exercised his patience, leaving his cause to God, as God commands\n",
      "us. The Lord assumed the care of his cause, and rigorously chastised\n",
      "those who spoke evil of him. Some people wrote letters against him to\n",
      "Espana; and, before the answer came back, they were called upon to give\n",
      "their answer before the tribunal of God, ending their lives in sudden\n",
      "and dreadful death. He took great pains to preserve his chastity and\n",
      "the purity with which he was born, esteeming it highly like a precious\n",
      "jewel, and performing many penances to defend it from the assaults of\n",
      "the enemies who hated its beauty and ever strove to destroy it. Two\n",
      "priests have borne witness that he was a virgin: father Fray Diego\n",
      "de Soria, late bishop of Nueva Segovia, to whom he made a general\n",
      "confession in his old age, at the time when he was about to embark\n",
      "on the last voyage which he made to Espana. The other priest was a\n",
      "clergyman to whom he had confessed more than two hundred times, and\n",
      "who was well acquainted with the state of his conscience. This priest\n",
      "confirmed his testimony with an oath. In spite of this, the world\n",
      "is such that the chaste bishop found it necessary to defend himself\n",
      "against accusations in regard to this matter, and to bear testimony\n",
      "to the purity of his own conscience. At a public celebration of the\n",
      "holy sacrifice of the mass, with the divine sacrament in his hands, he\n",
      "affirmed, because necessity required it, that he hoped this celestial\n",
      "food might be his eternal damnation if he was conscious of any fault\n",
      "of such a kind. If those who spoke against him in this matter had\n",
      "been only laymen, angry because they had been corrected and forcibly\n",
      "drawn from such vices, and mad with passion--for such persons will\n",
      "not forgive those who are most holy--if this accusation had proceeded\n",
      "from such as these, it would have been matter for sorrow, but would\n",
      "not have been intolerable; but there were even some ecclesiastics\n",
      "who saw that the bishop took great pains to seclude abandoned women,\n",
      "and who ventured to make themselves defenders of these persons of\n",
      "disorderly life. They declared that a man who gathered in so many\n",
      "of these women of evil life (some of them handsome), shut them up,\n",
      "and heard them at their trials, would be sure to put out his hand and\n",
      "select those who pleased him. This reached the ears of the bishop;\n",
      "and the vengeance which he took was to commend them to the Lord in\n",
      "prayer with all his heart--pitying them as being persons who were\n",
      "really worthy of compassion; since, without comparison, the harm that\n",
      "one who speaks evil does to himself is greater than the harm done to\n",
      "him who is wronged. The Lord heard these pious prayers, and touched\n",
      "their hearts. They acknowledged the evil that they had spoken, and\n",
      "very repentantly came to beg his pardon, at the episcopal residence,\n",
      "in the presence of those who lived there. The bishop received them\n",
      "with open arms and with abundance of tears, and had them that day\n",
      "as companions at his table. The vengeance which the saints desire to\n",
      "take upon their enemies is, to have them repent for their faults when\n",
      "they become conscious of their errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was very compassionate, and felt the utmost pity for the sufferings\n",
      "of his neighbor. Of this a marked example was given on the voyage from\n",
      "Nueva Espana to Manila. There were in the same ship more than twenty\n",
      "Augustinian religious, and, while they were at sea, their water gave\n",
      "out. This is one of the greatest hardships which may be suffered on a\n",
      "voyage. The bishop took pity upon them; and, although he had not enough\n",
      "to supply the necessity of so many, he preferred suffering with the\n",
      "others to seeing them suffer while he was comfortable. Accordingly\n",
      "he offered them the opportunity to drink from what he carried in\n",
      "his martabana, which is a large jar holding twenty cantaros [7]\n",
      "of water. Their need would not permit them to refuse what was thus\n",
      "offered them voluntarily; and, though they all drank of it, the Lord\n",
      "was pleased that it should last until they landed on the islands,\n",
      "as the servant of God had prayed. It is no new or rare thing for the\n",
      "Lord to multiply food and drink, that it may not be lacking to those\n",
      "who bring themselves to need out of pity. This same virtue caused\n",
      "the bishop to watch over this municipality of Manila, by taking care\n",
      "that in the houses of the fathers of the Society [of Jesus] there\n",
      "should be religious to give instruction in profitable learning to\n",
      "those who desired to study it. That this might be made permanent,\n",
      "and that there might not be any failure in it, he brought it about\n",
      "that his Majesty gave command that the religious should receive an\n",
      "allowance to be spent upon the teachers. The answer of his Majesty is\n",
      "contained in the royal decree given at Barcelona the eighth [sic] of\n",
      "fifteen eighty-three. The document runs as follows: \"To the reverend\n",
      "father in Christ, Fray Domingo de Salacar, bishop of the Philippinas\n",
      "Islands. Three letters from you have been received from my Council,\n",
      "etc. Considering the good report which you give of the great results\n",
      "which have followed and which are likely to follow from the maintenance\n",
      "of the Order of the Society of Jesus, and considering that to this end\n",
      "it is necessary that the Society should receive from me what is needed\n",
      "for the support of the religious who desire to teach and instruct in\n",
      "Latinity, sciences and good morals, those who come to them, I have,\n",
      "until some one shall come forward to undertake this business, granted\n",
      "the decree enclosed. In pursuance of this decree, the president of\n",
      "the Audiencia and you will together determine how this object may\n",
      "be carried out,\" etc. From this same spirit of compassion arose the\n",
      "benevolence which he displayed toward all the natives by building\n",
      "a hospital in Manila in which sick Indians might be cared for. He\n",
      "gave so much energy to this that he not only was the chief person\n",
      "who concerned himself with it, but he gave the first and the chief\n",
      "contribution to establish and endow it. At the very beginning of\n",
      "the hospital he did something worthy of his virtue and prudence. The\n",
      "sick in this hospital were cared for by religious of the order of the\n",
      "seraphic father St. Francis, and particularly by a brother named Fray\n",
      "Juan Clemente. The infirmity for which they were ordinarily treated\n",
      "was buboes, which are very frequent on these poor Indians because\n",
      "they ordinarily have to walk in the water in their grain-fields. [8]\n",
      "The brother had much to suffer with the Indian men, and still more\n",
      "with the Indian women, the care of whom was in general not very\n",
      "consonant with decency. On this account, the religious determined\n",
      "to give up this duty, and actually asked the bishop for permission\n",
      "to leave the hospital. The bishop, who was well acquainted with the\n",
      "conscience of Fray Juan, and who saw the reason for his unhappiness,\n",
      "encouraged and consoled him; and exhorted him not to give up, on\n",
      "account of these temptations, the good work and the service which he\n",
      "had begun there. He gave the brother holy and devout reasons for this,\n",
      "and finally said: \"My son Fray Juan, fast for three days in the week;\n",
      "give yourself a discipline, and keep your hour of prayer. As for the\n",
      "rest, I will charge myself with it, and will take the responsibility\n",
      "upon myself.\" The result was marvelous, for, because of the good\n",
      "advice which had been given him and the prayer which the bishop made\n",
      "for him, Fray Juan found himself so much consoled and changed that he\n",
      "no longer felt the least difficulty or disquiet in the world; and,\n",
      "as if he had cast all these difficulties upon another person, he no\n",
      "longer perceived them in himself. Yet before this he had found himself\n",
      "so much oppressed by them that, in order not to fall, he had desired to\n",
      "flee. In a case of this kind, to take flight is to conquer--but not so\n",
      "nobly as when the Lord puts forth His hand that His servants may handle\n",
      "such serpents as these without being harmed by them, which happened\n",
      "in this case as the result of the prayer of His servant the bishop.\n",
      "\n",
      "The many virtues which this servant of God possessed were higher in\n",
      "degree as a result of the fire of charity which dwelt in his breast,\n",
      "which, as a queen of all the rest, held the highest place in his\n",
      "soul and governed all. He could not eat or drink in comfort without\n",
      "dividing with the poor; and therefore every day he set aside a part of\n",
      "his food, and, placing it on the corner of the table, said: \"You know\n",
      "for whom this is\"--namely, the poor, as his servants understood. This\n",
      "was given to them, and not only this, but other alms. That the matter\n",
      "might be the better attended to, they kept, by order of the bishop,\n",
      "a memorandum of the poor and needy of the city. He directed his\n",
      "servants that whenever the poor women who asked alms were Spaniards,\n",
      "they should indicate the fact by saying, \"Here is a lady that asks\n",
      "alms;\" if they were Indians or mestizas, they should say, \"Here is a\n",
      "woman.\" In this way, without seeing them, he would be able to tell\n",
      "their station, and to aid them conformably thereto. Still, when he\n",
      "was told about some such matter, he often went down with the servant;\n",
      "and, if it was the first time that she came, he used to say to her:\n",
      "\"Come, good friend, what is the matter now? Beware not to offend God,\n",
      "nor to be tricked by the devil into doing any base act for need or\n",
      "for selfish interest. Trust in God, who will aid you; and I for my\n",
      "part will assist with all my heart.\" In order that she might see that\n",
      "these were not merely good words, he used to give her some assistance\n",
      "and to write her name with the rest, so that he might aid her with the\n",
      "care required by her need, and by that of her children, if she had\n",
      "any. Every week he visited the prisons and the hospitals, generally\n",
      "assigning Fridays for that purpose. He encouraged and consoled the\n",
      "prisoners and the sick with kindly words and with alms, according\n",
      "to the need of each one. The money which he could get together from\n",
      "restitutions and confirmations he kept with the greatest care, that\n",
      "not a real might be lost; and, as if he were the most miserly man in\n",
      "the world, he took care of it for the poor alone, without permitting\n",
      "the members of his household or anyone else to take anything from the\n",
      "confirmations, as is customary. He used to say that this belonged to\n",
      "the poor, and that it was not proper that one who was not poor should\n",
      "share with them. From some of these alms, and from what he could add\n",
      "from his own poor income, he bought some lots near the Franciscan\n",
      "convent, and some cattle, with which he established a stock-farm,\n",
      "and gave it for the establishment of a hospital for the care of the\n",
      "natives. The hospital was built and still exists, having been very\n",
      "greatly increased by the care of the Franciscan fathers, who attend\n",
      "to it with the greatest charity. To exalt the hospital still more, the\n",
      "bishop obtained for it a liberal concession of plenary indulgence for\n",
      "the Sunday of Lazarus, [9] as he did for the hospital of the Spaniards\n",
      "on Palm Sunday. So great was his charity and his desire to do good to\n",
      "the poor that once, when he was without money to give them, he sold\n",
      "his pectoral cross, which was worth one thousand eight hundred pesos,\n",
      "and gave it to them in alms. In the same way went his table silver;\n",
      "and his silver pontifical ornaments were almost always in pawn. His\n",
      "steward used to try to excuse himself when he was told to give alms,\n",
      "saying that he had not the means. The bishop, calling him to one side,\n",
      "would say to him, \"Tell me the truth; how much money have you?\" He\n",
      "commonly said that there was not in the house more than eight reals\n",
      "for the daily expense, and sometimes only four. The bishop then\n",
      "made him give half of what he had, saying that it was sufficient\n",
      "good-fortune to have some money in the house all the time, so long as\n",
      "the Lord would provide more; and the Lord to whom he gave took care\n",
      "that he should never lack, sending him what he needed for himself\n",
      "and for his poor from some source from which he had never expected\n",
      "it. When he got it, he would show it to the steward, or give it to\n",
      "him, and say: \"Trust in God, father, and know that even if you had\n",
      "given me all that you had, the Lord would have sent us more.\" It was\n",
      "a common saying among the people of his household that the Father of\n",
      "the poor provided money miraculously, in order that the bishop might\n",
      "give them alms. A person of rank was once obliged by necessity to ask\n",
      "alms from him. The bishop was much grieved, as this person seemed to\n",
      "be an honorable one; and he directed the steward to give him all the\n",
      "money there was in the house. As he found no more than eight reals,\n",
      "the bishop gave this to him, and asked the man to pardon him, saying\n",
      "that there was no more at that time, but that, as soon as he had any,\n",
      "he would be sure to come to his aid. The Lord did not delay assisting\n",
      "him who had not only given alms from his superfluity, but had given\n",
      "all that he had for the maintenance of himself and his household. For\n",
      "on that very night He touched the heart of a man who had laid upon\n",
      "him for ten years the duty of the restitution of four hundred pesos,\n",
      "and caused him, without waiting till morning, to embark at night and\n",
      "to come from Cavite to Manila; and in the morning he gave the money to\n",
      "the bishop without the bishop's ever having spoken to him. The bishop\n",
      "had desired that his penniless condition should be cared for wholly by\n",
      "the Lord, who was called upon to relieve the urgent need of him who\n",
      "was in such need as a result of aiding the poor. When the bishop saw\n",
      "himself suddenly enriched with four hundred pesos, he gave thanks to\n",
      "the Lord, from whose hand he had received them rather than from the\n",
      "hand of him who had brought them hither. He instantly summoned the\n",
      "person to whom he had given only one peso the day before, because he\n",
      "had no more, and said to him: \"For the little which I have given you\n",
      "and the much which you desired, the Lord has sent me some money. Take\n",
      "these fifty pesos and give me that one which I gave you yesterday;\n",
      "for it is that which attracted all this. Be sure that you spend well\n",
      "that which I give you; and, when you shall see yourself in prosperity,\n",
      "take care to be liberal to the poor.\" The good man promised this;\n",
      "and in a short time God, in fulfilment of what the bishop had said\n",
      "to him, gave him so much money that he brought four hundred pesos,\n",
      "and gave them to the bishop to be distributed among the poor. The rest\n",
      "of what the bishop had received he did not spend on his household,\n",
      "though it was so poor; but published in the church that he had some\n",
      "money to distribute, and summoned the poor to his residence. Among\n",
      "them he distributed it (as he wished to) very quickly; and, showing\n",
      "them the eight-real piece which he had given in the first place,\n",
      "he said to them with much happiness and joy: \"Just this peso is for\n",
      "me, because it is that which attracted so many.\" When the bishop\n",
      "was at his meal, having with him at the table the first founders of\n",
      "this province, who had recently come to the city, a man came to beg\n",
      "alms. The bishop gave him a peso; and, as it seemed to the beggar\n",
      "too little, he showed it to the bishop, and said that he had not\n",
      "given him as much as he needed. This conduct appeared to those who\n",
      "were present bold, and even insolent; so they told the bishop that he\n",
      "ought to send the man away, because he had received sufficient alms,\n",
      "and that it was impossible at one time to succor every necessity. The\n",
      "bishop agreed; but before long his heart was moved to compassion\n",
      "at the thought that the poor man had gone away dissatisfied; and,\n",
      "with his eyes moist with tears, he said: \"Call that poor fellow back\n",
      "again. His need must be very great, because it has forced him to be\n",
      "importunate.\" The beggar came back; and the bishop, augmenting the\n",
      "alms so that the beggar should be contented, was contented himself,\n",
      "and sent him away with his blessing. Once it happened that he went\n",
      "to bed with fifteen pesos, which, though for persons of his dignity\n",
      "it was a mere nothing, for him who gave everything to the poor it\n",
      "was great riches; and in the morning before nine o'clock he had not a\n",
      "penny, because the poor had taken it all. He used to say: \"The riches\n",
      "of bishops are in caring for the poor, who are their proper purses;\n",
      "and, so long as my money is not in them, they will suppose that I have\n",
      "appropriated it.\" This did not appear only in his words, but he was\n",
      "so certain of the truth of it that he carried it out in practice; and\n",
      "it often resulted that he did not have money for the ordinary expenses\n",
      "of his household. He was obliged to set sail from Manila to Espana on\n",
      "important business; and one of the chief supplies which he ordered to\n",
      "be laid in was a provision of chickens and of conserves--things which\n",
      "he never tasted, and which were so foreign to his way of living that\n",
      "he ate nothing but fish, as if he had been in the refectory of an\n",
      "extremely austere convent. They got together three hundred chickens\n",
      "for him; but before he had left port two hundred of them were gone;\n",
      "while with the conserves and other things that he took he was all\n",
      "the time feasting and making presents to the poor and needy, so that\n",
      "nobody could even induce him to taste a chicken. [On the road from\n",
      "Mexico to San Juan de Ulua, though very ill, he charitably undertook\n",
      "the ordination of some candidates for the priesthood, who had been\n",
      "caught in a flood on their way to be ordained at Jalapa.]\n",

      "The marvels wrought by our Lord for His servants while in this life,\n",
      "and the happy death of the bishop.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "[It is not strange that the Lord should have honored the virtues of\n",
      "the bishop by working many marvels through him. Many of these have\n",
      "fallen into oblivion because he strove to keep them concealed, and\n",
      "also because there has been no one to keep a record of them. Several\n",
      "times his prayers have saved men in imminent danger of death; among\n",
      "these was father Fray Miguel de Venavides, who fell overboard on the\n",
      "voyage from Manila to Nueva Espana.]\n",
      "\n",
      "When he reached Espana it is said that his Majesty at first was vexed\n",
      "on account of his return, because his bishopric would need him during\n",
      "his absence. But afterward, when he saw him, his Majesty was greatly\n",
      "pleased with him, and carried out the wishes of the bishop in regard\n",
      "to the principal matters which had brought him there. The income of\n",
      "the church was greatly augmented, his Majesty bestowing upon him a\n",
      "large gift, and greatly increasing the small income assigned for the\n",
      "prebendaries. He succeeded in augmenting the number of prebends so that\n",
      "the church might be better served. A single bishop was not sufficient\n",
      "to attend to the confirmations and other episcopal acts in all the\n",
      "islands, still less to watch over the conversion of so many provinces\n",
      "as are contained in them, practically all of them being at that time\n",
      "heathen. Hence the bishop succeeded in having his bishopric divided\n",
      "among four prelates--an archbishop and three suffragan bishops--and\n",
      "he marked out the limits of each bishopric. He succeeded in gaining\n",
      "in Roma what he desired, and was himself appointed archbishop. This\n",
      "promotion did not suffice to alter the ordinary mode of life of this\n",
      "servant of God, and made no more change in him than if he had never\n",
      "been promoted. It is even said that he did not care to be informed\n",
      "or assured with regard to it; that as his soul had other purposes and\n",
      "more elevated desires, he cared little for these things. He was right\n",
      "in doing so, since he was soon to see how little substance there is\n",
      "in them; for he was attacked by a severe infirmity which, before the\n",
      "bulls for his archbishopric were despatched from Roma, despatched him\n",
      "to heaven, ending his labors and commencing his eternal rest. He had\n",
      "no need to make a will, for he distributed all that he could get among\n",
      "the poor. In the hour of his death, he had no more than six reals;\n",
      "and though he had a poor sister, he never gave her a real, because of\n",
      "his helping those who were in greater need. This came to the knowledge\n",
      "of his Majesty, and it pleased him so much that he displayed his royal\n",
      "generosity toward her, as indeed our Lord does command, who takes upon\n",
      "His own shoulders the obligations which His disciples fail to fulfil\n",
      "because of their love for Him. [These facts attracted great attention\n",
      "in the court, and the small estate of the bishop of the Indias became\n",
      "famous. He was buried in his convent of San Thomas at Madrid. The day\n",
      "before, the archbishop of Toledo had died, Don Gaspar de Quiroga; he\n",
      "was cardinal, and the richest prelate in Christendom. As he was to be\n",
      "buried on that same day, the counselors of the king did not know which\n",
      "funeral to attend; and his Majesty directed that they should go to\n",
      "that of the poorest. His epitaph states that he died December 4, 1594.]\n",

      "CHAPTER XLIV\n",
      "\n",
      "Father Fray Christobal de Salvatierra, associate of the first bishop\n",
      "of the Philippinas and governor of his bishopric.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There was but a short space of time between the death of the first\n",
      "bishop of this region of which we have just spoken, and that of his\n",
      "associate and vicar-general, father Fray Christobal de Salvatierra. The\n",
      "bishop, when he went to Espana, had selected him as governor of his\n",
      "bishopric--having by many years' acquaintance come to know that he was\n",
      "worthy, not only of this charge, but of much greater ones, because of\n",
      "his great and well-established virtue, his marked ability, singular\n",
      "prudence, watchful zeal for the honor of God, indomitable spirit,\n",
      "and the other noble qualities which he had found in father Fray\n",
      "Christobal. All these were necessary for the duties of vicar-general\n",
      "and governor of this bishopric at such times as these, which were so\n",
      "near to the first conquest of these islands. Even though the conquest\n",
      "had continued for some time, the very great difficulties encountered\n",
      "in their spiritual government will be evident. It will be even better\n",
      "understood by any one who has any knowledge of the conquests of the\n",
      "Indias; for though it did not involve so many cruelties as others,\n",
      "it was still impossible to avoid many evil deeds which wars always\n",
      "bring with them, however well justified they may be. This is still\n",
      "more the case against poor Indians, who cannot defend themselves,\n",
      "and sometimes who cannot even complain of the wrongs that have been\n",
      "done to them, since these are committed by those from whom their\n",
      "redress should proceed. Since there had not been in the islands,\n",
      "before the coming of the first bishop and his vicar-general, any\n",
      "bishop to govern them as their own prelate, the two ecclesiastics\n",
      "found them abounding in vices which by inveterate custom had put\n",
      "out such roots and obtained such strength that it was not possible\n",
      "to destroy them without great difficulty and labor, much vigilance,\n",
      "and a courageous spirit, in order to meet the thousand peril which\n",
      "these duties brought with them at this time. God, who never fails the\n",
      "government of His church, provided for these offices persons with such\n",
      "endowments as were possessed by father Fray Christobal. He was a son\n",
      "of the distinguished convent of San Esteban at Salamanca; and showed\n",
      "that he was so, not only by words, which often perish on the wind, but\n",
      "by works--and by noble works, which he had learned in that so prominent\n",
      "school of virtue and letters. He left his convent, intending to become\n",
      "one of the pioneers assembled by the bishop for this province. The\n",
      "number of these, as has been stated, was thirty. When they reached\n",
      "Nueva Espana, many died and others fell sick. The rest of them,\n",
      "daunted by the voyage which they had already taken, and attracted by\n",
      "the agreeable climate of Mexico, remained there. The good bishop was\n",
      "unable to persuade any of them to come to these regions except father\n",
      "Fray Christobal, who, like an immovable column, was always firm in his\n",
      "opposition to these temptations, never abandoned the company of the\n",
      "bishop, and remained constantly at his side--not only in this tempest,\n",
      "in which all the others fell away, but in all the other and greater\n",
      "tempests which afterwards fell upon them. He was greatly aided in this\n",
      "by the conformity that there was in the natures of the two men. They\n",
      "were both grave and prudent, intrepid of soul in the performance of\n",
      "the right, and fearful of everything that not only might be evil, but\n",
      "might even seem so. Above all, they were of one mind in their efforts\n",
      "to attain virtue--devout, chaste, charitable, religious; zealous for\n",
      "the honor of God, in themselves and in others; and ready for this\n",
      "cause to undergo hardships or dangers of any kind. Hence, though the\n",
      "dangers through which they had gone had conquered all the others and\n",
      "discouraged them, father Fray Christobal was always firm and faithful\n",
      "to his promise; and he accomplished it by persevering with constancy\n",
      "in that which he had begun, even until death. This he did to his own\n",
      "great good and to that of his neighbors, serving the Lord not only as\n",
      "one good religious, but as if he had been many. He was like another Aod\n",
      "[i.e., Ehud], working with both hands, and having spirit, courage, and\n",
      "industry for every undertaking of importance that offered itself. He\n",
      "carried on together the offices of vicar-general and of missionary\n",
      "to Bataan, at a day's journey from Manila, where he was obliged to\n",
      "reside. Withal, he filled the functions of these two positions,\n",
      "which seemed incompatible, with such perfection and vigilance,\n",
      "that he has left for each one of them eternal fame behind him. As if\n",
      "this was but little in itself, whenever any military expedition was\n",
      "undertaken he accompanied the soldiers, in the capacity of chaplain,\n",
      "as if he had been the most unoccupied person in the province. He gave\n",
      "his greatest energies to the office of vicar-general, which he filled\n",
      "with the greatest justice and watchfulness, and in which he offered\n",
      "a very edifying example. He was greatly loved by the good and feared\n",
      "by the bad; for his only purposes were to do good to all, to adjust\n",
      "their disputes, and to make friendships, or to unmake them when they\n",
      "were bad. He defended and protected the Indians, as being a race in\n",
      "the greatest need of defense and protection. When it was necessary,\n",
      "he chastised them, but like a loving father. Hence he was much loved\n",
      "by them, and was feared both by them and the Spaniards--even by the\n",
      "Spaniards in official positions, because, when there was a question as\n",
      "to making restitution for the honor of God, he pardoned no one. The\n",
      "zeal which he displayed in rooting out vices and scandalous sins\n",
      "was extraordinary. He never hesitated at any labor in this cause,\n",
      "however great it might be; he never feared any danger which appeared in\n",
      "the prosecution of his holy purpose, not even the danger of death. He\n",
      "was at one time threatened with death itself; for a desperate man\n",
      "entered his very room with the purpose of taking his life, at a time\n",
      "when he was careless and not expecting any such evil intention. But the\n",
      "Lord, to whom he left his defense, protected him; and the malevolent\n",
      "man was unable to carry out his purpose and to conquer the constancy\n",
      "of Fray Christobal. The latter knew that whatsoever hardship or\n",
      "death befell him in this way would surely be for his own greater\n",
      "glory; and hence, certain that no evil could happen to him that was\n",
      "really an evil, he did his duty with courage in opposing all the\n",
      "wicked, fearing no one, but feared by all. This was the case not\n",
      "only when he was present in the city or village where people were\n",
      "living scandalously, but even when he was at a distance from them;\n",
      "because without any warning he would appear, like a ray of light,\n",
      "in any place where he was needed. He would be at night in the city,\n",
      "and in the morning ten or twelve leguas away, following the track of\n",
      "those who were living in concubinage. When they seemed to themselves\n",
      "to be most safe, he caught them in flagranti delicto. He used to take\n",
      "out wicked women from any house, no matter how prominent it was,\n",
      "and no matter to what insults he might be exposed. Nothing of this\n",
      "kind daunted him, or held him back, or harmed him; nay, it did him\n",
      "much good, for, armed with patience for any wrong to himself, he was\n",
      "able to overcome any opposition to his holy zeal, and came out always\n",
      "victorious and with the upper hand. He knew the women of evil life so\n",
      "well that they were not able to escape him, or to conceal themselves\n",
      "from him. The punishment which he gave them was very appropriate,\n",
      "because he shut them up in a secure place and forced them to work\n",
      "to earn their living; and this, on account of their licentiousness\n",
      "and idleness, was the worst punishment that could be inflicted upon\n",
      "them, while for the holy purposes of Fray Christoval, it was the most\n",
      "efficacious remedy which could be applied. By being shut up they were\n",
      "kept from the sins which were caused by their being at large; while\n",
      "by their bodily labor they paid for something of what they wasted\n",
      "in their idleness. Hence in the time of this father this wretched\n",
      "class of people fled to the mountains, without daring to appear\n",
      "in the city. The Spaniards feared and hesitated to do many things\n",
      "which after his days began to be very common. All of these actions\n",
      "of the father were accompanied by such prudence, purity of life\n",
      "and manners, and by such love and such good works for the people,\n",
      "that although at the time those who were blinded and carried away\n",
      "by their passions suffered greatly, and were very angry with the\n",
      "man who interfered with their vices, still afterwards, when their\n",
      "minds became calmed, they could not fail to recognize the goodness\n",
      "of father Fray Christobal. He even gained the hearts of these people,\n",
      "and forced them to love and esteem them. Wherever he went, he received\n",
      "information from the most honorable people of what needed a remedy;\n",
      "and being sure that they were persons who would not deceive him,\n",
      "he immediately applied the remedy, with the least possible cost to\n",
      "the delinquents. He knew them all very well, and knew how to treat\n",
      "them. Hence with some he used no more rigorous means than looking at\n",
      "them, and letting them know that he was acquainted with their faults;\n",
      "and this was enough to bring about their improvement, which was what\n",
      "he purposed and desired. But when more severe measures were requisite,\n",
      "he was not slow or hesitating in employing them. Accordingly he was\n",
      "very useful to God in his office by attacking many sins and scandals,\n",
      "and by preventing others (which is an act of higher prudence). For\n",
      "the juridical acts which he performed as an ecclesiastical judge he\n",
      "accepted no fees, and he moderated as much as possible the fees of\n",
      "the officials of his jurisdiction. Since he understood the language\n",
      "of the Indians, he had no need of an interpreter, a matter of great\n",
      "importance and the means of avoiding much injury, deceit, and expense\n",
      "in the suits of the Indians. Since their means are very small, it is\n",
      "very easy to distort justice by bribing them, unless the activity\n",
      "of the judges prevents this evil. Even when this does not happen,\n",
      "the expenses of suitors are always very large. The vicar-general\n",
      "was desirous of avoiding these expenses, and therefore employed no\n",
      "interpreter, as in everything he took care that all might plead and\n",
      "gain their rights at small expense. This is an evidence that the great\n",
      "fear which he caused was not due to the fact that he was quarrelsome\n",
      "or litigious, but because he was zealous for the honor of God and the\n",
      "good of the souls that were in his care. So long as the bishop was\n",
      "in the islands, he had some comfort and defense; but as soon as the\n",
      "bishop had gone to Espana the father, being the sole governor of the\n",
      "bishopric (which at that time included all the islands), could not fail\n",
      "to suffer from the great increase of his labors, and greatly feel the\n",
      "want of the bishop's support. The thing to which he gave the greatest\n",
      "amount of attention and in which he found the greatest difficulty,\n",
      "was the prohibition to the Chinese heathen of the comedies that they\n",
      "performed, and to Spanish men and women attendance on those comedies,\n",
      "on account of the manner in which they were performed, which was full\n",
      "of superstition and idolatry. Up to the time when our religious had\n",
      "come, there was no one who understood their language and customs, so\n",
      "no one paid any attention to this point. The Chinese felt sure that\n",
      "no one but themselves could understand their comedies, and performed\n",
      "them as in China, full of superstitions and idolatries. This was found\n",
      "out by Father Juan Cobo when he had learned their language, letters,\n",
      "and customs. He gave notice thereof to the vicar-general, who ordered\n",
      "the comedies to cease, as being superstitious. The Chinese were greatly\n",
      "grieved, and so were the Spaniards--the latter because, although they\n",
      "did not understand the comedies, they enjoyed seeing them for the sake\n",
      "of the actions and representations which the Chinese make in a very\n",
      "realistic way; and the Chinese, because they are devoted to this kind\n",
      "of entertainment. So every one, including the governor, was opposed\n",
      "to the vicar-general. He, because he did not understand the evil in\n",
      "the thing, took the side of the Chinese; but the vicar-general was\n",
      "certain that these comedies were an offense to the Lord, as well for\n",
      "the reason stated as because they were performed by night, and many\n",
      "other evil results used to follow. They were attended at night by\n",
      "Spanish men and Spanish women and their female servants, and by other\n",
      "Indian women--who, covered by the dark cloak of night, did many things\n",
      "which ought not to be done in Christian lands. But the vicar-general\n",
      "put his shoulder to the difficulty, and commanded that no one, on\n",
      "pain of excommunication, should go to see the comedies. Since the\n",
      "governor was of the opposite opinion, there was no one who dared to\n",
      "publish the excommunications; so the vicar-general himself went and\n",
      "fastened them on the church-doors, accompanied only by his friars,\n",
      "since there was no one else who ventured to accompany him. At last,\n",
      "although it cost him much and much evil was said against him, he\n",
      "brought this evil practice to an end. Since that time Spanish men,\n",
      "and many more Spanish women, do not go to see these comedies; and no\n",
      "permission is given for their performance until they are first looked\n",
      "over and approved by a religious who understands the language, and\n",
      "who sees that they are not superstitious but are historical, or have\n",
      "plots which are not idolatrous. This is what ought to be done in the\n",
      "realms of a Catholic prince, although the comedies are performed by\n",
      "heathens and idolaters; for as the latter are not permitted to perform\n",
      "their idolatries, they ought not to be permitted to play superstitious\n",
      "comedies made in honor of false gods, for such comedies are part of the\n",
      "idolatry, which is forbidden to them. It would be supposed that father\n",
      "Fray Christobal, being so busy and so usefully occupied, would have no\n",
      "time to attend to anything else except to his position as governor and\n",
      "vicar-general of this diocese. Yet this was not the case, but whenever\n",
      "the opportunity was offered--as was not often, there being then so few\n",
      "whom he could employ--he took advantage of it to leave his duties for\n",
      "the time. Hence when the first Spaniards went to the pacification or\n",
      "conquest of Nueva Segovia, he went as chaplain of the soldiers, and\n",
      "was with them in all the conflicts which they had with the Japanese,\n",
      "which conflicts have already been described. He was the first priest\n",
      "that entered that country--as it were, to take possession of it for the\n",
      "friars of his order, who afterward converted it to the law of God and\n",
      "to His gospel. In the same way, when another expedition was made to\n",
      "Maluco, he embarked as chaplain, purposing in both expeditions to do\n",
      "the greater service to his king and lord by restraining the soldiers,\n",
      "by his authority and by the respect which they had for him, from the\n",
      "disorders which the inconsiderate are likely to be guilty of under\n",
      "such circumstances as these. This same desire of being useful in all\n",
      "things caused him to take charge of the district of Bataan, which,\n",
      "although it contained many Christians, had no minister and no one to\n",
      "take pity upon them or to assume the charge of them. This aroused great\n",
      "compassion in him; and though these Indians were a day's journey by sea\n",
      "from Manila, where he was obliged to reside, he assumed the ministry\n",
      "to them and cared for them with great solicitude and love and with\n",
      "no less labor. [The situation of that district made the labor of the\n",
      "ministry very great. Father Fray Christobal went on foot through all\n",
      "the lakes and swamps, attending to the needs of all the Indians, for\n",
      "whom the four religious who succeeded him were scarcely able to do the\n",
      "work. He did all this labor in spite of a painful ailment from which\n",
      "he suffered. Among the things which afflicted him was the necessity of\n",
      "sleeping in his clothes for the little time when he could repose. This\n",
      "is no small discomfort in so hot a country. His love for the Indians\n",
      "was such that, although his labors caused him this painful infirmity,\n",
      "he devoted himself to them up to the time of the coming of the other\n",
      "missionaries; and even after they came he used to take his holidays\n",
      "by visiting these Indians as his beloved sons. He greatly assisted the\n",
      "first religious to learn who were and who were not Christians, for the\n",
      "absence or loss of records had brought everything into confusion. He\n",
      "was very charitable, especially to the Indians. To the Spaniards he\n",
      "was a father and a master, assisting them in all their necessities\n",
      "in peace and in war. He showed his zeal for the honor of God and\n",
      "for the rooting out of vice in the very last hours of his life,\n",
      "by writing to the governor, Don Luis Perez das Marinas, the request\n",
      "that he would have a bad woman taken from a captain's house which he\n",
      "indicated; and that he would send three soldiers to arrest a cleric\n",
      "of whom the report was spread that he was leading an evil life. The\n",
      "asthma from which he had so long suffered finally brought his life\n",
      "to an end. He died in the hospital of the Sangleys, in the midst\n",
      "of the brethren of his order.] He was mourned by the whole country,\n",
      "and especially by the religious of all the orders who were in it. All\n",
      "declared that there would never again come to this region such a friar,\n",
      "such a governor of the diocese, such a father of the poor, such a\n",
      "zealot for the honor of God, a man of such gifts for everything. When\n",
      "he died, the need of him was exhibited by the public way in which\n",
      "those vices which, so long as he lived, dared not appear or lift up\n",
      "their heads, began to prevail in the country. He received a solemn\n",
      "interment, attended by the ecclesiastical chapter and by all the\n",
      "religious orders, to all of whom he had done many friendly acts,\n",
      "and by all of whom he was therefore heartily beloved. At this very\n",
      "day his fame is as much alive as if he had died but yesterday. He\n",
      "appointed to be governors of the diocese, by the authority which he\n",
      "had received therefor from the bishop (whose death was not yet known),\n",
      "father Fray Alonso Ximenez, provincial of this province, and father\n",
      "Fray Juan de San Pedro Martyr, or Maldonado. The ecclesiastical chapter\n",
      "resisted; and although the nominees plainly had right on their side,\n",
      "and the governor, Don Luis Perez das Marinas, offered to put them in\n",
      "possession, they were unwilling to obtain the control of the bishopric\n",
      "by lawsuits. They renounced or did not accept the appointment, and left\n",
      "the government to the chapter, as something which should not be sought\n",
      "or even received except as the result of compulsion or sheer necessity,\n",
      "not for one's own advantage, but for the common weal--which very seldom\n",
      "is attained when the entry upon such offices is obtained by lawsuits.\n",

      "\n",
      "Father Fray Juan de Castro, one of the first founders of this province\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "[When father Fray Juan de Chrisostomo went to Rome to get the documents\n",
      "necessary for founding the new province, he carefully looked in every\n",
      "one of the convents that he visited for men of the devotion, prudence,\n",
      "and holiness which he regarded as necessary for a firm establishment\n",
      "of the new province. In it the rule and the constitutions were to\n",
      "be punctually observed, and the religious were not to be contented\n",
      "with observing them as others do, for we all profess to observe them\n",
      "as they were written. He purposed to make this province one of such\n",
      "virtue that it should be not only holy in itself, but should have\n",
      "power by the aid of the Lord to fix holiness and virtue in the souls of\n",
      "persons so alienated from them as were these Indians, who had always\n",
      "been in the service of the devil. Among those upon whom father Fray\n",
      "Juan Chrisostomo turned his eyes was father Juan de Castro, of the\n",
      "convent of Sancta Cathalina in Barcelona. He was from the city of\n",
      "Burgos, and was the nephew of the other father, Fray Juan de Castro,\n",
      "the provincial of this province. God always shows His power in His\n",
      "saints; but to be superior among many saints, to shine with special\n",
      "glory among shining stars, is a much more marvelous effect of the\n",
      "divine grace. Such was father Fray Juan de Castro in this convent,\n",
      "which of itself has the name of being a very religious one; and\n",
      "father Fray Juan Chrisostomo selected him for the high end which\n",
      "he designed. Christ our Lord did not need to seek for holy men. His\n",
      "divine power was such that He could make apostles of great sinners,\n",
      "like St. Matthew or St. Paul; but Father Juan Chrisostomo, being a\n",
      "man, was obliged to choose, for the foundation of the province upon\n",
      "which he had begun, persons whose holiness was already formed. In\n",
      "order to obtain father Fray Juan de Castro, he caused the general\n",
      "of the order to assign him by name to the new enterprise. In this\n",
      "way the convent of Barcelona, much as they regretted losing Father\n",
      "Juan de Castro, were obliged to let him go to the Philippinas. His\n",
      "uncle, having been appointed to the leadership of this company, sent\n",
      "his nephew to the most laborious, but most meritorious part of the\n",
      "work--namely, to the province of Pangasinan. Father Fray Juan, to\n",
      "save the other fathers from hardship, carried water from the river,\n",
      "brought and split the wood, kindled and stirred the fire, and was,\n",
      "in a word, the servant of the rest; he anticipated all the others\n",
      "in these works and labors, so that the rest of the religious might\n",
      "not be wearied out, and that the Indians might not be annoyed, or\n",
      "feel ill-will toward the preachers of the gospel, by being forced,\n",
      "against their declared intention, to bring what was necessary for\n",
      "the services of the church and of the poor convent. He suffered the\n",
      "lack of food with special content and joy. He took great care of the\n",
      "neatness and cleanliness of the church and the altar. In spiritual\n",
      "things he distinguished himself as he did in these material labors;\n",
      "yet his uncle did not appoint him to any place as superior, but gave\n",
      "him that which he most delighted in, the position of the greatest\n",
      "labor and the lowest honor. When the heaviest part of the duty in\n",
      "Pangasinan was over, the Lord ordained that he should seek labor\n",
      "somewhere else. It was decided to send an embassy to China after the\n",
      "death of the governor, Gomez Perez das Marinas. He had been killed\n",
      "by some Chinese traitors, who had afterwards made their escape with\n",
      "the galley, in which was the royal standard, much good artillery,\n",
      "and other things of value. The purpose of the embassy was to demand\n",
      "justice upon these traitors. On account of father Fray Juan Cobo's\n",
      "success in the embassy to Japan, it was decided to select religious\n",
      "of the same order for the present embassy. Father Fray Luis Gandullo\n",
      "was accordingly chosen, and named as his associate father Fray Juan de\n",
      "Castro. As secular ambassador went Don Fernando de Castro, cousin of\n",
      "the governor who sent the embassy, and nephew of the dead governor. A\n",
      "storm blew them out of their course toward the province of Chincheo,\n",
      "to which they had intended to go, and drove them to the province of\n",
      "Canton, one of the thirteen into which the Chinese realm is divided. As\n",
      "the Chinese there had had no dealings with the people of Manila, they\n",
      "did not receive the ambassadors with the respect due their office,\n",
      "or with the kindness which ought to be shown to men who had suffered\n",
      "so from the storms of the sea. They were arrested on the charge of\n",
      "piracy, but, by giving two hostages, they obtained somewhat better\n",
      "treatment. They were finally permitted to go to Macan, and afterward\n",
      "proceeded to Chincheo, but could not find a trace of the galley which\n",
      "they were looking for. The traitors had not gone back to their own\n",
      "country, but to a neighboring kingdom which was less civilized and had\n",
      "less justice. Some of them, not expecting to be recognized, afterward\n",
      "ventured to go to Malaca, and paid for their crime with death. At\n",
      "last the ambassadors returned, without having obtained any of the\n",
      "results which were desired from the embassy. The fathers, however,\n",
      "had at least carried the sweet savor of the Christian religion to\n",
      "those regions. On the return journey, they met with such a storm that\n",
      "the vessel was lost, and the people aboard her had to save themselves\n",
      "by swimming. Father Fray Juan de Castro was carried by a plank to the\n",
      "coast of Pangasinan, a day's journey from the coast of Bolinao, where\n",
      "the wreck occurred. The exposure brought on a severe illness. Father\n",
      "Fray Juan was taken to Manila and died in the hospital of the Chinese,\n",
      "passing away serenely and devoutly.]\n",

      "\n",
      "The journey made by the father provincial Fray Alonso Ximenez to\n",
      "Camboxa\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "[After father Fray Alonso Ximenez had completed his provincialate,\n",
      "he went to Camboxa to preach the gospel there. Circumstances seemed\n",
      "to make this absolutely necessary. In 1595 there came to the city\n",
      "of Manila as ambassadors from the king of Camboxa two soldiers--a\n",
      "Portuguese, named Diego Velloso; and a Castilian, a native of La\n",
      "Mancha, named Blas Ruiz de Fernan Goncales. The kingdom of Camboxa\n",
      "is on the mainland, like China and like Spain. The king asked the\n",
      "governor of Manila for soldiers to assist in the defense of his kingdom\n",
      "against the king of Siam, his neighbor; and also for Dominican friars,\n",
      "to preach the law of God in his kingdom. The people of Camboja have\n",
      "special knowledge of our order because of some religious, from the\n",
      "India of Portugal, who lived there a long time. [10] One of them, named\n",
      "Fray Silvestre, was so highly esteemed by the king that he had him\n",
      "about his person continually. The Portuguese, however, were unwilling\n",
      "to attempt the conversion of this region, because they thought,\n",
      "and quite properly, that they could not carry it on to advantage\n",
      "from India. The governor, in spite of the small force of soldiers\n",
      "which he had, and the religious order, although likewise they had\n",
      "but few laborers, decided to do what they could to fulfil the wishes\n",
      "of the king. The order accordingly appointed the father provincial,\n",
      "who was within a few months of the end of his term. The governor gave\n",
      "him the title of ambassador, associating with him in the embassy\n",
      "the commander of the forces, Captain Juan Xuarez Gallinato. Great\n",
      "difficulty was found in providing an ecclesiastical companion for the\n",
      "father provincial, as those who were at first suggested could not be\n",
      "spared from their duties. Finally I was appointed, accepting this duty\n",
      "in accordance with my vow of obedience. Three vessels were prepared\n",
      "for the expedition, one of them of Spanish build, the other two of\n",
      "the sort used in this country which are known as juncos. These are\n",
      "large boats, and carry a great deal of freight; but they are weakly\n",
      "built to meet the storms, and have very little rigging on their\n",
      "masts, and accordingly are easily lost in bad weather. A hundred and\n",
      "thirty soldiers were collected, most of them without permission of\n",
      "the governor, who had given his license for only forty. There were\n",
      "also some Japanese, who are too much given to rashness in war; and\n",
      "some Indians of this country, who on occasions of honor are very\n",
      "good auxiliaries. The leader of the expedition [i.e., Gallinato]\n",
      "commanded the frigate; Diego Velloso, the smaller junk, in which we\n",
      "religious went; and Blas Ruiz de Fernan Goncalez, the larger, which\n",
      "contained most of the forces. [11] January 18, 1596, we set sail\n",
      "from the harbor of Manila, badly equipped and worse accommodated,\n",
      "as usually happens on such occasions. We went to the island of Luban,\n",
      "[12] fourteen leguas from the fort, to finish our preparations for the\n",
      "voyage, which, though it is but a short one (only two hundred leguas in\n",
      "length), is across a treacherous sea; for the best-fitted vessels often\n",
      "suffer severely upon it, much more so those which are poorly equipped,\n",
      "as were ours. The frigate and the smaller junk made port that night;\n",
      "but the larger junk was unable to enter, and was not to be seen in\n",
      "the morning. We assumed, as was true, that it had taken advantage of\n",
      "the favorable wind and proceeded with its journey. We were, however,\n",
      "anxious; because it was not well supplied with food or water, though\n",
      "it was better supplied than the other vessels. Two days afterward,\n",
      "we set sail; but on a calm sea, and with the wind fair, our mainmast\n",
      "snapped as if it had been made of candy. It was all rotten; and we\n",
      "were left like a cart on the water, with nothing but our foresail,\n",
      "and that very small. The flagship took us in tow and we towed a\n",
      "small boat with four Chinese sailors, which was the cause of no\n",
      "little trouble. We sailed in this way for eight days, the sea being\n",
      "calm. One night at the end of this time, the boat cable broke. The\n",
      "sailors that were in the boat called out for us to wait for them;\n",
      "and the flagship hove to, and began to sound while we were waiting\n",
      "for the boat. Finding bottom in forty brazas, they perceived that we\n",
      "were near the country of Camboja. In order to reach port early on the\n",
      "following day, they left us, thinking that in spite of the smallness\n",
      "of our sail we could reach there on the same day. The result, however,\n",
      "was not as was expected; for by bad navigation we had gone many leguas\n",
      "to leeward of the port. To make our way back there we had to sail\n",
      "against the wind. A storm arose soon after, and the flagship was\n",
      "obliged to run before the wind; it made port in Malaca, more than\n",
      "two hundred leguas to leeward of its destination, and was unable to\n",
      "return for three months. Our vessel could not make sail against the\n",
      "sea, being entirely unequipped, and good for nothing but to ask for\n",
      "the mercy of God. Under these circumstances fell the night between\n",
      "the eighth and ninth of February. We all supposed that this was the\n",
      "last of our days, and no man expected to see the next morning. The\n",
      "force of the wind drove us aground more than two leguas from shore; we\n",
      "had to cut away the stump of the mainmast, which was still standing,\n",
      "and to throw into the sea the rudder and everything there was in\n",
      "the ship. The boat, which might have saved us, was swamped; and the\n",
      "sailors who were in it got aboard the ship. The waves broke over the\n",
      "vessel, but could not sink it because it was already fast aground.] I\n",
      "sat all that night in the waist (for it was impossible to stand),\n",
      "confessing the Christians and catechizing the heathen. I baptized\n",
      "twenty-two of them, feeling that the great danger in which we were,\n",
      "authorized the act. When they had all received the sacraments,\n",
      "I encouraged them to the work which was necessary to keep us from\n",
      "perishing. Several times I went into the poop to confess myself,\n",
      "and to receive the confession of the holy old man, my provincial,\n",
      "who was there waiting for death--at the point of which we now were,\n",
      "with the rope, as they say, about our necks. We could do nothing but\n",
      "put up supplications and appeal from the justice to the mercy of God,\n",
      "by whom sentence of death seemed to have been issued upon us. It was,\n",
      "however, only a sentence of warning; and He accepted our prayer for\n",
      "the time, giving us hope that with His aid we might atone for our\n",
      "transgressions. The efficacy of God's mercy we almost felt with our\n",
      "hands on this occasion; for death appeared to be actually upon us,\n",
      "making execution upon the lives of those who were there. We were\n",
      "somewhat encouraged by the hope of reaching the land which was so\n",
      "near to us; but we did not know what it was, and what we were to\n",
      "expect from it. If we had known, we would have preferred to die in\n",
      "the sea; for our sufferings in this way would have been less than\n",
      "those which we underwent by reaching the land. We were like those\n",
      "of whom Jeremiah speaks in his Lamentations, for whom it would have\n",
      "been better to have the lot of those who died with the sword at one\n",
      "stroke than of those whose lives were brought to an end by hunger;\n",
      "for the latter died a prolonged and painful death, being destroyed\n",
      "by the barrenness of the land. The barrenness of this coast was such\n",
      "that it greatly exceeded that of which Jeremiah speaks. It was such\n",
      "that no one would go to it, even to escape death, unless, like us,\n",
      "he was not acquainted with it. Finally those waves which were on their\n",
      "way to burst upon the shore pushed on the ship, which was practically\n",
      "empty, and went along as if it had been a dry stick. This was a result\n",
      "of the coming in of the tide, and when the tide ebbed afterwards,\n",
      "we were left aground, a cannon-shot from the sea; and we saw in the\n",
      "mud (of which all this coast is composed) the track of the ship like\n",
      "a trench, for the force of the sea as it rose had pushed it along,\n",
      "breaking a road in the very ground. On this same day the tide came in\n",
      "again with such fury, because it was a spring-tide, that it carried\n",
      "the ship up to the trees and even buffeted it about there with such\n",
      "violence that we were obliged to disembark for fear of perishing\n",
      "in it. When we were on shore, exploring parties went off in various\n",
      "directions. After they had made an arduous march, they brought back\n",
      "the news that it was a wilderness inhabited only by wild beasts,\n",
      "without any trace of a river or a spring, at least near the coast;\n",
      "and that the country within proved to be inaccessible because it was\n",
      "overflowed and very thickly overgrown. This news made us feel that\n",
      "the sea was less evil for us than such a land, and that the tortures\n",
      "which we had endured were slight compared with those to which we were\n",
      "exposed by this desired but unhappy landing. Since eating and drinking\n",
      "are a necessary and a daily obligation, and as our supply of food\n",
      "and drink was very small, while we were more than a hundred persons,\n",
      "we put forth all our energies to search for some remedy. As thirst\n",
      "was that from which we suffered most, we dug wells in the dryest\n",
      "parts we found, and when we met water, it was more salty than that\n",
      "of the sea. I declare, as one who has found out by experience, that\n",
      "the very dew which appeared in the morning on the leaves of the wild\n",
      "trees there, was salt. Hence since the land denied us the sustenance\n",
      "which we required, we determined to return to the sea, which had at\n",
      "least granted us our lives, and which now gave us greater hopes than\n",
      "the land of being able to preserve them. For this it was necessary to\n",
      "help ourselves by means of the unlucky ship which was stranded on the\n",
      "shore, for it had remained there after the spring tide was over. It\n",
      "had no masts, or sails, or rudder, or anything that could be used,\n",
      "because between losing them and perishing there had been no choice. To\n",
      "supply these, it was necessary to put our hands to the work, until\n",
      "it was finished. The most necessary thing to be done to the ship was\n",
      "to cut it down and fit it so that it would draw but little water, and\n",
      "might be rowed along the coast. Our relief was to be sought on land,\n",
      "but he who should find it had to seek for it by sea. We were not now\n",
      "planning for conquests or embassies, but for getting water--for which\n",
      "we would have given all that has been yielded by the hill of Potosi,\n",
      "if it had been ours. We spent ten days in getting the ship ready. We\n",
      "cast overboard all the upper works and a good part of the under\n",
      "works. We fitted to it twelve oars. In this way it was like a badly\n",
      "made galliot; rudder, masts, and sails we replaced by rowing. While\n",
      "some of us were at this work, others went to explore the country,\n",
      "doing their utmost in the search for water. Some of these came back\n",
      "very joyful, with good news, saying that about four leguas up the\n",
      "coast from there a great river ran up into the land; that where it\n",
      "flowed into the sea the water was salt, but that it must be fresh\n",
      "above. They also said that they had seen the footprints of men on the\n",
      "shore. The work was hurried on in the hope of satisfying our thirst,\n",
      "which was increased by it, and still more by the heat of that region;\n",
      "for we were in the most torrid part of the torrid zone, and had\n",
      "practically no defense or covering against the heat. The vessel,\n",
      "being of so light a draught, was easily launched; and embarking in\n",
      "it all that we had left of provisions and clothes, which was very\n",
      "little, we put forth one evening and entered the bight of the river\n",
      "of which we have spoken, reaching its mouth in the morning by hard\n",
      "rowing. We entered it with great delight, which was increased by the\n",
      "sight of a hut on the bank not far from the ocean. Though there was\n",
      "no one in it, we promised ourselves large towns when we saw it, and\n",
      "even assured ourselves of certain news of our companions, of whom as\n",
      "yet we knew nothing, nor they of us. But within a few days we found\n",
      "out the deceit and lost our joy in it. After going for three days up\n",
      "the river, we constantly found the water salt like that of the sea,\n",
      "whose arm it was, and not a river. Upon its banks on either side\n",
      "there was nothing but impassable undergrowth. At last we reached a\n",
      "point from which we could not go further up, because the seeming river\n",
      "divided into so many little creeks that the ship had not room in any\n",
      "of them. The change from the false hope of water and of towns, which\n",
      "had possessed our minds, served to redouble our misery; since now, as\n",
      "it seemed to us, we had lost the hope of relief by land or by sea. Our\n",
      "necessity had now reached such an extreme that the food was distributed\n",
      "by ounces, and the drink almost by drops--though the labor of rowing,\n",
      "each man in his turn (from which no one was excused), was such as to\n",
      "require much food; and the heat was so excessive that even if we had\n",
      "been in idleness we should have needed much to drink. But at last,\n",
      "having confidence in the Father of mercies--who, though He distresses,\n",
      "does not overwhelm; and, though He chastises, does not slay--we\n",
      "returned to the sea by which we had come. At sight of it we left the\n",
      "vessel, in order to rest a little from the labor which we had endured\n",
      "to attain that for which we were hoping; and I went on land with my\n",
      "four Chinese (with whom I was very intimate), and had them build a\n",
      "little boat of four planks--fastened together by some twigs, so to\n",
      "speak, for we had no nails; and calked with clay, for we had no tow,\n",
      "or any other thing better than the clay. This made a sort of canoe. If\n",
      "awkwardly handled, it filled with water. But, such as it was, I had\n",
      "two of the soldiers get into it--for if they kept close to shore they\n",
      "would run no risk--and told them to go up to the hut that we had seen\n",
      "to discover whether there were any people there; because perhaps they\n",
      "had hidden themselves, from fear of our vessel, when they saw it on\n",
      "the way up the river. They did so, and at nightfall they discovered\n",
      "two grown Indians and a boy. They made their way up to them, little by\n",
      "little; and when they got near them they found that they were asleep\n",
      "on the shore, not expecting anything to happen to them. They caught\n",
      "the Indians, and bound them. When the rest of us came by soon after\n",
      "in our ship, they called out from the land, telling us what they had\n",
      "done. Our joy was so great that to render thanks the holy old man\n",
      "and I sang a Te Deum laudamus; and at this hour, which was midnight,\n",
      "half a cuartillo [i.e., pint] of water was served out to the troops\n",
      "in token of joy. The soldiers came on board with their captives,\n",
      "treating them gently and showing them all sorts of kindness. It\n",
      "seemed to us that God had sent them to us as angels to guide us,\n",
      "as He sent St. Raphael to Tobias. We began to put questions to them\n",
      "by an interpreter, asking what country this was, what population it\n",
      "had; and where they had come from, and where they ate and drank. They\n",
      "answered that they were from Camboxa, and that the country along this\n",
      "coast, and inland for many leguas, was uninhabited; and that to go\n",
      "to the towns we should have to enter a large river and to sail up\n",
      "for eighty leguas. They said that large vessels went up the river,\n",
      "and that it was many leguas to windward of this place. They declared\n",
      "that they were natives of that country, slaves of one of its chief\n",
      "lords; and that, because of the ill treatment which they had received,\n",
      "they had fled from him, and had come hither where no man had ever\n",
      "landed. They said that they ate nothing except shell-fish, which\n",
      "they caught with their hands, and wild cocoanuts, that grew there;\n",
      "and that they had no other water except what fell from heaven. When\n",
      "it rained they caught what they could and kept it in some large reeds\n",
      "to drink afterward. They said that two years had passed since they\n",
      "had come there. The effect of such sad news upon the hearts of men\n",
      "who had suffered as we had may easily be imagined. They also told\n",
      "us that some days' journey further there was a port; but that, if\n",
      "we meant to go inland, where the king was, it would be necessary to\n",
      "leave the vessel at the port, because there was no river that entered\n",
      "inland. Since our desire was only not to die of thirst, any means by\n",
      "which we could get water seemed easy and light to us. We accordingly\n",
      "set out by sea in search of this port, taking these Indians with us,\n",
      "not with the purpose of increasing consumers when we had so little\n",
      "to consume, but to have guides. We went along the coast, running\n",
      "up to it very often wherever we thought we saw any signs of water,\n",
      "and sometimes digging wells, but always in vain, for the land could\n",
      "not give what it did not have. On the day of St. Matthew the Apostle,\n",
      "we discovered a high island in the sea, named Pulonubi. [13] It was\n",
      "about six leguas from land. We laid our course toward it in search\n",
      "of water, thinking that doubtless it would have some, being high and\n",
      "mountainous, and having a sandy shore; but as the equipment of the\n",
      "ship was fastened on with pins, as the saying is, our rudder broke,\n",
      "when we had gone out a legua to sea. Being buffeted by the slight sea\n",
      "which was running, we had to return to land, and even to run aground,\n",
      "in order to mend the rudder. The Lord seemed to have declared that He\n",
      "intended to bring death upon us, because the sustenance necessary for\n",
      "our life was entirely consumed; for since we had no water, we were\n",
      "not only without drink, but also without food, our provision being\n",
      "rice, which cannot be eaten unless it is boiled in water. For lack\n",
      "of water, some ate it parched, which dried their entrails. Others\n",
      "ate it imperfectly boiled in the steam of salt water, putting it\n",
      "in a little basket over a pot of this water on the fire, so that by\n",
      "the steam thus sent out it might be softened. The water was so salt\n",
      "that it made the rice like itself, and left it uneatable. There were\n",
      "some who, even after this fine example of cookery, drank sea-water,\n",
      "which increased the thirst they were so impatiently desiring to\n",
      "remedy. Others distilled it over the fire and got some fresh water,\n",
      "but very little, at the expense of much wood and with the necessity\n",
      "of keeping up fire day and night, which dried them more than the\n",
      "water that they got moistened them. All this taught us the great need\n",
      "in which we live, with our life on a thread, and the Lord many times\n",
      "threatening to cut it short. When we had mended the rudder as well as\n",
      "we could at the time, we went on up the coast, being disillusioned,\n",
      "so that we would not have thought of going out to sea even if the\n",
      "ocean had been as smooth as milk. Three days later, the twenty-seventh\n",
      "of February, which was Shrove Tuesday, we took our hands from the\n",
      "oars and placed ourselves in those of God, despairing of life. The\n",
      "remedy came to us as from God's own hand without our expecting it,\n",
      "when we were overcome by labor, and dying of hunger and thirst, and\n",
      "had given up ourselves to death. Thus it is most certain that the Lord\n",
      "comes to the aid of him who calls upon Him when all things created\n",
      "fail him--blessed be God's holy name. We had reached such an extremity\n",
      "that of that sorry ration of water which we had now had about a month,\n",
      "and which was less than half a cuartillo daily for each person, there\n",
      "was only enough for two days. We were not now thinking of making\n",
      "any effort to find any, but had our minds wholly turned to preparing\n",
      "ourselves for death, when the Lord of life ordained that the waves\n",
      "of the sea should drive us into a little inlet which the land formed\n",
      "there, where we went on shore with the intention of never leaving the\n",
      "place, but of ending in it our voyage and our lives. It happened that\n",
      "one of the Indians in the ship went to bathe in the water, to relieve\n",
      "the great heat from which he suffered, and somewhat to moderate the\n",
      "thirst which was destroying us. He swam to land, and there right on the\n",
      "shore (which was muddy, like all of that along which we had coasted),\n",
      "his feet sank in at the foot of a wild palm-tree. Feeling that they\n",
      "had gone into water, he drew them out, applied his lips to the hole\n",
      "which he had made, and found that the water was fresh. The thirst\n",
      "from which he suffered not permitting him to wait until it settled,\n",
      "he drank mud and water until he was satisfied. He shouted to us to\n",
      "tell us what he had discovered, but no one believed him. At last,\n",
      "the Indian persisting in his affirmation, all hurried to the water\n",
      "to look upon this marvel, which might be compared to that which God\n",
      "performed in drawing water from a rock that His people might drink in\n",
      "the desert; for no less miraculous appeared to us this fresh water\n",
      "in a marsh so near the ocean. We gave God a thousand thanks, and\n",
      "rejoicing in the feast, we forgot the labor and the fasting which\n",
      "we had undergone in the long vigil. We easily dug a well, for the\n",
      "whole soil was muddy, and on the next morning we filled all our casks\n",
      "with the water, which had now settled. We set sail to look for food,\n",
      "and even aspired to greater things. [In a few days we reached the\n",
      "port, where there was a garrison of Indians against their neighbors,\n",
      "the Siamese. All the news which we obtained about our comrades, and\n",
      "about the country to which we had come, was bad. The flagship had\n",
      "not been heard of, and the other ship was at Churdumuco, which is a\n",
      "large town eight leguas from the port and eighty from the sea. [14]\n",
      "We were told that the king who had sent for us from Manila, and\n",
      "whose name was Langara, was not in the country; but that his place\n",
      "in the kingdom had been taken by his chief vassal, because of the\n",
      "following circumstances. The king of Sian had made war against the\n",
      "king of Camboja, with eight hundred thousand men. This number should\n",
      "not astonish anyone, because the kings could make war almost at no\n",
      "expense, their vassals providing their own arms and food. The king\n",
      "of Camboja did not dare to wait for so great a multitude of enemies,\n",
      "and retreated up the river to another kingdom known as that of the\n",
      "Laos. The king of Siam made himself master of the country, and after\n",
      "burning it all returned to his own country, being harassed by hunger,\n",
      "which made more war upon him than did the king his enemy. The army\n",
      "being in disorder, one of the chiefs of Camboja, with those who had\n",
      "retreated to the mountains (about thirty thousand men), attacked\n",
      "his rearguard, thus obliging him to hasten his retreat. This chief,\n",
      "having conquered him who had conquered his king, took possession of\n",
      "the kingdom. The new king regarded those who had come at the request\n",
      "of the previous king as allies of his enemy, and therefore as his own\n",
      "enemies. This news alarmed us greatly, as we were without our comrades,\n",
      "our commander-in-chief, and our ships. However, being obliged to\n",
      "disembark, and to put ourselves into the hands of the rulers of the\n",
      "country, we made an honest man of the thief, as the proverb goes,\n",
      "and decided to send a soldier to him as an ambassador--offering to\n",
      "him our aid and service, on the ground that we had come to help the\n",
      "king of this country, and found no other king in it but him. The king\n",
      "received him kindly, saying that he only held the kingdom as a regent,\n",
      "and that he was ready to restore it to the lawful king when he should\n",
      "return. He sent an order to the mandarin of the coast where we were,\n",
      "to provide us with boats and carts. The soldier on his return met the\n",
      "Spaniards of the other ship, and learned from them that all that the\n",
      "king had said was false and that his purpose was to kill us at his\n",
      "ease. They advised us to join them in their ship, dissimulating in\n",
      "regard to our affairs, and keeping on our guard. The father provincial\n",
      "sent me ahead to confess those in the ship, because it was Lent,\n",
      "and they had sent to him to ask for a confessor. I was on foot and\n",
      "suffered much, although some things that I saw on the journey afforded\n",
      "me some alleviation of these hardships. I one day reached a village\n",
      "where there was a monastery of religious of their sort, of whom there\n",
      "are many in this kingdom. I went to it and talked to a venerable old\n",
      "man, who was as it were the superior of it. He was seated on a little\n",
      "platform about a palm's breadth in height, with a small mat on it,\n",
      "and the others sat on the ground. Without saying anything, I sat down\n",
      "next to the old man--at which they smiled, thinking that I had done\n",
      "so because I did not understand the custom of the country, which did\n",
      "not permit that. We both showed each other much courtesy by signs,\n",
      "and I by using some words of their language which I knew, although,\n",
      "because I did not put them together properly, they laughed much. They\n",
      "gave me a collation of some fruits; and the sacristan immediately took\n",
      "me to his temple, which was at some distance from the house. It had a\n",
      "sort of cemetery about it, surrounded by some slightly raised stones\n",
      "which divided it from the rest. The door to the temple was small, and\n",
      "the temple itself was arched, round, and small. (Here follows a full\n",
      "account of the appearance of the temple. Some description of their\n",
      "prayers and of their religious customs is also given. Aduarte states,\n",
      "upon the authority of the Portuguese religious, that these native monks\n",
      "are vicious and licentious in the extreme.) I finally reached the ship\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "[By the sufferings and danger which we had passed through, the Lord\n",
      "had prepared us to endure those which were to follow. To protect the\n",
      "ship, some of the men had encamped on a little sand island in the\n",
      "middle of the river. On one bank was the town (i.e., Chordamuco)\n",
      "of the natives, near which there were about two thousand Chinese,\n",
      "some settled here, others who had recently come from China as traders,\n",
      "with their merchandise, in five large vessels, which they kept in the\n",
      "river near the town. They had controlled the natives, and resented\n",
      "the coming of the Spaniards, thinking that the latter had come to\n",
      "disturb or take away the superiority which they had. So they sought\n",
      "for an opportunity to quarrel with them, seeing that the Spaniards\n",
      "were few and that they were many. Whenever the men on the ship went to\n",
      "buy food on land, the Chinese tried their patience by annoying them\n",
      "without any reason. By orders of the captain, Blas Ruyz de Fernan\n",
      "Goncalez, they endured this annoyance, though sorely against their\n",
      "will. The captain sent a message to the king asking him to bring the\n",
      "Chinese to order. The king spoke fair words, but did nothing. Finally,\n",
      "the anger of our men got beyond their control. On the Sunday after\n",
      "Easter, when all had received communion, three or four were in the\n",
      "town with the captain's permission. One of them came back with his\n",
      "sword drawn, saying that the Chinese had chased and abused them, and\n",
      "that they had not dared to violate the captain's orders. The troops\n",
      "armed themselves, and, breaking away from all restraints, went to take\n",
      "vengeance on the Chinese. I went along to calm the Chinese, if I could,\n",
      "by speaking to them in their language, which I understood. They were\n",
      "all armed with their catanas (a sort of hanger), and languinatas, or\n",
      "long knives drawn to a point. I dared not put myself in their hands,\n",
      "because I was told that they would be better pleased to get me than\n",
      "anyone else. Soon after, sixty of our men in two companies, with some\n",
      "of our Japanese and Indians, came ashore and instantly attacked the\n",
      "Chinese. As our bullets took effect at such a distance that the latter\n",
      "could not attack our troops hand to hand, the Chinese were routed;\n",
      "and our men followed, killing them, until they had driven them out of\n",
      "the town. The natives of the country took no part in the conflict on\n",
      "either side. I saved as many lives as I could. The soldiers, seeing\n",
      "themselves masters of the field, pursued the Chinese to their ships,\n",
      "into which the Spaniards were able to shoot from the high banks. In\n",
      "this way they soon got control of the ships, which was necessary,\n",
      "because with these large ships they would easily have overcome our\n",
      "smaller vessel, and thus all hope to escape from the anger of the\n",
      "king would have been taken away from us. The king [15] was in great\n",
      "wrath. To send a message to him, and to carry a statement of the\n",
      "case, the father provincial, Fray Alonso Ximenez, was chosen. He\n",
      "went accompanied by half of the forces, the rest of us remaining in\n",
      "the ships. Several days were passed in sending messages backwards and\n",
      "forwards, but the king would not receive the ambassadors in person. It\n",
      "was plain that the king was planning to take all our lives. The demands\n",
      "which he made would have put us entirely in his power; and, when the\n",
      "father provincial asked permission to return and discuss them with the\n",
      "rest of the forces, the king refused permission for anyone to return\n",
      "except the father provincial alone. The intention of the king was to\n",
      "wait for a rainy day, so that our powder should be moistened and we\n",
      "be unable to use our arquebuses. When the father provincial came back,\n",
      "he asked me if I would venture to go to the camp, confess the soldiers\n",
      "and encourage them, and carry to the king our response declining to\n",
      "follow his wishes. When I reached the forces near the palace of the\n",
      "king, we did not consider the question of taking any answer to him,\n",
      "but discussed two plans of escape. One was to withdraw in good order,\n",
      "defending ourselves on the way; the other to attack the palace of\n",
      "the king by night and strive to capture him, his son, or his wife,\n",
      "whom we might use as hostages. Captain Diego Velloso declared that\n",
      "if we should attack these Indians boldly they would retreat to the\n",
      "mountains, and leave the field to us; but that if we should retreat\n",
      "they would all attack us. He had had experience in this part of the\n",
      "world, and what he said was confirmed by others, so that his plan was\n",
      "accepted. That night I confessed the men and told them what under the\n",
      "circumstances it was lawful for them to do, enjoining them to commit no\n",
      "unnecessary violence, and to take no lives except in self-defense. The\n",
      "attack was planned carefully, the troops being divided into a front\n",
      "and a rear guard, and some of the soldiers being left with a barge\n",
      "in the river near where we were encamped, with orders to capture\n",
      "two Indian boats as soon as they should hear the noise of conflict,\n",
      "so that we could make use of them in our retreat. I should have been\n",
      "glad to remain with the barge in order to avoid being present at\n",
      "the conflict, which promised to be sanguinary.] However, it seemed\n",
      "necessary for me to accompany the rest, and, armed as they were,\n",
      "and wearing no part of my habit except my scapular, I accompanied the\n",
      "troops who advanced against the palace. We were immediately detected,\n",
      "but succeeded in reaching the royal dwelling--which was built of wood,\n",
      "like the other houses in the town, but was very large. We broke in\n",
      "the doors, but the people all escaped through other doors; and thus,\n",
      "though we gained control of the palace, it was empty and we had failed\n",
      "in our purpose. I restrained the troops from burning the palace;\n",
      "but we lighted some bonfires, so that we might see each other. One\n",
      "of these saved my life, for as an Indian on an elephant was charging\n",
      "upon me and was already very close to me, so that I looked around\n",
      "at hearing the noise, the beast fled in alarm, being scared away\n",
      "by the fire. The Indians were not frightened by our daring, as we\n",
      "had falsely imagined that they would be, but gathered in a large\n",
      "square near the palace to face us. Everything, however, was noise\n",
      "and confusion among them, surprised as they were, and there was no\n",
      "less among us; for the number of our opponents was so much greater\n",
      "than theirs that, if darkness had not protected us, they could have\n",
      "buried us in handfuls of sand. [Like Joshua, I would have held back\n",
      "the dawn if I could. At daylight we were all in disorder. When the\n",
      "Indians could distinguish us from themselves and saw how few we were,\n",
      "they began to rain arrows upon us, several being wounded, Captain\n",
      "Diego Velloso having one leg pinned to another, so that he could not\n",
      "walk. Our troops were in entire confusion, some calling out that we\n",
      "ought to come to an understanding with the Indians, others finding\n",
      "fault with the plan that we had followed, until God was pleased to\n",
      "give me courage that I might give courage to the others, and I took\n",
      "upon myself the office of captain. Our last day, as we expected it\n",
      "to be, was bright and clear. A body of courageous Indians charged\n",
      "down the street at us, and their captain almost reached our line. I\n",
      "confess that I wished to leap out upon him, not that I might kill him,\n",
      "but that I might be the first to die, and not see the carnage which\n",
      "I feared--or the worse than carnage, if we were taken alive. But\n",
      "wisdom ruled me, and I ordered Captain Blas Ruiz to attack him with\n",
      "his halberd; with one blow he thrust the Indian through, shield and\n",
      "body. The death of their captain somewhat abated the courage of the\n",
      "rest. God was pleased that one of our bullets should strike the king,\n",
      "who was in the rear, unseen by us, animating his troops. We did not\n",
      "learn of this for some days afterward, but we could see that the\n",
      "Indians attacked us with less ardor. The Indians cut off our retreat\n",
      "to the barge, and we were obliged to leave the soldiers who were with\n",
      "it and to make our way, back by the road. As we marched along, we were\n",
      "obliged to defend ourselves on all sides, and especially against the\n",
      "crowd of Indians which followed in our rear. We could go but slowly,\n",
      "burdened as we were with our arms, and being obliged to carry our\n",
      "wounded.] Two arrows struck but did not wound me, one being caught by\n",
      "a coat of mail which I wore, and the other by my shield. We suffered\n",
      "greatly from hunger and thirst. When we came to some puddles with\n",
      "rain-water in them (which was more mud than water), all drank of them,\n",
      "and when I came there, though I was one of the last, I did the same;\n",
      "and though the best had already been drunk, and the rest was mixed\n",
      "with mud, it tasted better to me than any water that I ever drank in\n",
      "my life. Under all these circumstances, we marched on this day, which\n",
      "was the twelfth of May, four leguas by four o'clock in the afternoon,\n",
      "[when we were obliged to halt because we had reached the bank of a\n",
      "river. The Indians and we ourselves supposed that we should never\n",
      "be able to cross. Here some of our men urged that we ought to give\n",
      "ourselves up to the Indians as slaves for life; others declared that\n",
      "we ought to attack them, and force them to kill us. At nightfall, rain\n",
      "began; and the Indians, supposing that our powder would be moistened,\n",
      "prepared to attack us. I passed along the line, confessing some and\n",
      "encouraging all, though I must admit I was in great fear myself lest\n",
      "before midnight we should be cut into bits, that each one of our\n",
      "enemy might have his piece, as is the custom of Indians when they\n",
      "are victorious. The storm ceased before they dared to attack, but\n",
      "the river was still before us. There were two fords, one narrow and\n",
      "deep; the other, wide and shallow, and at about ten o'clock at night I\n",
      "decided that we ought to make the venture, and learn whether we were\n",
      "to live or die. We chose the longer and shallower ford, marching as\n",
      "quietly as we could, and leaving behind us a number of burning bits\n",
      "of the matches that we used for firing our guns, tied on the bushes,\n",
      "in order to make the Indians suppose that there was a large number\n",
      "of troops there. Our retreat was covered by six courageous men with\n",
      "two arquebuses each. When we entered the river, our vanguard, which\n",
      "was already in the middle, began to retreat upon us, fearing the\n",
      "people who were on the other bank, and their elephants, which they\n",
      "said they were driving into the water. I succeeded in reanimating\n",
      "them, and they fired a volley from the middle of the stream, where\n",
      "the water reached the beards of many of them. The enemy fled, and\n",
      "our passage was impeded only by the difficulty of dragging ourselves\n",
      "through the mud. We marched on for the rest of the night very slowly,\n",
      "with our clothes sticking to our bodies. On the morrow we found\n",
      "some fruit-trees and broke our fast of two nights and one day. We\n",
      "had great difficulty in carrying our wounded. One of the men being\n",
      "left behind by all, I had to carry him myself with his arms over my\n",
      "shoulders, for he was taller than I, until, after his wound began to\n",
      "grow feverish, he was able to walk a little himself. Not long before\n",
      "sunrise we reached the great river in which the ships were, but at a\n",
      "distance of two leguas from us. We put three of the wounded who were\n",
      "the hardest to carry into a little boat there, and ordered them to\n",
      "row down the river and carry the news of what had happened, and to\n",
      "direct the others to bring the ship near the bank where we were. In\n",
      "the meantime we cut some trees and made a breastwork; and when the\n",
      "Indians (who are not accustomed to attack by night) prepared to make\n",
      "their last rush and overwhelm us, our ship came up and, approaching\n",
      "the bank as closely as possible, played on the Indians with some\n",
      "artillery, and fired at them with arquebuses. Under this protection\n",

      "sea when the Indians reached the shore with the purpose of giving\n",
      "them this invitation. It was known that the kingdom of the Laos\n",
      "(to which the king of Camboja had withdrawn) was very near that of\n",
      "Cochinchina; and Captains Blas Ruyz and Diego Velloso asked permission\n",
      "to go by land and find the king. Gallinato permitted them to do so,\n",
      "and I accompanied them to the city of Sinoa, where a son of the king\n",
      "acted as viceroy. Some Augustinian friars who were in that country\n",
      "begged father Fray Alonso Ximenez to go with them and celebrate the\n",
      "feast of St. Augustine. During his absence, the rumor that the Indians\n",
      "intended to murder us treacherously kept increasing; so that we all\n",
      "went aboard, in order to be able to defend ourselves better. The time\n",
      "for sailing to Manila had come, of which we had to take advantage\n",
      "without waiting for either father Fray Alonso or the captain, because\n",
      "we should otherwise have been obliged to winter there. On the third\n",
      "of September, a multitude of people suddenly appeared on the hills,\n",
      "and a fleet came sailing up into the cove where we were. There were\n",
      "many galleys and small boats, and among them there were fifteen larger\n",
      "two-masted vessels, fastened together three by three, with no one on\n",
      "them but a steersman. These were loaded with wood and fagots, to set\n",
      "fire to us; while, if we took refuge in the water, the people in the\n",
      "small boats were ready to receive us. The men on the hills began to\n",
      "shoot at us with their arquebuses, which they used skilfully, aiming\n",
      "well, though they were slow in taking aim. The bullets, however,\n",
      "fell short. Our two smaller vessels set sail, and by the aid of a\n",
      "light breeze moved out into the middle of the bay. The ship in which\n",
      "I was was larger; and, though we tried to do as the other boats did,\n",
      "the wind was too light for us, and the fire-boats came upon us and\n",
      "gave us a great deal of trouble. They came so near that from the top\n",
      "of our poop we could see the steersmen, some of whom our men shot,\n",
      "while others took refuge in some little boats which they towed. When\n",
      "the fire-boats were left without anyone to steer them, they followed\n",
      "the current of the water, and left us in peace. At this point father\n",
      "Fray Alonso Ximenez reached the shore. They took off his habit and\n",
      "dragged him, with nothing on but his breeches, before the viceroy,\n",
      "who had come as general of this enterprise. He told him to put on his\n",
      "habit again, and talked of his ransom; but our captain was so angry\n",
      "at their treachery that he sent back a very wrathful answer. Thus\n",
      "father Fray Alonso Ximenez was left a prisoner, but was not ill\n",
      "treated. He received permission to live with the Augustinian fathers,\n",
      "and at last was permitted to go to Macan without being obliged to pay\n",
      "a ransom. From there he came back to this country at the end of a year\n",
      "and a half. On the next day we set sail for Manila. There are shoals in\n",
      "the midst of this gulf running for eighty leguas directly across the\n",
      "straight course for Manila; and to pass these shoals it was necessary\n",
      "to round one of the two ends of the chain--one in latitude nine, the\n",
      "other in latitude seventeen. The latter being nearer the direct line,\n",
      "we governed our course by it; and the flagship, sailing well against\n",
      "the wind, rounded it. The vessel in which I was, being a poor sailer,\n",
      "went by the other end, but got out of its course. We were becalmed\n",
      "one night, so near the coast of the Philippinas that the people were\n",
      "already beginning to prepare their clothes for going on shore. In the\n",
      "morning we found ourselves in the midst of reefs which were not on\n",
      "the charts. To make our way out from them, we were obliged to sail\n",
      "back on our course; and after we had made our way out the wind was\n",
      "against us, and we were obliged to sail toward the country which we\n",
      "had left. We decided to land at Malaca, that we might at least escape\n",
      "with our persons, for we cared little for anything else.] We reached\n",
      "an island named Pulotimon, [16] which is forty leguas from Malaca. The\n",
      "Indians here told us that there were some pirates in that sea; that\n",
      "they were anchored about five leguas off, and that we should have\n",
      "to pass them. This news greatly disquieted us, because our vessel\n",
      "did not sail well or answer the helm well, which is the worst thing\n",
      "that can be in a sea-fight. But it was not possible to escape this\n",
      "danger, because there was greater danger in every other direction\n",
      "where we wished to go. So we continued our voyage and met with the\n",
      "pirates, as they had told us. They had five ships, four of them small,\n",
      "and one of them large, strong, and well equipped, and provided with\n",
      "nettings. On these boats there were many little flags, which, we were\n",
      "told, were tokens of the prizes that they had taken. They were of a\n",
      "tribe called China-patan, descendants of Chinese who have colonized\n",
      "the kingdom of Patan. They had learned this business [of piracy],\n",
      "because it is easier than others; and they had now sailed out to\n",
      "practice it. That we might not show fear, but might excite fear in\n",
      "them, we passed close to their ships, with our flag flying and our\n",
      "drum beating. They failed to see that our invitation was feigned,\n",
      "accepted it, and, weighing their anchors, followed us all night, giving\n",
      "us chase till morning. The small vessels surrounded us, and with the\n",
      "large one attacked us. Their arms at close quarters were pikes and\n",
      "javelins with points hardened in the fire [tostadas]. The arms which\n",
      "they used at a distance were culverins and arquebuses. In using our\n",
      "arquebuses we did not waste a bullet, for there were many on whom to\n",
      "employ them. [We were alarmed by the explosion of a keg of powder, but\n",
      "fortunately only one man was killed. I was standing alone on the poop,\n",
      "watching for the result of the fight; and at first the enemy did not\n",
      "notice me, since the waist was full of their pikemen. At last, one of\n",
      "them perceived me and flung a pike at me, giving me a wound of three\n",
      "dedos in depth. I descended from the poop; but, before I reached the\n",
      "deck, one of the fire-hardened lances struck me in the right jaw,\n",
      "leaving its point and innumerable splinters in the flesh. With my\n",
      "two hands upon my two wounds I went to confess some wounded men\n",
      "who were in danger. At last when the enemies saw that their prize\n",
      "cost them much, they left us and went away without our being able to\n",
      "follow them, because our vessel was so unfit. We afterward learned in\n",
      "Malaca that out of two hundred pirates (which was their total number)\n",
      "more than half had been killed. Most of us were wounded, and two or\n",
      "three died--besides two others, who were shot by accident by their\n",
      "own friends. After we had escaped this danger we came, two days later,\n",
      "upon a surprise which was equally great. In the strait of Sincapura,\n",
      "by which we were obliged to pass, we found a fleet of eighty large\n",
      "galleys, with heavy artillery amidships and along the sides. This\n",
      "was the fleet of the king of Achen, who was going to do what injury\n",
      "he could to the king of Jor [i.e., Johor] to whom belongs the country\n",
      "of that strait. The latter had sixteen galleys for its defense, which\n",
      "were in the mouths of the rivers to prevent his enemy from entering\n",
      "them. Malaca is between these two kingdoms. There was at that time an\n",
      "agreement that neither of these kings should be assisted with men,\n",
      "but only with provisions and ammunition, one side receiving the\n",
      "one and the other the other, but neither receiving both. We passed\n",
      "ourselves off to them as Portuguese; and when they called upon us to\n",
      "enter their galleys we excused ourselves, because of the aforesaid\n",
      "agreement, and went on in peace to Malaca. I went to our convent,\n",
      "where the religious were surprised at my coming, partly because it\n",
      "was the middle of November, when they did not expect a vessel from\n",
      "any direction, and partly because they saw me in so coarse a habit,\n",
      "very different from that which they wore. Besides that, I was very\n",
      "dirty and very lean, and had my body and face all bound up because\n",
      "of my wounds. Although my appearance was so strange, they were so\n",
      "discreet (or I had better say so charitable) that, without asking any\n",
      "questions they arranged to take care of me, called in the surgeon,\n",
      "and brought me underwear and a habit after their fashion. After I\n",
      "was cared for and clothed, they asked me whence I came and how I had\n",
      "been brought there. I was charmed with the kindness which they had\n",
      "shown me, and told of my wanderings and of the sufferings which I had\n",
      "endured, by which they were greatly astonished. I remained there for\n",
      "six months. My cure took three months, and from the wound in my face\n",
      "every day two or three splinters were discharged, some larger and\n",
      "others smaller, until at least a hundred had come out. Though the\n",
      "wound closed, two remained within, which came out two years later,\n",
      "two dedos below the wound. I was much inconvenienced during those\n",
      "three months, because I could only open my mouth a little way; and\n",
      "hence it was very painful for me to eat until, by exercise, my jaw\n",
      "came back to its former usefulness. Of the soldiers who came with me,\n",
      "some went to India and twelve to Camboxa, supposing that the rightful\n",
      "king was now probably there. They found on the throne his son,\n",
      "who with a great army given him by the king of the Laos, and with\n",
      "the captains of whom I have spoken, had returned to his kingdom of\n",
      "Camboxa and pacified it. Here they remained for a considerable time,\n",
      "though they were disappointed in everything. I and the others returned\n",
      "to Manila. The voyage is one of five hundred leguas, and it took us\n",
      "fifty days because of the many calms.] One calm night, when there\n",
      "was no one at the helm, the binnacle, or three-wicked candle which\n",
      "lights up the compass, fell down from the quarterdeck; and the flame\n",
      "instantly burst out through a hatchway which was over it, frightening\n",
      "all of us--for there is nothing more dreadful at sea than fire, for\n",
      "everything in a ship is like tinder. In this ship, although it was\n",
      "small, there were more than three hundred slaves, men and women. All of\n",
      "them raised their cries to heaven. The captain, whose duty it was to\n",
      "encourage them, immediately fell on his knees to make his confession,\n",
      "as if things had already gone beyond remedy, but I pushed him away a\n",
      "pace and a half, saying that it was not time for that yet, and that\n",
      "he ought to look out for the fire first. I am almost certain that if\n",
      "he had been permitted to confess to me we should all have burned to\n",
      "death, because, however little our safety might have been delayed\n",
      "by confessions, there would have been no remedy afterwards. We put\n",
      "all the clothes there were there into the water, to soak them, and\n",
      "then threw them down the hatchway, one on top of another. In this way\n",
      "God was pleased that the fire should be put out; and we were left as\n",
      "much amazed by this sudden and dangerous accident as people are who\n",
      "are waked out of their sleep by a beam of light falling on them. We\n",
      "at last reached Manila by St. John's day at the end of a year and a\n",
      "half of this tedious and painful journeying. Soon after, father Fray\n",
      "Alonso Ximenez arrived by way of Macan from Cochinchina, where he had\n",
      "remained a prisoner. After all our hardships, afflictions, dangers,\n",
      "and wounds, we brought back no other fruit but that of having suffered\n",
      "for the gospel. Our only intention was to go to preach in that kingdom,\n",
      "having been invited by its king, and influenced by his promises to that\n",
      "end. These were great, though he was unable to fulfil them, since he\n",
      "had been despoiled of his kingdom when we reached it, as has been said.\n",

      "CHAPTER XLIX\n",
      "\n",
      "The election as provincial of father Fray Bernardo de Sancta Catharina\n",
      "or Navarro, and the churches which were incorporated in the province\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On the fifteenth of June, 1596, the fathers assembled in the convent\n",
      "of Manila to elect a provincial, because father Fray Alonso Ximenez\n",
      "had finished his term. The definitors (who, as they afterward were\n",
      "to confirm the provincial, were elected first) were: father Fray\n",
      "Diego de Soria, second time prior of the said convent; father Fray\n",
      "Bartholome de Nieva, a religious of very superior virtue, as will be\n",
      "narrated in due time; father Fray Juan de Sancto Thomas, or Ormaca;\n",
      "and father Fray Juan Garcia--all persons of conspicuous devotion to\n",
      "their religious duties, and of noble example. Several times they\n",
      "cast votes for the provincial without result. Because there were\n",
      "many who deserved the office, and because the votes were divided\n",
      "among them, no one had the number necessary for election. Those who\n",
      "had the largest number of votes were father Fray Diego de Soria and\n",
      "father Fray Juan de Sancto Thomas. These same persons endeavored to\n",
      "persuade everyone to vote for father Fray Bernardo de Sancta Catharina,\n",
      "who was accordingly elected. The election was a very satisfactory\n",
      "one, for, in addition to being a very holy man, he was very wise\n",
      "and learned, and most devoted to the ministry and preaching of the\n",
      "holy gospel--in which, and in patience, and in the endurance of the\n",
      "most severe hardships which befell him for this cause, no one ever\n",
      "surpassed him, and he surpassed many. During his time he had seen\n",
      "the province greatly favored by the Lord, by a very great spread of\n",
      "the Christian faith among the Indians who were under his care. Many\n",
      "of them in the villages where there were religious were baptized;\n",
      "and, where there were no religious, they were desirous and eager\n",
      "to receive baptism. Accordingly, at this chapter not only were new\n",
      "churches admitted which had been built in the towns where there were\n",
      "already religious--as, among the Chinese, the church of San Gabriel\n",
      "at Minondoc; and, in Bataan, the church in the village of Samal,\n",
      "besides others--but it also seemed good to admit heathen villages,\n",
      "although they had no religious, and there were none in the province so\n",
      "that teachers could be provided for them. Yet in this way they strove\n",
      "to comfort those who asked and desired them, and raised in them the\n",
      "hope that in this way they would receive religious when they came from\n",
      "Espana. Thus were received the church of San Vicente of the village\n",
      "of Buguey, afterward called Sancta Anna; Sancta Catarina of Nasiping,\n",
      "afterward called San Miguel; and others like them--to which, in the\n",
      "course of time, religious were sent when they came to the islands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon after this provincial chapter had come to an end, another\n",
      "shipload of religious arrived from Espana. They had been gathered\n",
      "with great care and diligence by the new bishop of Nueva Segovia,\n",
      "Don Fray Miguel de Venavides, whose new dignity had not sufficed to\n",
      "diminish the love which he felt for his associates. He gave to this\n",
      "matter more than ordinary attention, because he knew how greatly\n",
      "needed were good workmen to aid in the great harvest which the Lord\n",
      "had placed in their hands, ready to be gathered by the means of\n",
      "baptism into this church militant, that the faithful might pass from\n",
      "it to the church triumphant. The Indians themselves asked to have\n",
      "preachers sent to their villages, and were grieved that these could\n",
      "not be given to them. This not a little afflicted the religious, who\n",
      "desired to satisfy them by the fulfilment of their just desires, but\n",
      "were unable to do so on account of their own small number--too small\n",
      "even for that which they had undertaken, and much more to go to the\n",
      "aid of new regions. Besides this, the careful bishop was influenced\n",
      "by the need of his own sheep; for nearly everything to which we\n",
      "ministered fell within the bishopric of Nueva Segovia, which was\n",
      "under his direction. Accordingly, taking advantage of his authority\n",
      "as a bishop, and of the reputation which he had as a learned and holy\n",
      "religious, he gathered the second shipload, and afterward the third\n",
      "(with which he came). Father Fray Pedro de Ledesma [17] happened\n",
      "to be in Castilla when the shipload which the good bishop sent was\n",
      "about to sail. His presence was very convenient for his superior,\n",
      "because he was an old and venerable father who had been many years\n",
      "in the Indias in the very religious province of Guatimala, and who\n",
      "therefore knew what was needed for the voyage. He was also of a very\n",
      "gentle disposition, which is of great importance for such purposes\n",
      "as his. The bishop laid upon this father the charge of conducting\n",
      "the religious who had been gathered for this province; and he, being\n",
      "inclined to all good, readily accepted the office, although he knew\n",
      "that it was a very troublesome one. It not only required him to go\n",
      "on business to the office of accounts--and, to him who knows what\n",
      "that is, it is not necessary to say anything more--but he had also\n",
      "to keep in contentment many religious who, as it was the first time\n",
      "when they were at sea, were seasick, miserable, and very much in need\n",
      "of someone to comfort them, bear with them, and encourage them. For\n",
      "all this father Fray Pedro was very well suited, and conducted them\n",
      "as comfortably as possible through the two long voyages which have\n",
      "to be made on the way from Espana here. He did not shrink from the\n",
      "great labor which this duty brought with it, that he might serve the\n",
      "Lord, and aid in the preaching of His gospel and in the conversion of\n",
      "these heathen. They arrived in the month of July in this year of 1596,\n",
      "and were received with great joy; and with them those missions which\n",
      "were in need of religious were strengthened.\n",
      "\n",
      "Captains Blas Ruiz de Fernan Goncalez and Diego Velloso, who (as\n",
      "has been stated in the preceding chapter) went from Cochinchina to\n",
      "the kingdom of the Laos to look for the king of Camboja, met with\n",
      "success. They found his son (for the king was already dead), and\n",
      "told him all that the Spaniards had already done to help him, and how\n",
      "they had slain the tyrant who had undertaken to establish himself in\n",
      "the kingdom and had usurped it. They told him that they had come to\n",
      "seek him that they might put him in quiet possession of his kingdom,\n",
      "and other things of this kind, and roused his courage so that he put\n",
      "himself in their hands. Depending upon them, he returned to Camboja\n",
      "with a tolerably large army, which the king of the Laos gave him; and\n",
      "the Spaniards fulfilled their word and established him in his royal\n",
      "throne and palace, causing the largest and best part of the kingdom\n",
      "to be obedient to him. The king in reward of services so faithful\n",
      "and useful gave them lands and vassals in his kingdom. To Blas Ruiz\n",
      "he gave the province of Tran; to Diego Velloso that of Bapano, with\n",
      "titles very honorable in this kingdom. The two captains in their\n",
      "new favor did not forget God, to whom they had so especial reasons\n",
      "to be thankful; or their natural king and lord, from whom also they\n",
      "had received rewards. They informed the king of Camboja of the great\n",
      "good that it would be to his kingdom to know and reverence God by\n",
      "entering into His service through holy baptism, and to have the king\n",
      "of Espana for his friend. For the first purpose, father Fray Alonso\n",
      "Ximenez and myself were proposed. They urged the great devotion,\n",
      "virtue, and prudence of the holy old man, and the many sufferings\n",
      "which we had both undergone from favoring the king's own cause; and\n",
      "they said that, if he sent to call us back, we would very readily\n",
      "come to preach the holy gospel. As for the second purpose they said\n",
      "that he ought to send an embassy to the governor of Manila; and, as\n",
      "a sign of the beginning of this friendship, that he ought to ask for\n",
      "some soldiers, by whose aid he might easily complete the pacification\n",
      "of his country. The king assented to all this, and sent his embassy\n",
      "with letters to the governor, telling him that his principal reason\n",
      "for asking for soldiers was that his vassals might be baptized with\n",
      "greater certainty and less difficulty. To father Fray Alonso Ximenez\n",
      "he wrote another letter, in the language and characters which those\n",
      "people use, and sealed with his royal seal, of a red color. In the\n",
      "Castilian language its tenor was as follows: [\"Prauncar, king of\n",
      "Camboja, to father Fray Alonso Ximenez of the Order of St. Dominic:\n",
      "Greeting. From what I have heard from the captain Chofa Don Blas\n",
      "Ruiz of Castilla, and from the captain Chofa Don Diego of Portugal,\n",
      "with regard to the conduct of father Fray Alonso Ximenez when the\n",
      "Spaniards slew Anacaparan, I have conceived a great affection for\n",
      "father Fray Alonso Ximenez. Now that I am in my kingdom I beg father\n",
      "Fray Alonso Ximenez to come to it, and to bring with him father Fray\n",
      "Diego. I promise to build them churches and convents, and to give\n",
      "permission to all in my kingdom to become Christians. Though I have\n",
      "shown the two chofas [18] great favor and wish to keep them in my\n",
      "kingdom, they are unwilling to stay, because there are no religious\n",
      "here.\" The two captains wrote in the same strain to the fathers,\n",
      "begging them to come and reunite this kingdom with the Church.\n",
      "\n",
      "The governor of Manila saw how much could be done for the service of\n",
      "the king by sending the soldiers for whom the king of Camboja asked;\n",
      "but they were in such need of men and money that they could not well\n",
      "meet his desires. For this reason, a knight of the Habit of Calatraba\n",
      "who had been governor of these islands, by name Don Luis Perez das\n",
      "Marinas, promised to pay the expenses of the expedition from his own\n",
      "fortune. The enterprise thus being made possible, we two religious\n",
      "of the order for whom the king of Camboja asked were obliged to go;\n",

      "much beloved by Don Luis. There were equipped for the expedition two\n",
      "vessels of Spanish build, of moderate tonnage, and a galleot. The\n",
      "preparations were made (as preparations usually are made by the\n",
      "hand of servants of the king) slowly and faultily, as was seen by\n",
      "the results. We did not set out for some months, and our ships were\n",
      "so badly equipped and so weak that they began to leak as soon as the\n",
      "voyage began--a forewarning of the evils that we afterwards suffered,\n",
      "in which the poor knight Don Luis was disappointed, while all of us\n",
      "who accompanied him paid for the inadequacy of the preparation. [19]\n",
      "Since we were so late, the pilots decided to follow the course by\n",
      "the gulf of Haynau to go round the shoals by the end in latitude\n",
      "seventeen, because in that way the wind would be favorable; while if\n",
      "they rounded the end in latitude nine, which was the regular course,\n",
      "the wind would be adverse. They left Manila September 17 [1598], with\n",
      "one hundred and fifty soldiers and sailors. In the flagship Don Luis,\n",
      "who went as commander, took with him father Fray Alonso Ximenez and\n",
      "the two Franciscan fathers. He directed me to go in the ship of the\n",
      "second in command, [20] giving that officer orders to govern himself\n",
      "by my advice. Within six days the vessels were scattered in the storm\n",
      "and were all lost, no one knowing anything of the rest, and each one\n",
      "supposing that the others were continuing their voyage in safety. The\n",
      "galleot met with the best fortune, for, although damaged, it reached a\n",
      "friendly port, was repaired, and continued its journey. The flagship\n",
      "was obliged to cut away the mainmast, and sailing under its foresail,\n",
      "ran aground in China on the eve of St. Francis. All who were on board\n",
      "had to save themselves by swimming, and lost even their clothes. In\n",
      "the ship of the second in command, in which I was, the mainmast broke\n",
      "close to the deck, fortunately falling over the side so as not to\n",
      "injure the vessel or to kill any of the men. The mizzenmast, being\n",
      "badly wedged, began to topple, and had to be cut away. We sailed\n",
      "on under the foresail, hoping to reach a port. But the fury of the\n",
      "tempest and the force of the waves were such as to break the gudgeons\n",
      "of the rudder. Some of our men flung themselves into the sea after\n",
      "it and brought it back, but it was lost again; and we steered the\n",
      "vessel with two long spars fastened to the side of the boat with a\n",
      "cable. The ship was so strained that the boards on the sides began to\n",
      "play up and down like organ-keys; but we threw cables about her, and\n",
      "drew them taut with arquebuses. Then the bow began to work loose, from\n",
      "the weight of the foremast and bowsprit, and we were forced to bind it\n",
      "firmly with cables to the poop. All that we could do against the storm\n",
      "and the wind was like the strength of a child exerted to restrain the\n",
      "fury of a mad bull. In fear of another storm, we took refuge upon an\n",
      "island which we encountered, one of the group called the Babuyanes. We\n",
      "found a harbor, ran the bow ashore, and dropped two anchors from the\n",
      "poop. We put the ammunition and the provisions that we had on shore;\n",
      "and had hardly begun to dry our clothes, on the eve of St. Francis,\n",
      "when the storm broke upon us with such violence that it seemed to me to\n",
      "try to swallow us. The ship was broken in pieces; but the keel, and the\n",
      "artillery which was carried as ballast, being too heavy for the deck,\n",
      "were buried in the sand. We protected ourselves from the storm--which\n",
      "lasted two days, and was one of both wind and rain--in some huts, which\n",
      "we built on the beach of branches.] After the storm was over we dug up\n",
      "the artillery, which consisted of four medium-sized cannon, mounted,\n",
      "and set them up in a little fort which we made of logs, because there\n",
      "were many Indians on the islands, and we did not know whether they\n",
      "were friends or enemies. In a short time many of them appeared in a\n",
      "troop on the shore, with their weapons. These consisted of two lances,\n",
      "one for hurling, and the other large like a pike, with iron points;\n",
      "both were made of ebony, of which there is much here. For defensive\n",
      "armor they had sheets of the bark of trees, resembling cork. We sent\n",
      "to them a man as a hostage and mark of peace, and they made signs to\n",
      "him from a distance to put down his arms. He laid them at one side\n",
      "and went to the Indians; and then they sent to us one of their own\n",
      "number, whom we treated kindly, and after giving him some trinkets,\n",
      "sent him back to his comrades; agreeing with him that they should\n",
      "bring us provisions at a just price. They did this for two days,\n",
      "although very scantily; and on the third day they broke the peace\n",
      "by killing one of our Japanese, and badly wounding another who had\n",
      "come in our company. He came back with his arm pierced, and with a\n",
      "wound a span long above the pit of his stomach, but not entering it;\n",
      "but he was very well satisfied because, by throwing himself forward\n",
      "by the pike, he had killed the Indian who had wounded him--so proud\n",
      "is that race. Now that our supplies were cut off, we were obliged,\n",
      "since food is necessary, to take it by force, where we could find it,\n",
      "since they would not sell it willingly; so for several mornings a\n",
      "troop of our Indians went out under escort of our soldiers, gathered\n",
      "what they could from the fields, and brought it back as food for\n",
      "all. At one time when they were engaged in this, they thought that\n",
      "they had discovered a great treasure; for they found some jars of\n",
      "moderate size covered by others of similar size. Inside they found\n",
      "some dead bodies dried, and nothing else. In that shipwreck we had\n",
      "had the good luck to bring the boat ashore, and thus to save it. This\n",
      "we intended to make use of by sending it to ask for aid from Nueva\n",
      "Segovia, which was only twenty leguas distant. In order to do this,\n",
      "it was necessary to lengthen the keel a braza, and to raise the sides\n",
      "about half a vara. Both these things were done, though there was no\n",
      "one among us who understood more carpentry than that best teacher,\n",
      "Necessity, had taught them. We all thought that it was best that the\n",
      "pilot and two men and I should go in it, because they believed that,\n",
      "if I went, more effectual aid would be sent. We did so, and then,\n",
      "when we sailed around the island we gave thanks to the Lord for His\n",
      "kindness in having brought us to this little bay; for on any of the\n",
      "other sides of the island we should certainly have been drowned in\n",
      "the ocean, or, if any of us had escaped, should have perished at\n",
      "the hands of the Indians. The Lord gave us a favorable wind, which\n",
      "was needed by our tiny boat in that rough ocean, and we reached the\n",
      "river of Nueva Segovia, which is very large; the distance from the\n",
      "mouth to the city is three leguas. The alcalde-mayor immediately set\n",
      "about the rescue, appropriated two fragatas, and had them prepared\n",
      "to go to our people who were in the islands. At the same time I wrote\n",
      "to Manila to the agents of Don Luys to send a ship, ship-stores, and\n",
      "everything else required for continuing the voyage. I also wrote to my\n",
      "superior, giving him an account of what had happened. The answer to my\n",
      "letters was made plain, both on the island and in Manila. The governor\n",
      "commanded that the voyage should be continued, all of the expenditure\n",
      "being made anew, while my superior directed me to return to Manila;\n",
      "and so I did, although my companions were greatly grieved. In truth,\n",
      "by failing to go with them I caused their destruction; because, as they\n",
      "were sailing toward the coast of China, they saw a Chinese ship, and,\n",
      "against the will of the pilot and some few others, the rest determined\n",
      "to pursue and plunder it. The ship fled, turning toward the coast of\n",
      "its own country, which was all sown with shallows, well known to them\n",
      "but not to our men. So eagerly did the Spaniards chase after them\n",
      "in their greed for the prize, which they now regarded as certain,\n",
      "that our ship ran aground and broke into two parts. The men were all\n",
      "thrown into the sea, where some of them were drowned immediately,\n",
      "and others, who took refuge on shoals, were drowned when the tide came\n",
      "in. Some few only escaped, with the pilot, in a raft which they made of\n",
      "planks from the ship. Even of those few some died of the cold, which\n",
      "was very great, and was still more severe for them because they were\n",
      "all wet. At last those who escaped reached the coast, with difficulty\n",
      "enough. They were seized by the Chinese, and carried about for many\n",
      "leguas from one judge to another. In this way they learned that Don\n",
      "Luis was on the same coast, and that he had been wrecked on the same\n",
      "day of St. Francis, and at the same time with us. They learned that\n",
      "he was twenty leguas from there, on an island called Lampacao. They\n",
      "received permission to join him; and in spite of their miseries they\n",
      "forgot their ills in their pity for the poor knight and his men,\n",
      "who kept themselves alive with shellfish, which they found there\n",
      "and ate in small quantities. They all suffered patiently, because\n",
      "of the example of their commander--who, that he might not offend\n",
      "[the people of] the land, never allowed his men to ask for anything,\n",
      "even what necessity almost compelled them to request.\n",

      "superior notified me that I should go to take the relief to Don Luis,\n",

      "up so that it would stand any storm--having taken warning from the\n",
      "previous ships, which had proved deficient in the first storm that\n",
      "came upon us. By such diligence, we set sail, with suitable relief,\n",
      "on September six. Arriving with it in less than twenty days, we were as\n",
      "well received, as we were so heartily desired. We also found bad news\n",
      "from Camboja, which had been brought by some ships that had returned\n",
      "from that country. That news was that all the Spaniards there--both\n",
      "those of our galliot, and all the others--had perished at the hands\n",
      "of the Indians themselves, because of quarrelsome persons among\n",
      "them, who were intolerable to the natives. Since it was impossible\n",
      "to go thither as friends, and since our forces were very few to go\n",
      "in any other manner, consequently, a general council having been\n",
      "held, it resulted that we should return to Manila. To carry that\n",
      "into effect, it was necessary to go to the court of the viceroy at\n",
      "Canton to get permission, for we could not leave his port without\n",
      "it. It was determined that I should go to get the permission. I was\n",
      "accompanied by two soldiers and an Indian up a large river with most\n",
      "beautiful and refreshing banks, which contained some very densely\n",
      "populated villages. Arrived at Canton, we were lodged in a house\n",
      "in the suburbs, as foreigners were not allowed to live in the city,\n",
      "nor even to enter it without express permission from the judge who is\n",
      "in charge. Guards are stationed for that reason at all the gates, so\n",
      "that they may refuse admittance without such permission. It happened\n",
      "that there was a eunuch of the king there at that time, as inspector\n",
      "of that province. Within his palace the king of China is served only\n",
      "by eunuchs, and many are castrated, in order to be eligible to serve\n",
      "the king; and as they alone have access to his person and ear, they\n",
      "persuade him of whatever they wish, and derive immense bribes from\n",
      "the judges throughout the kingdom. The latter give them the bribes,\n",
      "so that the inspectors may hand in a good report of them. That year\n",
      "the eunuchs got for themselves the inspection of the provinces of that\n",
      "kingdom, as a great harvest was offered therefrom, not only to the king\n",
      "but also to the others who remained at his side in order to perpetuate\n",
      "their acts of injustice with security, the gates to the complaints\n",
      "that could have been uttered against them having been closed. Then\n",
      "was it my unhappy lot that I should fall into the hands of one of\n",
      "them, called Liculifu, who had charge of the visit to Canton, and\n",
      "who, under pretext of the visit, was making haste to impoverish the\n",
      "country and the inhabitants; for his charge there also comprehended\n",
      "the inspection of a pearl-fishery for the king in the gulf of Haynao,\n",
      "which was situated about one hundred leguas farther along the coast. It\n",
      "was said that he had borrowed one thousand ships for that purpose,\n",
      "and that he was in haste; but that he wanted first what fish he\n",
      "could get on land--for which he had innumerable parasites at his\n",
      "side who were wont to seek out means by which, rightly or wrongly,\n",
      "he could employ them, by which they were always the gainers; and who,\n",
      "in addition, always flattered him by showing him such means of gain,\n",
      "by which he considered himself as well served, and rewarded those\n",
      "most who were most advantaged by it. Certain of those creatures,\n",
      "ferreting us out, immediately went to denounce us, not as evildoers,\n",
      "but as men absolutely rolling in silver; for that is their opinion\n",
      "of the Spaniards, even though they see them going naked. Therefore,\n",
      "it suited him to employ his greed on us, although asking silver from\n",
      "us was equivalent to asking pears from the elm tree. The inspector,\n",
      "believing that we had maliciously concealed the silver, tried to get\n",
      "it by force; but instead of silver he drew blood. Acting upon that\n",
      "information he had us summoned before him, a day or two after our\n",
      "arrival. We entered the gate used by foreigners, and there is only\n",
      "one such gate. The guards registered us there, so carefully do they\n",
      "watch and guard their city, although so rare are the foreigners who\n",
      "enter it. We approached the inspector's court, but before we entered\n",
      "it I had the inspector notified, by an interpreter whom I had with\n",
      "me, that I would not kneel before him, as such was not the custom of\n",
      "Castilians--whether religious or captains--even were it before the\n",
      "kings of that land. He had me told that I should do so, but I answered\n",
      "to the contrary twice more. However, finally paying greater heed to\n",
      "the advantage that he expected [to derive], than to his honor and\n",
      "courtesy which he claimed, he had me told that the soldiers should\n",
      "kneel and that I should make him the bow and reverence that I was\n",
      "wont to make to my king. Thereupon we entered, and found him seated\n",
      "in great state at his desk, on which were the instruments used in\n",
      "writing, according to their usage. Many servants stood near him, in a\n",
      "chapel-like place that faced a large open court, whence those having\n",
      "business entered as he summoned them. Placed on their knees between\n",
      "two rows of executioners with frightful visages--twelve to the side,\n",
      "who stood there--their cases were disposed of, and they were punished\n",
      "there immediately, as soon as he ordered it, without further appeal\n",
      "or recourse. The soldiers and the interpreter knelt before them,\n",
      "while I remained upright, after having made him a very deep bow. He\n",
      "received us well, and addressed some pleasant words to us. I thanked\n",
      "him heartily, and made him a present of a piece of scarlet cloth\n",
      "and a large and excellent mirror, with its silver chain by which to\n",
      "hang it up, which had been given me for that purpose by General Don\n",
      "Luis. The latter already was aware that no business was transacted\n",
      "without a present. The inspector received the present very gladly,\n",
      "as it consisted of articles that were scarce in that country. He\n",
      "expressed many scruples in regard to it, so that it might not appear\n",
      "that he was receiving it as a bribe, and said that it would be taken\n",
      "as part payment of the duties due and to be paid by the ships; and that\n",
      "he had a conscience and kept his gaze on the heavens, so that he might\n",
      "not commit any unjust act. But in truth, although I thought that he\n",
      "would be satisfied with that present, he regarded it as the beginning\n",
      "of what we had to give and waited for the rest. I asked him to send\n",
      "someone to measure the ships and receive the duties, for it was now\n",
      "time for us to leave. He did so immediately, and sent officials like\n",
      "himself. Those officials declared, because they were not bribed at\n",
      "the beginning, that the duties amounted to one thousand eight hundred\n",
      "ducados. Don Luis, having been advised of what ought to be done,\n",
      "asked that the measurements be made a second time; and after he had\n",
      "given them their bribe, they took off the thousand ducados, and the\n",
      "duties remained at only eight hundred. Believing that the inspector's\n",
      "greed was satisfied, I delayed two or three days in going to see him;\n",
      "but he, as his appetite had been whetted for the desire of more with\n",
      "the taste that he had received, took my delay very ill, and had only\n",
      "the two soldiers and the interpreter summoned, but ordered me not to go\n",
      "to him. On seeing them, he broke out into great anger because they had\n",
      "not treated him according to his dignity. He ordered the interpreter\n",
      "to be beaten as the most guilty, since, knowing the custom of the\n",
      "country, he had not advised us thereof. They actually administered\n",
      "five blows to him, and the blows that they give are always few, but\n",
      "very severe. Those blows accordingly formed great wounds on the upper\n",
      "part of his legs, that being where they are administered. He ordered\n",
      "the soldiers to be all but lashed. They were thrown to the ground,\n",
      "and their legs bared, while the executioner stood near them with his\n",
      "lash raised. That instrument is made from a very large bamboo (such\n",
      "as grow there), split in two and weighted somewhat with lead, and\n",
      "having many slits, whose edges cut like knives. And as the executioner\n",
      "stood thus, waiting for the order to strike the blow, he ordered him\n",
      "to stay his hand, being satisfied to see them thus fearful. Then\n",
      "he ordered all three to be taken prisoners to a public prison,\n",
      "which was located at a considerable distance from his house. While\n",
      "on the way thither they had me summoned, and bribed the officials\n",
      "to stop in an idol temple. I went there alone, although with great\n",
      "difficulty. They implored me again and again not to leave them in\n",
      "custody, for they would die in prison. I promised them not to leave\n",
      "that place until they were liberated, or else I would share the same\n",
      "fortune with them. I well understood that those blows were directed\n",
      "at me, rather than at them; and that, although given to others,\n",
      "were a threat to me so that I should tremble and give the inspector\n",
      "what he desired, or he would cause me also to suffer such things,\n",
      "or even greater. I knew already that his parasites had informed him\n",
      "of the esteem in which the Spanish hold their priests and religious,\n",
      "and that they would redeem by weight of silver whatever insult he\n",
      "might try to inflict on me; and that if he wished to fill his hand\n",
      "well, he should make what extortions from me his tyrannous and greedy\n",
      "taste dictated. I had no silver to satisfy his desire, nor, even had\n",
      "I desired to supply that lack by any efforts, did I have any method\n",
      "or means to do so. It even cost me very dearly to enter the city,\n",
      "and I could not go on that account. I was persecuted by children, who\n",
      "accosted me as did the children of Bethel the holy prophet Elisha;\n",
      "while not one of the men had compassion on me, for they do not know\n",
      "what compassion means toward their own countrymen, however afflicted\n",
      "they see them to be. And further, if they behold them persecuted by\n",
      "the more influential men, then in such case they flee from the sight\n",
      "of them, in fear lest they receive a portion of the punishment, as\n",
      "being accomplices in the guilt. The soldiers, as they were afflicted,\n",
      "attributed the slowness of the relief to my neglect, and the inspector\n",
      "to obstinacy. Finally he endeavored to satisfy his greed by making\n",
      "open proof of my patience. Therefore, he summoned me on All Saints'\n",
      "day. I heard of his resolve some days beforehand, and prepared for it\n",
      "by saying mass--for which I had the opportunity, as the Portuguese\n",
      "from Macan happened to be there at that time, by virtue of their\n",
      "ordinary permission to go to Canton twice each year, to purchase\n",
      "the articles that they need in certain fairs which are held there\n",
      "at that time. However, they are not permitted to live in the city,\n",
      "but must remain in their own boats in the river. As that purchasing\n",
      "(which lasts many days) is a matter of consequence, the Portuguese\n",
      "bring a priest, who says mass to them, in a little house near the\n",
      "river. At that time there were three fathers of the Society there,\n",
      "one of whom was acting in the capacity of chaplain for the traders,\n",
      "while the other two were about to enter the interior with Father Matheo\n",
      "Riccio, who had lived there for years. One of those two fathers, one\n",
      "Lacaro Catanio, had lived with the above father for some years; and,\n",
      "having gone to Macan on business, was then returning with another\n",
      "Spaniard named Diego Pantoja. Both of them dressed themselves,\n",
      "on the afternoon of the eve of All Saints, in Chinese habits, in\n",
      "order to make their journey with some guides that they had with\n",
      "them. Father Lacaro Catanio, as he had been a long time in China,\n",
      "had long hair and beard, but the other father, having only recently\n",
      "arrived, did not; and consequently he was in some danger, as he did\n",
      "not follow the customs of the country in everything. By way, then,\n",
      "of those fathers I was enabled to say mass. Scarcely had I concluded\n",
      "it, when I was accosted by an official of the inspector, with his\n",
      "chapa (or summons) to take me before the inspector. I went thither,\n",
      "and found him in his courtroom, as at the first time. Although I\n",
      "intended to show him the same courtesy as the first time, he made me\n",
      "kneel down, besides going between those two files of executioners, who\n",
      "appeared to me like demons. The inspector began then to shout at me,\n",
      "in his treble voice, and poured forth a torrent of words, which were\n",
      "explained to me by a Chinese who understood some Portuguese. He charged\n",
      "me in his speech with being a spy, as I had not observed my duty. At\n",
      "the end of the speech came his deeds. At the inspector's order one\n",
      "of those executioners threw me to the ground, and, baring my legs,\n",
      "raised himself in a position to lash me. While in that position,\n",
      "the inspector repeated many times his assertion that I must be a\n",
      "spy. Thereupon I drew a report from my bosom that I brought from\n",
      "the Chinese who were living in Manila, both Christians and heathens,\n",
      "which told of the great good that the members of my order had done\n",
      "there to all of their nation--how we cared for their sick, supported\n",
      "the poor, and defended them all from injuries which were attempted\n",
      "against them. It was written in their own characters, on a sheet of\n",
      "paper one braza long, and was folded within a covering, also made of\n",
      "paper, after their manner and custom. I had come prepared with that\n",
      "for whatever might happen, and accordingly I presented it at that so\n",
      "pressing moment. The inspector read it, while I was kept stretched out\n",
      "and bared ready for the lash, and the executioner awaiting only the\n",
      "sign to chastise me. As the letter was not to the inspector's liking,\n",
      "he paid no heed to it. However, he did not carry out the execution\n",
      "[of the punishment], but ordered me to rise and adjust my clothing\n",
      "and come to his desk. I thought that it was to make peace, but it\n",
      "was only to vary the mode of affliction by changing the torture,\n",
      "which he ordered to be given me between the fingers, while placed on\n",
      "my knees before him with folded hands. For that purpose some little\n",
      "rounded sticks were brought, in which there were some small grooves\n",
      "at each end and in the middle. Those sticks were placed between the\n",
      "fingers of both hands and were then pressed together by some cords,\n",
      "tighter and tighter as the inspector ordered--until, when I fell as if\n",
      "in a faint, he ordered the torment to cease. He ordered me to be gone,\n",
      "and said that, if I did not give him a thousand taes of silver on the\n",
      "morrow (each tae being equivalent to ten reals, thus all amounting to\n",
      "about one thousand ducados), he would kill me. I left his presence,\n",
      "with the bad treatment that I have described, and went to my lodgings\n",
      "as best as I could, where I found an order from the inspector not to\n",
      "receive me. I knew not where to go, for all fled from me, being fearful\n",
      "lest some blow should come upon them by reason of me. I determined to\n",
      "go to the ship where the fathers were. Then the merchants returned,\n",
      "much earlier than was their custom, saying that all the city had\n",
      "risen against them, because I had gone to their ship. They besought\n",
      "me not to do so evil an act, for they feared a serious danger from\n",
      "that. As they refused to receive me, I returned to the shore, where\n",
      "a Chinese trader who had been in Manila on various occasions received\n",
      "me into his house. He got me the loan of one hundred taes of silver,\n",
      "payable with interest; and that night I went clad as a Chinese,\n",
      "so that I might not be recognized, to the Portuguese ships. On my\n",
      "word--which I pledged on that of General Don Luis, in whose cause\n",
      "I was acting--they lent me two hundred more. I sent that whole sum\n",
      "to the inspector next day by my host, who was a man of esteem in\n",
      "the city; I also had him ask that the inspector would be satisfied\n",
      "with that amount, as I had borrowed it as an alms, and could find\n",
      "no more, and that he would be pleased to liberate the prisoners,\n",
      "and grant us permission to go to our ship. That was a just petition,\n",
      "but it was ill received and worse despatched; for although I thought\n",
      "that that gift would soften that heart of stone, I discovered that it\n",
      "had been like throwing a little water on the forge which blazes all\n",
      "the fiercer. The inspector sent a constable with his chapa to summon\n",
      "me that afternoon. It was necessary to go; and, thanks to my host,\n",
      "who accompanied me, they took me to the entrance by another gate of\n",
      "the city, as it was nearer his house. But when the guards saw me they\n",
      "refused to allow me to enter, and although the constable showed them\n",
      "the chapa of the inspector, they declared that that concerned me, and\n",
      "not them; accordingly, they refused me entrance. It was necessary for\n",
      "the constable to go to his master, and report the matter to him. The\n",
      "latter gave another chapa for the gatekeepers, and they, taking it,\n",
      "copied it and allowed me to enter. I did not find the inspector in his\n",
      "court, but in a lodging nearer the center of the city. He was the only\n",
      "one seated, while all his officials were standing. The money which I\n",
      "had had sent to him was on a desk. I knelt down, at a considerable\n",
      "distance from him, whereupon he began to chide me, and to say many\n",
      "things to me that I did not understand. It seemed to me that he was\n",
      "asking questions of me, and I only answered Purhiautet--that is to say,\n",
      "\"I do not understand.\" He rose from his chair, and came toward me,\n",
      "in order to address me from a shorter distance. It seemed from his\n",
      "actions that he meant to scratch out my eyes with his fingers (they\n",
      "are great men for such deeds, the more when they are angry). He finally\n",
      "satisfied his wrath by ordering me to be taken straight to the prison\n",
      "where the soldiers were. An iron chain was therefore quickly put about\n",
      "my neck, and fastened with a padlock; and one of the executioners,\n",
      "holding the end of it, walked before me, obliging me thus to follow\n",
      "him as a captive. The prison was at a considerable distance, and was\n",
      "under the orders of another mandarin, to whom he sent me, so that\n",
      "the latter might incarcerate me. In such guise, I crossed all those\n",
      "streets, which swarmed with people, at four o'clock in the afternoon,\n",
      "and appeared before this mandarin--who was in his tribunal, into which\n",
      "the door of the prison opened. When the soldiers saw me through the\n",
      "door, they began to weep. [I fell on my knees before him, and he asked\n",
      "me through my interpreter the cause of my imprisonment. I replied,\n",
      "and the cause seemed to him bad: but he told me that no one could\n",
      "undo what the inspector did. He said that he would try to satisfy the\n",
      "inspector, because the latter was obliged to go off very quickly on\n",
      "his inspection, and, if he left me a prisoner here, no one else had\n",
      "the authority to release me. With this he ordered the chains to be\n",
      "taken off, and sent me into the prison. When I saw myself in prison\n",
      "with the soldiers I was without anxiety, because for their sake I\n",
      "had made all these stations, [21] and after all without succeeding in\n",
      "rescuing the prisoners--though I could have taken refuge in our ships\n",
      "if I had chosen, as I afterwards did; while now, by adventuring the\n",
      "same fortune with them, I left God to watch over all. There were in\n",
      "this prison some three hundred prisoners, many condemned to death,\n",
      "but permitted to work during the daytime in order to earn their\n",
      "food. I suffered in the prison, because I had little protection and\n",
      "the weather was very cold. God delivered me within only three days;\n",
      "my host became my security for a thousand taes. As I was about to\n",
      "leave the prison, all the servants crowded about me asking for plata\n",
      "(silver), for they already knew its name in our Castilian. There were\n",
      "so many that, even if I had had much to give, there would have been\n",
      "little for each one. As I had nothing to give, I gave them nothing,\n",
      "and they paid me with hard words and blows. It was very late; and we\n",
      "were obliged to go to the house of the inspector, and from it to that\n",
      "of the guarantor outside of the city, in which we were not permitted\n",
      "to sleep. All this was to be done before they closed the gates. We\n",
      "were kept waiting in the courtyard of the inspector for some time. In\n",
      "addition to falling on our knees before him, he made us bow our heads\n",
      "and then turned us over to our bondsman. When we reached the latter's\n",
      "house, we had to enter by leaping over a lighted fire which they said\n",
      "was the ceremony of security. The poor guarantor immediately began\n",
      "to suffer persecution, for all the servants and attendants of the\n",
      "inspector, though they had in no way intervened in our business, came\n",
      "to beg money from him from that which they said he must have received\n",
      "from me, to persuade him to become my security. The man brought all\n",
      "these demands to me; but I answered him that nothing more was to be\n",
      "paid than the thousand taes, and these we should get from Don Luis. He\n",
      "was unwilling to go to Don Luis, and took great care to prevent us from\n",
      "escaping. We, fearing that Don Luis and his soldiers might be forced\n",
      "by our delay to leave us in this embarrassment, determined to save\n",
      "ourselves. We agreed with a Chinaman, for ten taes to help us escape,\n",
      "letting us out through a secret door opening upon a creek that flowed\n",
      "into the large river, and taking us down in a boat. We sailed down\n",
      "stream that night and the next day, no one appearing on the boat in\n",
      "the daytime except the Chinese sailors. We succeeded in eluding all\n",
      "the vessels that might have wished to inspect us, and reached our\n",
      "ships. As soon as our sailors received their pay they ran away. A\n",
      "few hours later, my guarantor appeared with an armed vessel. He was\n",
      "unable to find out who had helped us, and was satisfied with receiving\n",
      "the amount of money for which he had been pledged. We then set sail,\n",
      "Don Luis and the rest to Manila, and I to Macan, for I was in such a\n",
      "condition of ill health as a result of hardship and exposure that I did\n",
      "not dare to undertake the voyage to Manila. At this time father Fray\n",
      "Alonso Ximenez died in Macan. His death was caused by the hardships\n",
      "and exposure which he had undergone in endeavoring to evangelize the\n",
      "kingdom of Camboja. Though he was almost seventy years of age when\n",
      "he set out on the expedition, he endured everything that befell him\n",
      "with patience and courage, consoling the others, though he had always\n",
      "himself the most to suffer. He was very devout, never omitting his\n",
      "daily hours of prayer on his journeys or voyages. When in Cochinchina,\n",
      "his captivity was comforted by the opportunity given him to convert\n",
      "two condemned criminals. The failures of his attempts to reach the\n",
      "kingdom of Camboja and to convert the people there did not discourage\n",
      "him or diminish his enthusiasm. When Don Luis and his men were\n",
      "cruelly attacked by the Portuguese of Macan, father Fray Alonso\n",
      "went to Macan to interpose his authority, and to act as mediator\n",
      "between the Portuguese and the Castilians. Father Fray Alonso had\n",
      "great difficulty in pacifying the Portuguese, and was obliged to\n",
      "encounter much vituperation; but he received more joy in the baptism\n",
      "of two sick persons at the point of death than he had lost in all\n",
      "the sufferings which have been narrated. He died in our convent at\n",
      "Macan, to the great sorrow of the religious about him at the loss of\n",
      "so holy an associate. General Don Luis and all of the troops that he\n",
      "had brought with him attributed to the loss of father Fray Alonso\n",
      "all the sufferings which they were obliged to undergo afterward;\n",
      "while they ascribed to his presence and his prayers the rescue of\n",
      "their ship in the dreadful storm which they had experienced on the\n",
      "day of St. Francis. On that day they had been in the midst of shoals,\n",
      "and had seen many Chinese vessels wrecked about them; and the wind had\n",
      "been so violent that it had thrown down many strongly-rooted trees\n",
      "on land. Father Fray Alonso was a son of the convent of S. Esteban\n",
      "at Salamanca. Desirous for the conversion of the Indians, he passed\n",
      "his youth in the devout province of Guatemala. Having retired\n",
      "to his convent, to take up the works of Mary after he had done\n",
      "those of Martha, he heard of the foundation of the province of the\n",
      "Philippinas. When many were turned back by the difficulties in Mexico,\n",
      "father Fray Alonso was always firm and constant. When he reached\n",
      "Manila, the ministry of Batan fell to his lot. In spite of his age, and\n",
      "the great difficulty which he had in learning the Indian language, he\n",
      "at length succeeded. In this ministry he suffered the hardships which\n",
      "have been described already. He was especially kind and serviceable\n",
      "to sick Indians, preparing dishes of meat or eggs for them, and even\n",
      "putting the food in their mouths, with his own hands. Being taken\n",
      "severely ill as a result of all the hardships to which he was exposed,\n",
      "he was carried to the convent of Manila. Scarcely did he feel better,\n",
      "when he left his bed and began to work at the building of the church,\n",
      "turning his hand to this manual labor with the greatest skill. When\n",
      "he was elected prior, he had no assistance in the convent except one\n",
      "priest and one lay brother; but, few as they were, they performed all\n",
      "the offices of a community. As he had a sonorous voice and understood\n",
      "music well, he would sing the whole mass alone; then leave the choir\n",
      "to go to the pulpit and preach, and then return to the choir, though\n",
      "he had been hearing confessions all the morning. This he did without\n",
      "failing to make his regular daily prayer. Even when alone he used to\n",
      "say matins aloud, and on some feast-days would sing a great part of\n",
      "them. He was elected provincial from this office of prior; and in his\n",
      "provincialate he made many excellent ordinances for the ministry to\n",
      "the Indians, which are still observed and esteemed as if they had been\n",
      "ordained yesterday. During his time the province was greatly extended,\n",
      "the whole of the province of Nueva Segovia being admitted, and many\n",
      "new churches and missions being established in that of Pangasinan. It\n",
      "was his desire also that the kingdom of Camboxa should be added to\n",
      "it; and in the glorious enterprise of extending the gospel to that\n",
      "kingdom he ended his life.]\n",

      "CHAPTER LI\n",
      "\n",
      "The coming of some religious to the province, and the transactions\n",
      "of the intermediate chapter\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Though the procurator whom this province had in Espana [i.e.,\n",
      "Benavides] had become bishop of Nueva Segovia, he gave his main\n",
      "attention to the augmentation of the province, having seen with\n",
      "his own eyes the service done by the religious here to the Lord,\n",
      "and their service to their neighbors. So, though he had sent off\n",
      "two shipments [of missionaries], he prepared to send a third, whom\n",
      "he should accompany when he went to his bishopric. So greatly had\n",
      "the hearts of the religious of all the provinces in Espana been\n",
      "moved that sixty were found gathered and assembled together, having\n",
      "been designated by Father Juan Volante. They were all far advanced\n",
      "in religion and letters, which are the excellences that the order\n",
      "desires and strives for in its sons, that they may fulfil the command\n",
      "of its institutes, by laboring not only for their own salvation,\n",
      "but for that of others. It happened at this time that the English\n",
      "found the city of Cadiz unguarded and unprepared, and sacked it. [22]\n",
      "This aroused a great excitement in all the ports of Andalucia; and\n",
      "the announcement was made that in that year there would be no fleet\n",
      "for Nueva Espana. Though all these religious were at that time in or\n",
      "near Andalucia, they returned to their provinces of Espana and Aragon\n",
      "whence they had set out, with the exception of some few who waited\n",
      "to see the end of this matter. Although it was true that there was\n",
      "no fleet, a rumor spread that some ships were being fitted out for\n",
      "the voyage. Hereupon the bishop--who had come on foot from Madrid,\n",
      "but had been several days on the return journey because of the\n",
      "misfortune which had happened--took courage and went to the port a\n",
      "second time, reassembling the religious as well as he could. With\n",
      "these, and with some others who offered themselves, he made up a\n",
      "reasonable number. When they reached the port they found that the\n",
      "ships which were about to sail were only some galizabras, with troops\n",
      "who were going to guard the silver which came from Peru and Nueva\n",
      "Espana. It seemed that for a second time the purpose of the bishop\n",
      "and the religious had been frustrated and their labor wasted; but God\n",
      "sent them a patache or fragata, with only one deck, which was to carry\n",
      "the baggage and the ship's stores; but it had no accommodations for\n",
      "passengers, and was not designed to carry them, because of its small\n",
      "size. In spite of this, their willingness to suffer even greater\n",
      "evils for God made them despise the hardships which they might\n",
      "suffer by making so long a voyage on so uncomfortable a vessel, and\n",
      "they determined to sail in it. They spread the only tarpaulin which\n",
      "there was, that they might have some defense from the sun and the\n",
      "rain. They could not place it high enough for them to stand under it,\n",
      "and whenever the sea was rough the waves dashed over it; but, as there\n",
      "was no better ship, the bishop and the religious had to take advantage\n",
      "of this one. The Lord felt such compassion for their discomfort as\n",
      "to give them fair weather, so that during the sixty days of their\n",
      "voyage it only rained twice: thus they were able to sleep on deck,\n",
      "and at least to enjoy the coolness of night if they could not avoid\n",
      "the heat of the day. During the voyage, they acted as if they were in\n",
      "a very well-organized convent. The bishop filled the place of reader;\n",
      "and upon what he read they held daily conferences, and very frequent\n",
      "sermons and spiritual discourses. On the great feasts they had, as\n",
      "it were, literary contests, composing verses in praise of God and of\n",
      "His saints. Being thus very well occupied, they felt the discomfort\n",
      "of the ship less; and as a result of the fair weather they were all\n",
      "cheerful. The bishop alone was silent--so much so that his religious\n",
      "became anxious, and felt obliged to ask him the reason. He answered:\n",
      "\"I am afraid, fathers, that the Lord does not look upon us as His\n",
      "own, so much happiness does He grant us in so cramped a ship. Such\n",
      "fair weather, and not more than one religious sick; we are not what\n",
      "we ought to be, for the Lord has sent us no hardships. My coming was\n",
      "sufficient to prevent you from receiving that blessing.\" When they\n",
      "reached Mexico, he planned to buy a house where the religious who came\n",
      "to this province from that of Espana might be cared for. He wished to\n",
      "avoid scattering them among the towns, the evil results of which had\n",
      "already been learned by experience. He found someone to make a gift\n",
      "of a piece of land suited for the purpose, with the obligation of\n",
      "building a church upon it named for St. Just and Pastor. The writings\n",
      "were already made out; but afterward, because of difficulties which\n",
      "arose, the agreement went no further and had to be given up.\n",
      "\n",
      "The voyage which they made from Acapulco to Manila was very\n",
      "prosperous. The religious having been divided between the two ships,\n",
      "those who embarked in the flagship, called \"Rosario,\" were unable\n",
      "to get their ship-stores on board because of the great hurry of the\n",
      "commander, Don Fernando de Castro. But God provided for them from the\n",
      "ocean; for every day without exception they fished from that ship,\n",
      "and thus the food of the religious was supplied. This is something\n",
      "which never happened before or since that voyage to any ship. Being so\n",
      "extraordinary, it caused astonishment, and gave reason for reflecting\n",
      "upon and praising the divine Providence, which with so free a hand\n",
      "comes to the aid of those who depend upon it in their need. The\n",
      "intermediate provincial chapter was in session when the bishop and\n",
      "the religious reached Manila; and thus they were received joyfully\n",
      "and gladly, and the meeting was enriched by their presence. Religious\n",
      "were assigned to the conversion of villages which, though they had been\n",
      "admitted for their own comfort and for the sake of somewhat encouraging\n",
      "the holy desires with which they so eagerly begged for missionaries,\n",
      "could not hitherto obtain them, because of the lack of missionaries\n",
      "to send. In the convent of Manila a regular school of theology and\n",
      "arts was established. The chapter appointed as preacher-general father\n",
      "Fray Diego de Soria in place of father Fray Miguel de Venavides, who\n",
      "had hitherto held this place and had now become bishop. Because of the\n",
      "small number of religious and of convents up to this time, it had been\n",
      "customary that some should be designated from the distant provinces\n",
      "to come and vote in the provincial chapters, although they were not\n",
      "superiors. Now, however, as there was a sufficient number of convents\n",
      "and of superiors, vicariates were designated, the vicars of which were\n",
      "to be in the place of priors. These and no others were now to have a\n",
      "vote in the provincial chapter, in conformity with the constitutions\n",
      "and privileges of the provinces of the Indias. It was also ordained\n",
      "that the confirmation of the newly-elected provincial should belong\n",
      "to the eldest definitor, according to the privilege of Nueva Espana,\n",
      "which is likewise that of this province. At this chapter there were\n",
      "received: in Nueva Segovia the village of Dumon, the church of which\n",
      "at that time was called San Antonino; the villages of Gatarang and\n",
      "Talapa, with the church of Sancta Catalina; and the village on the\n",
      "estuary of Lobo, the church of which was San Raymundo. The title of\n",
      "vicariate was given to San Pablo of Pilitan in Yrraya. [23] In this\n",
      "place it seemed that another climate had been found, different from\n",
      "that of the rest of this province, other fields and spacious meadows,\n",
      "another temperature, and another race of people. The country is very\n",
      "fertile, and abounds in game. It is very well watered, very pleasant\n",
      "and very healthful, although at first it did not seem so for the\n",
      "religious. The first vicar straightway died, and those whom he took\n",
      "as associates were afflicted with severe illness. For this reason\n",
      "and because of the distance from the other convents, it seemed to\n",
      "many that it would be best to abandon it; but the desire prevailed to\n",
      "go to the aid of those souls, though at the cost of health and life,\n",
      "since on no occasion could these be better offered. [The devil greatly\n",
      "resented their coming, and complained and uttered frightful howlings\n",
      "through the mouths of his priestesses or aniteras. The coming of the\n",
      "missionaries and the building of churches forced him to show himself\n",
      "in his true light to his deluded followers. He often appeared to them\n",
      "in dreams, bidding them resist and not become Christians. When they\n",
      "reminded him that he did not resist, he answered that he could not\n",
      "endure the sight of \"those barbarians with white teeth.\" He called\n",
      "the religious \"barbarians,\" because of their little knowledge of\n",
      "the language at the beginning; and he spoke of their white teeth\n",
      "because the Indians regard this as a blemish, and make their own teeth\n",
      "black.] In this mission of Pilitan the fathers found a madman with a\n",
      "child, whom they desired to baptize as other children generally were\n",
      "baptized; the father feared that they wished to take it away, and\n",
      "never left it. He ate with it, slept with it, and went to the bath\n",
      "with it. He did all he could to give it pleasure, but as a madman\n",
      "would. Hence, often, in bathing it, he plunged it down so far under\n",
      "the water that he drew it out half dead. The religious was in great\n",
      "anxiety, fearing some disaster, and finally baptized it. Soon after,\n",
      "the father caught a venomous serpent, ate it, and caused his child\n",
      "to share in the meal. They both died, but the child to live forever,\n",
      "thanks to the care of the missionary in baptizing it so as to give it\n",
      "grace and glory. [From the last village which at that time had been\n",
      "discovered, which was named Balisi, an Indian came with his family to\n",
      "that of Pilitan to spend a few days. He brought with him his little\n",
      "daughter, who was only six years old. She was so bright and charming\n",
      "that all who saw her loved her. She grew so fond of the church that,\n",
      "though she was a heathen, she wept bitterly when she was obliged by\n",
      "her father to return to their own village. Soon after, falling sick\n",
      "to death, she was baptized by a Spaniard named Alonso Vazquez, who\n",
      "happened to be there. The Lord showed His kindness in several other\n",
      "striking or marvelous instances of baptism. In one case a little girl\n",
      "was very ill and the father had given his permission for baptism,\n",
      "but the relatives and all the rest of the village resisted. Father\n",
      "Antonio de Soria went there and asked him that they would let him\n",
      "look at her to cure her. Spreading over her a moist cloth which he\n",
      "had brought purposely, he cured her soul, which was soon to taste\n",
      "the joys of eternal salvation.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the province of Pangasinan there was added by this chapter a church\n",
      "and village, that of San Jacintho, which was formed here of people\n",
      "from different regions, on a very pleasant river named Magaldan,\n",
      "[24] the inhabitants gathering to it from several villages and some\n",
      "from the mountains of the region. The Lord showed His kindness to\n",
      "one woman by striking her with blindness when she purposed to run\n",
      "away from the baptism which she had promised to receive, and by thus\n",
      "bringing her back to the salvation of her soul.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this time the Lord took to himself father Fray Antonio de Soria,\n",
      "one of the first missionaries of Nueva Segovia. He did not enter upon\n",
      "the religious life, as generally happens, when he was in boyhood or\n",
      "youth, but in mature manhood. He had been left a widower; and though\n",
      "he had sons to care for, he provided for them in such a way that\n",
      "he was no longer needed to attend to them. Being thus left free for\n",
      "the service of God alone, he determined to become a religious, and\n",
      "was accepted in the convent of our order at Puebla de Los Angeles,\n",
      "in Nueva Espana. Most persons of this age and condition, especially\n",
      "when they have lived in the luxuries which are common in Nueva Espana,\n",
      "find it difficult to accommodate themselves to the severities of\n",
      "religious life, both in little and in great things. Father Antonio\n",
      "was not such. He began with the greatest humility to study Latin,\n",
      "and became a master of the tongue. He entered upon greater studies,\n",
      "following them with such success that he was made lecturer in arts\n",
      "and a director of students. And as he was so superior not only in\n",
      "his learning, but also in virtue, he was also appointed master of\n",
      "novices, which is the same thing as being a teacher of the religious\n",
      "life. He joined the fathers who came to these islands in 1595, and\n",
      "became one of the first missionaries to the province of Nueva Segovia,\n",
      "there suffering all the want, discomfort, and hunger which have been\n",
      "described. The first results of his mission were at Camalaniugan, where\n",
      "he drove a demon out of a woman who was possessed. In the following\n",
      "provincial chapter, he was appointed superior of Nueva Segovia, to\n",
      "preach to and teach and guide the Spanish, who in these new conquests\n",
      "need the best of teachers. For his consolation they gave him the care\n",
      "of the villages of Camalaniugan and Buguey. Not satisfied with all\n",
      "this, he also took charge of the village of Daludu.] There lived in\n",
      "that city Captain Alonso de Carvajal, encomendero of Pilitan, which\n",
      "is distant from the city five or more days' journey. He collected\n",
      "his tribute from the natives, and desired to give them a minister,\n",
      "as he was obliged; but he was unable to find anyone who was willing\n",
      "to undertake the mission. He accordingly urged father Fray Antonio\n",
      "to go to visit these Indians and their country, called Yrraya, to\n",
      "see if he could attract them to the law of God and the belief in\n",
      "His holy gospel. The journey was long and hard, not only because it\n",
      "was up the river, but because there were enemies on the road; and,\n",
      "besides, there was no religious to leave in his place. Yet the desire\n",
      "of converting heathen was so strong in father Fray Antonio that he\n",
      "overcame all these obstacles and went to this new spiritual conquest,\n",
      "in which all of the rest of the religious soon aided him. He preached\n",
      "the holy gospel, and the Lord gave him such favor with that tribe,\n",
      "that he led them by his command like tame sheep. The credit which they\n",
      "gave to his teaching was such that long after, when Christianity was\n",
      "more settled in Yrraya, and there was some difficulty in rooting out\n",
      "some superstition which had remained among them, the old people said:\n",
      "\"If father Fray Antonio had commanded us that, there would not now\n",
      "be a trace of it, or anyone to contradict him.\" To build the church\n",
      "in the village of Pilitan, he threw down the hut of an old woman, a\n",
      "noted anitera, by whom the devil gave answers to the questions which\n",
      "were asked him. As this was done in this hut, the devil regarded it\n",
      "as his own, and therefore greatly resented the overthrow of it. This\n",
      "he said on many occasions, and he even sometimes said that he had\n",
      "killed the father for tearing down his hut. But in this the Father\n",
      "of Lies should not be credited; for, as he often confessed, he was\n",
      "not able to appear before the religious; how much less, then, to kill\n",
      "them. The manner of living followed by this father among these Indians\n",
      "was exemplary, and such as to cause wonder among them. He suffered\n",
      "and endured many hardships, and hunger and want, that he might not\n",
      "inconvenience them. He was at once the master and the servant, at the\n",
      "house. In order that a boy who served him by preparing his food might\n",
      "not be offended at the work, the father went to the river and carried\n",
      "the water that he had to drink; he was the sacristan who cared for the\n",
      "church, the porter who closed and opened the doors of the house. He\n",
      "it was who attended to everything that was needed, that he might not\n",
      "trouble any persons by making them serve him. It was a journey of\n",
      "a day and a half from Pilitan to the village of Nalavangan. He went\n",
      "there and built a church, and baptized many; for the spirit of Fray\n",
      "Antonio was to undertake much, and he was never contented with that\n",
      "which would have seemed excessive to others. While he was engaged in\n",
      "these holy exercises, the time of the intermediate chapter arrived,\n",
      "and he was obliged to go to it to Manila. Here he was definitor,\n",
      "and gave an account of the good work which was being wrought by\n",
      "the Lord in the conversion of Yrraya. The chapter, feeling that the\n",
      "Lord had chosen him therefor, appointed him as first vicar of San\n",
      "Pablo at Pilitan. He returned in great contentment, because he was\n",
      "going where he would have more to do than in other places, much as\n",
      "there was to do everywhere, since all of these were new conversions,\n",
      "where the labor is great and the ease very little. When he was among\n",
      "his children he gave himself with such devotion to the labor of the\n",
      "ministry that within six months he was attacked by a mortal disease,\n",
      "which obliged him to return to the city to be cared for. Here, when he\n",
      "had received the holy sacrament, he gave up his soul to his Creator,\n",
      "to the great sorrow of all the religious, who were greatly afflicted\n",
      "to lose such a father and associate. He made some compositions in\n",
      "the language of the natives, which served as a guide to those who\n",
      "followed him; but the greatest guidance that he gave was that of his\n",
      "life spent and consumed in these so holy exercises.\n",

      "Pedro de la Bastida who died at this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "[Father Fray Pedro de Soto was a native of Burgos, and assumed the\n",
      "habit in the convent of San Andres at Medina del Campo, where he\n",
      "professed, and whence he went to study in the distinguished convent of\n",
      "San Pablo at Valladolid. Here he showed signs of his great ability and\n",
      "the subtlety of his mind, soaring above his fellow-students as does a\n",
      "royal eagle above all other birds of less flight. In him the fathers\n",
      "hoped that they were to have a third Soto, in addition to the other two\n",
      "famous ones whom that province has had. He exhibited as much virtue as\n",
      "learning. When the religious for this province began to be gathered,\n",
      "his superiors were planning that he should become a professor. The\n",
      "devotion and the severity of the discipline, and the opportunity to\n",
      "save souls, attracted father Fray Pedro; he was also influenced by\n",
      "the example of his two masters, Fray Miguel de Venavides and Fray\n",
      "Antonio Arcediano, who had left their chairs of theology to enter\n",
      "the new province, as had also two other fathers, lecturers in arts\n",
      "at the same convent. The father master Fray Hernando del Castillo,\n",
      "who was then prior, strove by all means to prevent him from going;\n",
      "but the calling and inspiration of God prevailed in the heart of father\n",
      "Fray Pedro. He arrived at Manila July 23, and on the day of our father\n",
      "St. Dominic, less than a fortnight later, they asked him to hold some\n",
      "public discussions of theology in the main church. Father Fray Pedro\n",
      "avoided display of his knowledge and ability; but, on occasions when\n",
      "necessity required him to speak, he made evident the great superiority\n",
      "of his mind and his great learning. In the first distribution of the\n",
      "religious, he was assigned to Pangasinan. The people of this region\n",
      "still lived in their ancient villages and rancherias in the hills and\n",
      "mountains, without civilization, order, or system, any more than if\n",
      "they had never known Spaniards. Father Fray Pedro lived among these\n",
      "tribes for three years, suffering the hardships and perils which\n",
      "have been already described. He was constantly in danger of death,\n",
      "being particularly hateful to the hostile natives because he was\n",
      "the first one who learned the language of the Indians. When some of\n",
      "them began to accept the faith, he offered money for information as\n",
      "to those who continued to sacrifice to the devil. Keeping secret the\n",
      "source of his information, he immediately went] in haste to the place,\n",
      "sometimes alone, and caught the sacrificers in the very act. Without\n",
      "waiting an instant, he upset everything, and broke the dishes and\n",
      "bowls and other vessels which they used in their rites; poured out\n",
      "their wine; burned the robes in which the aniteras or priestesses\n",
      "dress themselves on such occasions, and the curtains with which\n",
      "they covered up everything else; threw down the hut, and completely\n",
      "destroyed it. In this way he made them understand how little all those\n",
      "things availed, and how vain were the threats which the devil uttered\n",
      "against those who would not venerate him; and, in brief, that this\n",
      "was all falsehood and deceit. Many were thus aroused and undeceived;\n",
      "while others, and not a few, were angry, so that it was a wonder\n",
      "that he was not slain. [The rest of the fathers followed his plan;\n",
      "but father Fray Pedro led them all, following the track of this chase,\n",
      "in which his scent was so keen that nothing could escape him. At his\n",
      "death, father Fray Pedro was able to say that he was sure of the two\n",
      "aureoles of virgin and of doctor, and that he had almost succeeded\n",
      "in gaining that of martyr. The village of Magaldan was the most\n",
      "obstinate of all these villages in their errors. They had striven to\n",
      "kill a father of the Order of St. Francis, insomuch that the dagger\n",
      "was already lifted above him for that purpose, and he had fled. They\n",
      "had refused to admit the fathers of the Order of St. Augustine, and\n",
      "they would not listen to a secular priest who was assigned to them,\n",
      "although the alcalde-mayor fined and punished them. It was these\n",
      "Indians whom father Fray Pedro de Soto came to conquer with patience\n",
      "and Christian charity. The Indians said that he never employed a\n",
      "word of their language wrong. He was engaged for a whole year in\n",
      "translating the gospel into this language, and translated some lives\n",
      "of saints and instances of virtue--which though they were composed in\n",
      "the very beginning, are still esteemed and are greatly prized, because\n",
      "of the propriety of the words and the elevated style with which he\n",
      "treated these matters. He was devoted to the study of theology and\n",
      "sacred letters, and was continual in both mental and vocal prayer,\n",
      "to which he added fasting. Being taken to Manila to be treated for\n",
      "the fever from which he suffered, he died there.\n",
      "\n",
      "In spite of the failure of the two previous expeditions to Camboja,\n",
      "the governor, Don Francisco Tello, judged it desirable to send another\n",
      "ship with troops, and asked the order to send some of their friars with\n",
      "it. The father provincial directed that father Fray Juan de S. Pedro\n",
      "Martyr (or Maldonado) and father Fray Pedro Jesus (or de la Bastida)\n",
      "should go. Father Fray Juan was then commissary of the Holy Office. He\n",
      "was a native of Alcala de Guadiana, [25] and belonged to a rich and\n",
      "honorable family. He studied canon law at Salamanca, and assumed\n",
      "the habit in the illustrious convent of San Pablo at Valladolid. The\n",
      "influence of Father Juan Chrisostomo attracted him to the new province\n",
      "to be established in the Philippinas Islands. When he was about to set\n",
      "forth, a certain Doctor Bobadilla, a canon in the church in Valladolid,\n",
      "took him to one side and assured him that he was to die a martyr;\n",
      "and this prophecy was corroborated by another devoted monk. It was\n",
      "on this account that he changed his name of Maldonado to that of\n",
      "S. Pedro Martyr. He spent his first year in the Philipinas in Manila;\n",
      "and in his second year was sent as vicar to a village in Pangasinan,\n",
      "which was at that time the most difficult in the province. From that\n",
      "place he was transferred to the vicariate of Bataan, the language of\n",
      "which he learned very well. When Father Juan Cobo went as ambassador\n",
      "to Japon, father Fray Juan was assigned to the mission to the Chinese,\n",
      "being thus required to learn a third language in addition to the two\n",
      "which he already knew. He learned more words of the Chinese language\n",
      "than any other member of the order, though he was not successful\n",
      "with the pronunciation. He assisted the Chinese so much that they\n",
      "named him as their protector; and he was, as it were, the advocate\n",
      "of their causes, so that they became very much attached to him, and\n",
      "listened with good-will to his preaching and his corrections. During\n",
      "the absence of the father provincial in Camboja, the province could\n",
      "find no one more suitable to govern it in his place, and accordingly\n",
      "father Fray Juan was nominated as vicar-general. In the following\n",
      "provincial chapter he was appointed lecturer in theology, for there\n",
      "was nothing which the province did not find him competent to do. He\n",
      "made no objection to carrying out any orders that were given him,\n",
      "although they dragged him about hither and thither, causing him to\n",
      "learn so many languages and immediately to drop them again. This is a\n",
      "great evidence of his obedience and subjection to his superior. His\n",
      "reputation outside of the order was very great.] The tribunal of\n",
      "the Holy Office of Mexico appointed him commissary-general of the\n",
      "Philippinas, which office he filled with the prudence and strength\n",
      "of mind which the Lord has given in these regions to the sons of the\n",
      "first inquisitor-general, our father St. Dominic. Don Luis Perez das\n",
      "Marinas, a wise and holy knight, refused to accept the governorship of\n",
      "these islands until Fray Juan persuaded him to do so, stood security\n",
      "for him, and undertook the duty of confessing him and of aiding him\n",
      "with his good advice, that he might the better fulfil the office. This\n",
      "he did in spite of the fact that this was certain to be, as it was,\n",
      "to his own damage; for suitors who did not receive what they desired\n",
      "immediately threw the blame on Father Juan, whom they well knew that\n",
      "the governor consulted as to the appointments which he made. Father\n",
      "Fray Juan knew all this well, but accepted it very readily, in order\n",
      "that he might undertake the direction of so upright a man as Don\n",
      "Luis. In spite of the fact that the esteem which was felt for Father\n",
      "Juan within and without the order was very great, the counterweight\n",
      "of humility and the consciousness of his own inferiority which he had\n",
      "was much greater. He regarded himself as the most useless in all the\n",
      "province, and treated himself as such. Hence, when he was named for\n",
      "vicar-general of the province, he managed that this title and office\n",
      "should be given to father Fray Juan de Sancto Thomas. [In the same way,\n",
      "when he was nominated prior of the convent of Manila at the time when\n",
      "father Fray Diego de Soria went as procurator to Espana, he succeeded\n",
      "in bringing about the election of another religious. He likewise strove\n",
      "to resign the office of commissary in favor of father Fray Bernardo de\n",
      "Sancta Cathalina, or Navarro. Such was the character of father Fray\n",
      "Juan de San Pedro Martyr, whom the province was willing to spare for\n",
      "the mission to Camboja. They would have spared an even more perfect\n",
      "religious if they could, well knowing that he who had to preach the\n",
      "gospel in a heathen kingdom like this should be such as father Fray\n",
      "Juan was, or even greater in all things. The companion of father\n",
      "Fray Juan, father Fray Pedro de Jesus or de la Bastida, a religious\n",
      "of great virtue, had come to the islands in the previous year, 1591,\n",
      "with the rest who were brought from Espana by father Fray Francisco de\n",
      "Morales. He had displayed high qualities in the mission to Bataan, to\n",
      "which he had been assigned. He had come from the very devout province\n",
      "of Aragon, of which he was a son. When they reached the great river\n",
      "of Camboja, father Fray Juan endeavored to carry out his mission,\n",
      "both for the conversion of those tribes and as an ambassador of\n",
      "the king our lord. He was contemptuously treated by the king, [26]\n",
      "the son of that king who had sent to ask for religious. The present\n",
      "king was wholly in the hands of Mahometan Malays, who persuaded him\n",
      "that the embassy involved some evil to him. When father Fray Juan\n",
      "asked his permission to return to the ship which they had left in\n",
      "the port, the king refused to grant it, and thus showed that he\n",
      "was plotting treachery. Father Fray Juan saw no opportunity for\n",
      "preaching the gospel, as the country was disturbed and in arms; and\n",
      "as the two captains, Diego Velloso and Blas Ruiz de Fernan Goncalez,\n",
      "were in a difficult situation because their comrades were so few,\n",
      "and the Malays, their enemies, were in such favor. The captain of\n",
      "the ship [i.e., Mendoza] attempted to secure peace between these\n",
      "factions, but did not disembark from his vessel. The same thing was\n",
      "done by the captain of a fragata that had come from Sian. The Malays,\n",
      "seeing that they had the advantage because their vessel was larger and\n",
      "stronger than ours, made an attack and shot contrivances of fire and\n",
      "powder to burn the Spaniards and the Japanese. The ship caught fire,\n",
      "and those on board had to leap into the water to escape. Father Fray\n",
      "Pedro de Jesus was unable to swim, and took refuge from the fire on\n",
      "the poop. Here the Moros came out in small boats and thrust lances\n",
      "at him. He fell into the water and died of his wounds, or was drowned\n",
      "by the hands of the Moros. This vessel had done no harm to the Moros,\n",
      "and had not even tried to aid the Spanish captains in the kingdom. The\n",
      "only reason for attacking it was the desire of the Moros to prevent the\n",
      "preaching of the gospel; and hence father Fray Pedro died a glorious\n",
      "martyr. Father Fray Juan succeeded in reaching the fragata commanded\n",
      "by Juan de Mendoca. In it father Fray Juan made his escape to Sian,\n",
      "being wounded in the throat by a shot which had passed obliquely\n",
      "through it; and thus half of the prophecy had been fulfilled that he\n",
      "and his comrade were to die the death of martyrs. Father Fray Juan\n",
      "went to Sian that he might be near to the kingdom of Camboja. The king\n",
      "of that country was a cruel and barbarous tyrant; he took delight in\n",
      "causing men to be thrown to wild elephants, who tore them to pieces\n",
      "with their trunks. He caused others to be fried with a very small\n",
      "quantity of oil, and their flesh to be torn off from them with pincers\n",
      "while they were thus tortured, and to be thrust into their mouths,\n",
      "that by force of the pain which they suffered they might bite and eat\n",
      "their own flesh. When there were no criminals, he used to perpetrate\n",
      "these cruelties solely for his own recreation; and that not to one,\n",
      "or a few, but to a thousand at a time. Only a few days before, he had\n",
      "had four or five Portuguese fried alive for some trifling offense,\n",
      "for which they had already paid a fine to him. There were here at this\n",
      "time a Portuguese religious, Fray Jorje de la Mota, [27] and several\n",
      "other Portuguese who were now trying to escape from the country. The\n",
      "force of the tides is so great that, when the tide is coming in, it\n",
      "is impossible to make head against it; and as they were fifty leguas\n",
      "from the sea, it was easy to follow and catch them. Overjoyed with\n",
      "the possibility of escape offered by the coming of Father Juan, they\n",
      "prayed him for the love of God to rescue them in his boat without the\n",
      "knowledge of the king. The Spaniards planned to do so; but, because\n",
      "of the too great haste and anxiety of the Portuguese, the vessel was\n",
      "followed and found before it had made its escape into the sea. The\n",
      "king was mad with rage, and sent three separate expeditions after\n",
      "it. They surrounded the boat and fired at it with small cannon,\n",
      "arquebuses, arrows, and lances. There were about twenty persons,\n",
      "Castilians and Portuguese, on the ship, and they had about a dozen\n",
      "muskets and a few arquebuses to protect themselves with. So long as\n",
      "the tide was going out, they managed to defend themselves fairly well,\n",
      "because they could manage to engage a part of the enemy only at one\n",
      "time. When the tide came in they were obliged to anchor, and they\n",
      "were like a target for the Sianese. After three days of this torture,\n",
      "they managed to get to sea. The pilot had been slain by a shot; and\n",
      "the captain, Juan de Mendoca, and father Fray Jorje de la Mota were so\n",
      "badly wounded that they afterward died. The arm of father Fray Juan\n",
      "de San Pedro Martir was broken by a shot from a small culverin. As\n",
      "they had lost all their drinking-water in the combat, the sufferings\n",
      "of father Fray Juan were very great. He saw that his hour was come,\n",
      "and confessed to father Fray Jorje. He wrote to the fathers in this\n",
      "province an account of the fortunes of this voyage; and expressed\n",
      "his joy in dying on an expedition carried out by the command of his\n",
      "superior for the purpose of preaching the gospel, in which he had saved\n",
      "those poor Portuguese from dreadful danger to both their lives and\n",
      "their souls.] Almost at the end of the letter which he sent he wrote:\n",
      "\"What we have in this province is good, and God is greatly served in\n",
      "the province. Let us strive to keep what we have, by observing those\n",
      "things which we have established; for I am sure that God will show us a\n",
      "thousand favors. The arms of Saul do not fit all men; nor is preaching\n",
      "in these regions suitable to any but a very holy man.\" [They buried him\n",
      "on land near the port of Cochinchina, on an island called Pulocatovan,\n",
      "at the root of a tree--not daring to set up a cross, for fear of the\n",
      "derision of those heathen. He had set out upon this voyage certain\n",
      "to meet his death in it; and at the beginning of the expedition he\n",
      "had shown the perfection of his obedience in several ways.]\n",

      "[On the second of June, 1600, the electors assembled in the\n",
      "convent of Manila to elect a successor to father Fray Bernardo de\n",
      "Sancta Cathalina. The example of father Fray Bernardo was so grand\n",
      "that it was difficult for his successor to reach the same pitch of\n",
      "excellence. Although all felt that father Fray Juan de Sancto Thomas,\n",
      "or Ormaca, was fitted for the position by character and abilities,\n",
      "there was some doubt whether his ill-health would permit him to fill\n",
      "the office as it ought to be filled. He was constantly under the\n",
      "necessity of receiving dispensations from the severity of the rules;\n",
      "and though this did no harm in a private friar, it was most unfortunate\n",
      "in a superior. It was also feared that he would be physically unable\n",
      "to perform the duties of the situation. One of the best physicians\n",
      "of the city was called in, without the knowledge of father Fray Juan,\n",
      "to express his opinion as to the ability of father Fray Juan to fulfil\n",
      "the duties of the office. His judgment was favorable, and father Fray\n",
      "Juan was elected. The election was a most fortunate one, for father\n",
      "Fray Juan was able, learned, and holy; and his nature was so gentle\n",
      "that the vicar-general, Fray Juan de Castro, who had a gift from heaven\n",
      "of special insight into character, chose him as his usual associate,\n",
      "and appointed him to the first position as superior in a mission to\n",
      "Indians. He filled the office well, and not only lived out the four\n",
      "years of his provincialship, but has seen ten other elections of\n",
      "provincials since his own; and he is still alive while this is being\n",

      "ourselves with what has been said--leaving the rest till the time\n",
      "when, after the end of his life, it may be discussed with greater\n",
      "freedom. During his term, the Lord opened the gates for the entrance\n",
      "of the order to Japan, as will be narrated later; this was a great\n",
      "reward for the hardships suffered by the religious of this province,\n",
      "and by him in particular, from the perils and miseries of travel by\n",
      "land and by sea. Many new convents were admitted at this chapter,\n",
      "both in Pangasinan and Nueva Segovia; for the duties of the ministry\n",
      "in these regions were constantly increasing, and the religious kept\n",
      "constantly reaching out to new places. Many excellent ordinances were\n",
      "passed for the exercise of the ministry to the Indians, and also for\n",

      "the Indians.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the province of Nueva Segovia the religious labored hard in the\n",
      "search throughout mountains and valleys, and other secret places,\n",
      "for the huts where the devil had been adored, to which those people\n",
      "used to make pilgrimages in search of health or other favors,\n",
      "giving offerings of bits of gold, or of stones regarded by them as\n",
      "precious. The natives dared not take anything from those places, or\n",
      "cut a reed or a tree from the natural growth of the earth in them,\n",
      "for fear of death, with which the devil had threatened them. In the\n",
      "villages on the coast many such little huts were found, with many\n",
      "little figures and idols in them. The religious burnt and broke the\n",
      "boxes with the offerings; took the gold and the stones, and all the\n",
      "other offerings; and burnt and ground to dust everything, and cast it\n",
      "into the sea, that it might not remain to be a stumbling-block to the\n",
      "Indians. When the heathen saw that the threats of the devil were not\n",
      "being carried out, their eyes were opened and they were very eager\n",
      "to be baptized. Great aid was received from an epidemic of smallpox\n",
      "which attacked a whole region. In this way the Lord took to himself\n",
      "many souls, especially of children; for there were many newly baptized\n",
      "in the province of Pangasinan and in that of Nueva Segovia.] Many of\n",
      "those who seemed to be near their end recovered after they received\n",
      "the water of baptism. All, therefore, came to be baptized, and the\n",
      "Lord, by means of those who recovered, gave authority to the baptism;\n",
      "while of the vast number who died baptized He peopled heaven with\n",
      "new angels. This brought great comfort to the missionaries, who,\n",
      "although worn out and greatly fatigued by going from house to house\n",
      "baptizing and confessing, and giving the sacraments to sick persons,\n",
      "saw their labors successful and rewarded by the sending to heaven of\n",
      "so many souls, and also by the strengthening of their hope that they\n",
      "should go to accompany those souls in glory; for it is not possible\n",
      "that these should not be grateful, and pray and strive to obtain\n",
      "salvation for those who labored, with such zeal, to give it to them\n",

      "[Soon after the provincial chapter, one of the definitors, father\n",
      "Fray Damian Balaguer, died. He had lived but a short time in the\n",
      "province, but had gained great reputation in it; and his early death\n",
      "was much mourned. He was a native of the kingdom of Valencia, and had\n",
      "two brothers in the same order--one, the present Fray Pedro Martyr de\n",
      "Balaguer; and the other master Fray Andres Balaguer, at one time bishop\n",
      "of Albarracin and afterward of Origuela. Father Fray Damian took the\n",
      "habit in the convent of the Preachers in Valencia, which has been happy\n",
      "in giving saints to the church. During all his novitiate, the master of\n",
      "the novices never had occasion to discipline him, even for the merest\n",
      "trifle--although by the advice of another father he assigned him some\n",
      "discipline, without any fault on the part of Fray Damian, but not\n",
      "without a cause; for it is necessary for the novices to be initiated\n",
      "in these punishments of the order, that they may not afterward be new\n",
      "and strange to them. He was constant in prayer and fasting, given to\n",
      "speaking of the things of God, and to mortification. For many years he\n",
      "was accustomed to repeat the whole of the Psalter of David daily, in\n",
      "imitation of St. Vincent of Ferrara. He studied at Origuela, becoming a\n",
      "lecturer in arts in the same college, and afterward in theology--having\n",
      "a singular grace given him to declare with clearness the gravest and\n",
      "most profound difficulties of this holy science. He was an excellent\n",
      "and a moving preacher, having the power to change the hearts of many\n",
      "of his hearers, who selected him as their spiritual guide. Whenever\n",
      "he left the convent, which he did only on important occasions, he\n",
      "was followed by a troop of his disciples, who gathered not only to\n",
      "honor him, but to profit by what they heard him say. He showed all\n",
      "his life the greatest humility, and from day to day did not change,\n",
      "except by the augmentation and advance of his virtue. Being eager for\n",
      "the conversion of souls, he went to Mexico with master Fray Alonso\n",
      "Bayllo, who was going out to Mexico with authority to divide the\n",
      "province of Vaxac from that of Santiago. [28] For the space of two\n",
      "years he directed the schools in the city of Vaxac; but, as that was\n",
      "not the end which he had intended, he was dissatisfied. When he heard\n",
      "that many ministers of the holy gospel were needed in the Philippinas,\n",
      "he took advantage of the arrival in Mexico of father Fray Francisco\n",
      "de Morales to ask that he would take him to the islands with the\n",
      "rest of the company whom he was bringing over. Arriving in 1598,\n",
      "he was assigned to Nueva Segovia, where in a short time he learned\n",
      "enough of the language to be able to hear confessions. Father Fray\n",
      "Damian was first vicar and superior of the mission of Abulug. As such,\n",
      "he was a definitor in the provincial chapter, and returned to Nueva\n",
      "Segovia as vicar of the village of Pata. He died greatly mourned.\n",

      "sanctity, a son of the convent of San Pablo at Sevilla, who came to\n",
      "these islands in the year 1594. He was of much use to the Indians,\n",
      "of whose language he learned enough to be understood by them and to\n",
      "teach them to pray, to attract the Christians to the church, and to\n",
      "teach the heathen the knowledge of the doctrine of Christianity. He\n",
      "was fervent in prayer, being often moved to sighs and tears during\n",
      "his devotions. He strove to hide them from his companion, father Fray\n",
      "Ambrosio de la Madre de Dios, but was unable to do so. Father Fray\n",
      "Ambrosio said to him that, as they two lived alone and like brothers,\n",
      "there was no reason why one should try to conceal anything from the\n",
      "other. With this permission from his superior he broke out in sobs,\n",
      "and his heart melted away in tears, directed mainly to the conversion\n",
      "of these heathen and to the perfecting in Christianity of the already\n",

      "day of St. Dominic, under such circumstances that there could be no\n",
      "doubt that the Lord had sent it to enable them properly to celebrate\n",
      "the feast of the holy founder of this order. The second event was\n",
      "the marvelous recovery or restoration to life, at the intercession of\n",
      "St. Dominic, of an Indian who had been given over for dead. It was the\n",
      "very man who had given them the fish. Father Fray Domingo died from\n",
      "exposure to the sun. He was sent back to the convent of Manila for\n",

      "\n",
      "The intermediate chapter; an extraordinary event which took place in\n",
      "it, and the coming of religious to the province.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the year of our Lord 1602, the voting fathers assembled in their\n",
      "intermediate provincial chapter, at which was accepted the house of\n",
      "San Juan del Monte, which is situated a legua from the city of Manila\n",
      "in a solitary place, a healthful and pleasant situation. There were\n",
      "two motives and ends with which this house was built. The first was\n",
      "the consideration that some aged fathers, after their many labors\n",
      "and years passed in the ministry, desired, having performed the\n",
      "duties of Martha, to give themselves up wholly to those of Mary by\n",
      "leading the life of contemplation. For this purpose the locality is\n",
      "very well suited, for there is nothing in it to disturb the calm of\n",
      "prayer and contemplation. But it did not serve much for this end,\n",
      "because it was soon found by experience that these servants of God,\n",
      "the aged ministers, were of much more usefulness in the ministries,\n",
      "since their example and authority were very efficacious for the\n",
      "spiritual increase of faith and devotion in the Indians. Teaching\n",
      "and doctrine were received much better from such venerable ministers,\n",
      "who were well known, loved, and regarded. It was also found that the\n",
      "example of these venerable fathers was of great use to those who\n",
      "had newly entered upon the ministry, since they could not fail to\n",
      "venerate and follow the acts and the teaching which they beheld in\n",
      "these ancient and venerable ministers. Even though there are some\n",
      "who on account of their great age and infirmity can not continue\n",
      "in the service, they are of more use in the convent of the city,\n",
      "where their infirmities may be better cared for, and where their\n",
      "good example and venerable age are more valuable. The second motive\n",
      "and object is one which is obviously of great advantage. It is found\n",
      "that in the city convalescence takes place slowly, or not at all;\n",
      "therefore those who are being treated for any sickness leave the city\n",
      "for their convalescence, by the advice of the physicians. If the order\n",
      "did not have this convent outside of the city, in a situation which\n",
      "is healthful and where the air is good--which is what convalescents\n",
      "most require--the religious would be obliged to ask for permission to\n",
      "go for their convalescence to the farms or fruit-gardens of laymen,\n",
      "which are never so appropriate as the convent. Now that they have this\n",
      "convent, no permission is granted to go for convalescence to any other\n",
      "place, which is to the great advantage of the province. Also when a\n",
      "religious is worn out and afflicted by the heats of the city, which\n",
      "are very great, he is permitted to go and obtain some refreshment and\n",
      "ease at San Juan del Monte, and soon returns to his labors in the city\n",
      "with new energy; and this, too, is of great value. While the fathers\n",
      "were assembled at this chapter an event occurred which caused special\n",
      "awe in the hearts of the religious, and created greater respect for\n",
      "the sacred constitutions which we promise to observe. Even when the\n",
      "obligation does not involve a matter of sin, even venial sin, still\n",
      "the Lord desires us to keep them with the greatest accuracy--not\n",
      "only in matters of importance, but even in the less significant\n",
      "ones. It was a very extraordinary incident, and one which seems\n",
      "to have happened like the blindness of the man who was born blind,\n",
      "as the gospel tells us, \"not because of his own sins nor those of\n",
      "his fathers, but for the glory of God.\" Although there was a fault,\n",
      "it was such a fault as the Lord is accustomed to pass over (and even\n",
      "greater ones) in us. Therefore it was, as I said, that it seemed to\n",
      "be for the greater glory of God and of St. Cecilia, who, as we shall\n",
      "see, had a share in the remedy. There was a religious who came from\n",
      "the province of Andalucia, in which he had lived in a very devout\n",
      "convent. It happened one evening that this religious ate between meals\n",
      "a few capers without the permission and blessing of the superior. This\n",
      "is something which in the eyes of men did not appear a special fault;\n",
      "but it was so in the sight of God, who punished this excess. From that\n",
      "evening the religious suffered from a pain, which seemed to him to be\n",
      "in his heart. Although from evening to evening it sometimes was very\n",
      "severe, still it was not of such a nature that on account of it they\n",
      "hesitated to ordain him, or, after he was ordained, prohibited him\n",
      "from the use of the orders which he had received. He came into these\n",
      "regions, and went as minister to the Indians in Pangasinan. In the\n",
      "course of time his sufferings increased, and afflicted him to such an\n",
      "extent that he was prohibited from saying mass, as it was feared that\n",
      "the malady would attack him during the celebration. During this time\n",
      "when he did not celebrate mass, his malady continually increased and\n",
      "afflicted him more than before, so that the religious suffered great\n",
      "torture; and they gave him great care, and as much comfort as was\n",
      "consistent with our poverty. In spite of this he grew worse and worse,\n",
      "and suffered greater afflictions and torments. It attacked him one day,\n",
      "and they gave him some relics. Thereupon he began to be so furious that\n",
      "he lifted up and carried along the religious who came to hold him. It\n",
      "seemed to them that it was some evil spirit which received the holy\n",
      "thing so ill. The prior at that time, who was father Fray Francisco\n",
      "de Morales, afterward a holy martyr in Japon, asked permission of the\n",
      "father provincial to exorcise him. While he was saying the litany,\n",
      "the grimaces and gestures made by the afflicted man were many; but\n",
      "when the prior reached the glorious name of the martyr St. Cecilia,\n",
      "his fury became so great that with the torment of it he fell to the\n",
      "ground, deprived of strength as if in a faint. Now it happened that\n",
      "this religious was very devoted to this most illustrious saint, and\n",
      "had composed a special office which he used to recite out of devotion\n",
      "to her. He had even abandoned his own proper surname, and was called\n",
      "and called himself \"de Sancta Cecilia.\" Although he did not perceive it\n",
      "himself, this was of great aid to him against the devil who tormented\n",
      "him; therefore it was that the evil spirit resented it so much when\n",
      "the religious invoked her. When the religious saw this, they called\n",
      "upon her many times, and all those present made a vow to fast for a\n",
      "day on bread and water, from reverence for this saint. The provincial\n",
      "vowed to celebrate a feast in her honor, and the church and an altar\n",
      "were prepared for saying a mass to her with great solemnity. All the\n",
      "religious were with the afflicted friar in the choir, singing the\n",
      "mass to the saint. At the first Kyrie, he began to be changed; and,\n",
      "when the priest said the first prayer, the noise which he made in\n",
      "the choir was so great that he disturbed the ministers who were at\n",
      "the altar. While they were singing in the creed the words Ex Maria\n",
      "Virgine, et <DW25> factus est [of the Virgin Mary and was made man]\n",
      "the noise became very much greater; and at the lifting up of the Host\n",
      "his sobs and groans and cries were so loud that, to avoid exciting\n",
      "the people in the church, they kept sounding clarions to the end of\n",
      "the mass. They took him from the choir to the oratory. Here in the\n",
      "presence of all the religious gathered together, he performed an act\n",
      "of humility, saying that his faults had brought him to this wretched\n",
      "state, and begging them to pray to God to pardon him; and that, if\n",
      "it was best for him to suffer all the pains of hell, he was ready to\n",
      "receive them. He asked permission of the provincial to kiss the feet\n",
      "of those who were present. The provincial comforted him, and they went\n",
      "on with the exorcism, during which the devil became calmer. The friar\n",
      "answered all the questions which were put to him, and, when they gave\n",
      "him the holy cross, he kissed it with reverence. These were evidences\n",
      "of his recovery. The friar became so weary that it was necessary for\n",
      "him to repose. When he lay down to sleep it seemed to him, whether\n",
      "in dreams or not he could not tell, that the devil complained of\n",
      "being suffocated, that a religious was repeating exorcisms to him,\n",
      "and that the glorious St. Cecilia came to his assistance. On the\n",
      "following day the religious fasted, as they had promised, on bread\n",
      "and water, and repeated the exorcisms. During them it became evident\n",
      "that the evil guest had departed, and that he must be one of those of\n",
      "whom the Lord said that they are not to be cast out except by fasting\n",
      "and prayer. There was no more necessity of cure for that malady. As a\n",
      "result, the religious became very much devoted to this glorious saint,\n",
      "who has favored the order on many other occasions; and they became\n",
      "very fearful of violating the constitutions, when they saw that the\n",
      "Lord was zealous for them in such a manner. Among the babblings which\n",
      "the Father of Lies muttered through the mouth of the afflicted friar,\n",
      "it was noticed that when he was directed to read the epistle in\n",
      "the mass of the cross, where the apostle says, Christus factus est\n",
      "pro nobis obediens usque ad mortem, [29] he read pro vobis [i.e.,\n",
      "\"for your sake\"], excluding the devils from the benefit of the holy\n",
      "Passion. When one of those present said that Christ our Lord had not\n",
      "died for devils, the proud one answered immediately: \"Then we have the\n",
      "less to be thankful for.\" When he reached the words of the apostle,\n",
      "that \"at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow, of those who are in\n",
      "heaven, on earth, and in the hells,\" he refused to utter this last\n",
      "word, which affects the devils; and, when they forced him to utter\n",
      "it, he answered that it was enough to say that every tongue should\n",
      "confess that He was seated at the right hand of the Father. All this\n",
      "was to continue further the pride with which he was always tormented.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, at the end of April, those religious reached\n",
      "Manila whom father Fray Diego de Soria had collected in Espana\n",
      "during the previous year. He assembled them at the port, where he\n",
      "delivered them to father Fray Thomas Hernandez, [30] father Fray\n",
      "Diego remaining in Espana to collect and conduct another company,\n",
      "in which he succeeded. The body of friars which arrived at this time\n",
      "was one of the best which had come to this province. [31] It contained\n",
      "fourteen members from the colleges of the provinces of Espana, Aragon\n",
      "and Romana. These were all very superior in ability and advanced in\n",
      "knowledge, and still more so in religion and virtue. The provinces\n",
      "of Espana were not a little grieved to lose them. There, however,\n",
      "there was a very easy remedy because of the many who were left behind;\n",
      "while for this province these friars were of the greatest value, and\n",
      "have given it dignity and support in various ways, in the offices that\n",
      "belong to it. It appeared from the beginning that the Lord gave them\n",
      "His benediction, and such a spirit of constancy and firmness that,\n",
      "although they had the most urgent reasons for remaining behind, not one\n",
      "of those who were designated failed to come. This is something which\n",
      "probably never happened with any other shipload. There also came many\n",
      "besides [the fourteen above mentioned], taking the chance as to their\n",
      "being desired, which was an even greater marvel. This was in the year\n",
      "sixty-one, when Sevilla was afflicted with the plague. It was here\n",
      "that the religious were to assemble, and to wait for the sailing of\n",
      "the fleet. On the road, they met many who asked them where they were\n",
      "going. When they answered, \"To Sevilla,\" those that heard them were\n",
      "amazed and answered: \"You see, fathers, that we, who are inhabitants\n",
      "of Sevilla, have abandoned our houses and our fortunes almost to\n",
      "destruction, fleeing from the plague there. Are your Reverences going\n",
      "to place yourselves in the midst of it?\" But nothing sufficed to\n",
      "prevent a single one of them from continuing his journey, for they\n",
      "regarded dying in such an enterprise as good fortune, and death on\n",
      "such a journey as happy. At the court father Fray Thomas Hernandez\n",
      "and three companions who were with him found the father provincial\n",
      "of Espana, who at that time was the father master Fray Andres de\n",
      "Caso, an intimate friend of him who at that time was president of\n",
      "the Indias. He said to them, \"Where are you going? There is no fleet,\n",
      "for the president of the Indias has told me so.\" In spite of all this,\n",
      "the religious were all moved by a higher impulse; and although it was\n",
      "true that, on account of the plague, it had been ordered that there\n",
      "should be no fleet, one was afterward permitted to sail. The religious\n",
      "reached Sevilla after much hardship; because in many places they were\n",
      "unwilling to admit them to the towns, or to private houses, or even\n",
      "to our own convents, so great was the fear of the plague. They were\n",
      "even unwilling to be satisfied with the evidence that the religious\n",
      "brought with them that they were healthy. When they reached Sevilla\n",
      "they saw the plague-stricken taken almost dead to the hospitals and\n",
      "even this did not frighten them. They were in the Guerta del Corco\n",
      "[i.e., \"garden of the deer\"]; and there one of them was taken with the\n",
      "plague, and was carried suddenly off in two more days. Even then, not\n",
      "one of them even thought of giving up the voyage, although they saw\n",
      "the plague and death within the house where they were dwelling. The\n",
      "Lord favored them so that no one else took the plague. When they saw\n",
      "the danger more clearly, they gave greater thanks to Him who had not\n",
      "only rescued them from it, but had taken from them the fear which\n",
      "they naturally had of it--especially as they had almost all come on\n",
      "foot, asking alms, all the way from the innermost parts of Castilla\n",
      "la Vieja; and though they were persons who were not inured to that\n",
      "sort of hardship, and therefore were the more likely to fall sick,\n",
      "especially in a season of plague. [The religious who died was Fray\n",
      "Juan de Solis, a son of the licentiate Jofre de Solis. He was a\n",
      "man of jovial disposition and fond of company, but corrected his\n",
      "weakness when he proposed to go to the Philippinas. His relatives and\n",
      "several of his fellow-friars tried to dissuade him, but he insisted\n",
      "upon going. In Sevilla, as there was no lay religious with them, he\n",
      "undertook the duty of cooking for the rest of the company; and it may\n",
      "be that the great heat and consequent exhaustion were the reasons for\n",
      "his being taken by the plague.] When the religious reached Sevilla,\n",
      "they were received with much joy and charity by father Fray Diego\n",
      "de Soria. Everything they had--their books, their clothes, their\n",
      "money, and everything, down to their very handkerchiefs--all became\n",
      "common property; if they had any debts unpaid, the community took\n",
      "charge of these, and the religious were left without any care, and\n",
      "even without the use of anything for themselves, except the habit\n",
      "which they wore. From that day they even said all their masses for\n",
      "the community, which provided for every one what he had need of,\n",
      "while no one possessed anything (not even by permission) except\n",
      "books. Everything else was in common for all of them; and hence they\n",
      "did not have to think of carrying anything with them for the voyage,\n",
      "except the very small outfit provided for the whole company. [On the\n",
      "voyage they strove to live as much as possible as if they were in a\n",
      "very strict convent. They encountered a frightful storm, so great that\n",
      "there was not a single vessel which did not lose at least one mast;\n",
      "and one of the largest and best of the vessels foundered, although\n",
      "without loss of life. Even the pilots confessed, which they avoid as\n",
      "much as possible for fear of disheartening the crew. The ship on which\n",
      "the religious were was very old, and was being sent on its last voyage,\n",
      "to be broken up and sold as old lumber in the port. In response to a\n",
      "vow of the religious, the Virgin of the Rosary showed them grace, and\n",
      "brought the storm to an end. In Mexico some were sick, but none died;\n",
      "and not one remained behind. This greatly astonished the fathers of\n",
      "the province of Mexico, because in every shipload some give up the\n",
      "distant mission--being wearied by the voyage which they have taken,\n",
      "fearful of the dangers to come, and pleased with the delightful climate\n",
      "of Mexico. This shipload was the first which occupied the hospice\n",
      "of St. Hyacinth, where they lived as if in a convent, following\n",
      "all the rules of the province. While in the hospice, they studied\n",
      "and had frequent theological conferences. They very rarely visited\n",
      "the city. On the journey from Mexico to Acapulco, which is very long\n",
      "and over a very bad road, many of them went on foot. As this was not\n",
      "customary at that time, it greatly edified those who saw them. There\n",
      "was only one ship in from the Philippinas; and this and more were\n",
      "needed by the governor, Don Pedro de Acuna, for the accommodation\n",
      "of himself and his troops. But while the religious were praying and\n",
      "offering vows to the Virgin for her aid, they were rejoiced by the\n",
      "news that one ship had come in from the Philippinas and two from Peru,\n",
      "which were all taken to make up the fleet. On the voyage they did much\n",
      "for the consciences of those who were in their ship, dividing among\n",
      "themselves all the people, from the admiral and his companions down\n",
      "to the lowest convict or ship-boy. They taught these men and heard\n",
      "their confessions, opening the way of peace and liberty to many a\n",
      "captive and unhappy soul. At the port of Acapulco died father Fray\n",
      "Vicente de Liano, a religious of much devotion and patience under\n",
      "suffering, for he was a confirmed invalid. When they reached Manila\n",
      "they were immediately distributed by the provincial council, which\n",
      "was then sitting. The number of religious was the largest that has\n",
      "entered the province since its establishment. All of the houses in\n",
      "the province were filled, and enough were left to comply with the\n",
      "wishes of the king of Satzuma, who had sent to ask for religious.]\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "[Christianity in the kingdoms of Japon took its origin from the\n",
      "Society of Jesus, the first preacher and apostle therein being\n",
      "St. Francis Xavier. The fathers of this Society had entered Japon\n",
      "according to the rule of the gospel, without weapons or soldiers, but\n",
      "with peace and mercy and in the strength of holy living. Christianity\n",
      "flourished so that the first missionaries were obliged to call in aid;\n",
      "and they sent for assistance to the Philippinas, where at that time\n",
      "there were discalced Franciscans and Augustinians, besides members of\n",
      "the Society. Father Gaspar Coello, vice-provincial of the fathers in\n",
      "Japon, wrote to the governor, Dr. Santiago de Vera, to the bishop,\n",
      "Don Fray Domingo de Salacar, and to the guardian of St. Francis,\n",
      "and the rector of the Society in Manila, urging the establishment of\n",
      "trade between the Philippinas and Japon. The bishop made a number of\n",
      "formal inquiries, which were verified before a notary. One is dated\n",
      "at Nangasaqui, September 11, 1584; and the other from the kingdom\n",
      "of Fixen, January 24, 1585. The witnesses when asked especially if\n",
      "it would be an advantage to have religious of various orders, and\n",
      "especially religious under the vow of poverty, replied unanimously\n",
      "that such would be very well received. They called to witness the\n",
      "case of the holy Fray Juan Pobre, a discalced friar who disembarked\n",
      "in Japon on his way to China, and whom the Japanese, both heathen and\n",
      "Christian, adored. It must be admitted that soon afterward the fathers\n",
      "of the Society in Japon changed their opinion, in spite of the fact\n",
      "that the extension of Christianity in Japon required more laborers in\n",
      "the field and that the empire was large enough for all the religious\n",
      "orders. God was pleased to put it into the heart of many of the kings,\n",
      "or tonos, of that realm to send to Manila to ask for religious of all\n",
      "the orders. The particular reason for the calling of our religious was\n",
      "as follows: In 1601 a number of Japanese vessels, with many Christians\n",
      "on them, touched at Manila. A number of these Christians became very\n",
      "fond of our convent, and often visited it. One of them, by name Juan\n",
      "Sandaya, brought the captain of his ship to the prior, Fray Francisco\n",
      "de Morales; and they discussed the possibility of sending religious\n",
      "of the Order of St. Dominic to Satzuma, whence the captain came. In\n",
      "the following year a letter was brought from the king of Satzuma,\n",
      "Tintionguen, inviting them to come to his kingdom. The letter was\n",
      "dated on the twenty-second day of the ninth month in the sixth year\n",
      "of Keycho. [32] In response to it religious were sent. Father Fray\n",
      "Francisco de Morales went as vicar and superior, accompanied by the\n",
      "fathers Fray Thomas Hernandez, Fray Alonso de Mena, and Fray Thomas del\n",
      "Spiritu Santo, or Zumarraga, and brother Fray Juan de la Abadia, a lay\n",
      "brother. [33] They set sail on the day of the most holy Trinity. They\n",
      "carried but little in the way of temporal things, expecting to live\n",
      "upon the alms which they should receive in Japon. They rested the first\n",
      "night in a heathen temple in the island of Coxiqui. [34] The priest of\n",
      "the idols removed the images, and left the temple unoccupied, and the\n",
      "fathers consecrated it and set up in it an altar. The Japanese were\n",
      "very curious about the new missionaries, and were greatly pleased with\n",
      "them. They were welcomed in a few days by some Japanese gentlemen,\n",
      "who made them a very ceremonious greeting and welcomed them in the\n",
      "name of their king. They were escorted to the court of the tono, where\n",
      "they were honorably received. The black and white colors of the habit\n",
      "pleased the Japanese, for these are customary in that country; while\n",
      "the eating of fish as an ordinary article of food is very common in\n",
      "Japon. They also greatly admired the devotion of the fathers to study,\n",
      "for they esteem their boncos [or \"bonzes\"] in proportion as they are\n",
      "learned; but what above all they admired was the contempt of these\n",
      "fathers for comforts and worldly advantages. The favor with which\n",
      "the religious were received enraged the priests of the idols, who\n",
      "insisted that the Japanese princes who had become Christians had been\n",
      "unfortunate. They mentioned the instance of Don Augustin Tzunotami,\n",
      "[35] a great and valiant lord who had been destroyed by the emperor;\n",
      "also that of Don Francisco, the king of Bungo, [36] who had been\n",
      "conquered and lost his life; while this kingdom of Satzuma had been\n",
      "protected by its devotion to its gods, and especially to Faquiman,\n",
      "who is their god of war. It was no wonder that two Christian princes\n",
      "should have been overwhelmed when thousands of heathen had suffered\n",
      "the same overthrow, but the idol priests passed that over. The emperor\n",
      "intervened, and enacted a decree that no king or tono, and not even\n",
      "any gentleman of distinction, should become a Christian. The king\n",
      "of Satzuma, however, would not banish the religious, but gave them\n",
      "permission to build a church and a house. Not infrequently, however,\n",
      "they were forgotten, and did not receive their customary supply of\n",
      "rice. The fathers converted the family of the man in whose house they\n",
      "lived, and made a chapel in the oratory of the house. The queen was\n",
      "desirous of seeing the image of the Virgin which was set up in the\n",
      "chapel; and it was carried to the palace, and there worshiped with\n",
      "the greatest respect by the chief personages of the court. The king,\n",
      "being unable to make up his mind how to treat the religious because\n",
      "of the opposition of the emperor, permitted them, at their request,\n",
      "to return to the island of Quoxiqui, where they had landed, and\n",
      "where they had something of an establishment. Here they suffered\n",
      "from the rigors of the Japanese winter in a wretched hut. They had\n",
      "insufficient food, and received very small alms. In case of illness,\n",
      "it was impossible to give the sick man any treatment, or even proper\n",
      "food. The Lord, however, preserved them; and the tono at last, pitying\n",
      "them and being edified by their way of living, offered them a town,\n",
      "the income derived from which would suffice to maintain them. This\n",
      "they declined, as being against the rule of the province to which they\n",
      "belonged. The king was much amazed, and gave them some interpreters\n",
      "to speak for them when they preached. Being on an island seven leguas\n",
      "at sea, they could not preach to advantage, or learn the language;\n",
      "the king gave them permission to build a house and a church in the\n",
      "city of Quiodomari. They said their first mass here on the day of\n",
      "the Visitation of the Virgin Mary in 1606. Here the fathers made a\n",
      "number of conversions, although they were permitted to baptize only\n",
      "the common people, the conversion of persons of rank or of soldiers\n",
      "being forbidden. Some, however, came secretly and were baptized. One\n",

      "In Espana many times the conquest of Camboja, Sian, and Champan,\n",
      "neighboring kingdoms, was much discussed. The theologians whom his\n",
      "Majesty consulted declared that this conquest was justified within\n",
      "certain limitations. As captain-general was appointed the Conde de\n",
      "Bailen. There came to Manila in 1603 an embassy from the new king\n",
      "[of Camboja] asking for the friendship of the governor, for a force\n",
      "of soldiers, and, most important of all, for religious to come and\n",
      "preach the gospel. The king disclaimed any part in the murders which\n",
      "had been committed a few years before by the king his predecessor (who\n",
      "was his nephew), and by the Malay Moros whom that king favored. By\n",
      "them all the Portuguese and Castilians who were there had been slain,\n",
      "except one who made his escape. [37] This new king had had nothing\n",
      "to do with that murder, because he was at the time a prisoner and\n",
      "captive in Sian, and had been taken from prison there to the kingdom\n",
      "at the death of his nephew, who had been slain by the Malay Moros\n",
      "whom he had favored. They had taken possession of the kingdom,\n",
      "thus rewarding the ungrateful treachery which he had shown to the\n",
      "Spaniards, although they had restored him to his kingdom. At this time\n",
      "the governor of these islands was Don Pedro de Acuna, a man of noble\n",
      "birth and a brave soldier, a devoted servant of his Majesty, and a\n",
      "true Christian. In this same year the Lord had given him a glorious\n",
      "victory over fifteen or sixteen thousand Chinese who attacked this\n",
      "city, of whom scarcely one was left alive, the Lord aiding this noble\n",
      "gentleman and the few Spaniards who were in Manila. Not long afterward\n",
      "He gave him the great victory by which Maluco was recovered and given\n",
      "into the possession of his Majesty, without the loss of a man, which\n",
      "greatly enhanced the victory. [The governor was delighted by this\n",
      "embassy from Camboja, and sent to ask preachers of the order which\n",
      "had spent so much and labored so hard to introduce the gospel among\n",
      "these tribes. The province immediately appointed father Fray Inigo\n",
      "de Santa Maria as vicar, and, as associates and apostolic preachers,\n",
      "father Fray Geronimo de Belen [38] and father Fray Alonso Collar, or\n",
      "de Santa Cathalina--whom the governor despatched with six Spaniards,\n",
      "letters, and a present, in a good frigate. They had bad weather,\n",
      "and were obliged to touch at Cochinchina and to coast along the\n",
      "kingdom of Champan, where they were attacked by Indians when they\n",
      "went on shore to get fresh water. They reached the port of Camboja\n",
      "called Chordemuco, in April. The king received them with great marks\n",
      "of honor, showing particular favor to the religious. The kingdom\n",
      "was in constant disturbance, but the king was greatly encouraged\n",
      "even by the presence of these Spaniards. He was greatly desirous of\n",
      "receiving further assistance from the Philippinas; but the fathers\n",
      "were doubtful whether any ought to come, for fear that things would\n",
      "turn out as they had before. Some vessels came from Cochinchina, the\n",
      "captain of one of them being one of those Sangleys who had killed the\n",
      "governor of the Philippinas (Dasmarinas); he took possession of the\n",
      "Spanish galley, and became a pirate. He had at this time the title of\n",
      "ambassador from the king of Cochinchina. Some of the Japanese knew him,\n",
      "since he had stolen a ship from them; and they wished to kill him,\n",
      "but were restrained by the religious. Soon after, when some more\n",
      "Japanese vessels came into port, they plotted against the man, and\n",
      "took his life, before the fathers could hinder them. At this time the\n",
      "fathers and the Spaniards suffered great risks, because the Siamese,\n",

      "one of the fathers to go to Manila and to ask for reenforcements\n",
      "of soldiers and for more fathers, promising to pay the soldiers,\n",
      "who might defend and guard those who were converted. Father Fray\n",
      "Inigo went back for that purpose. The priests, or boncos, frequented\n",
      "our church and approved our manner of life, giving hopes of their\n",
      "conversion if the religious should remain. Some conversions were made,\n",
      "and the manner of life of the fathers greatly impressed all the people\n",
      "of the city. On his way back to Manila, father Fray Ynigo lost his\n",
      "life. He was a son of San Estevan at Salamanca, and was almost one\n",
      "of the first who came to this province, having been sent as a result\n",
      "of the activity of the first bishop of these islands, and of his\n",
      "associate, Fray Miguel de Venavides. He was a great preacher and\n",
      "very devout in prayer. He was elected to the priory of Manila, and\n",
      "was most useful in enlightening the consciences of the inhabitants\n",
      "of that city. He was most devoted to St. Cecilia and to St. Ursula;\n",
      "and when he called upon their names, miracles were wrought for him\n",
      "by the supplying of a convent in Pangasinan with fish at his prayers,\n",
      "and on other occasions. He showed at some times the spirit of prophecy.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time there died in Camboja father Fray Alonso Collar or\n",
      "de Sancta Cathalina. Father Fray Alonso was a native of Cangas de\n",
      "Tineo, and assumed the habit and professed in Oviedo. He had come\n",
      "to the province in the previous year (1602), and after beginning\n",
      "to learn the Chinese language, had been sent by the order of his\n",
      "superior on this expedition. His death caused great grief in Camboja,\n",
      "and his funeral was attended like that of one of the grandees of the\n",
      "nation. His bones were afterwards taken to Manila, that he might be\n",
      "buried with his brethren. Thus there remained in Camboja, in the\n",
      "midst of many and great perils, one single religious (Jeronimo de\n",
      "Belen), who dared not baptize the people, although he had the license\n",
      "of the king to do so, because of the confusion and disquiet of the\n",
      "time. Looking for no future success, and knowing the fickleness of\n",
      "the Indians of that region--who had asked to have missionaries and\n",
      "soldiers sent to them, and who then had received them so ill, and\n",
      "had finally killed them--he wrote back asking permission to return;\n",
      "this was granted him by the provincial, until such time as the affairs\n",

      "the world. It is of great strength, being almost surrounded by the\n",
      "sea and by a large river, which wash its walls. It is the capital and\n",
      "court city of these islands, where the governor and captain-general\n",
      "of them has his residence, as well as the royal Audiencia and\n",
      "Chancilleria. Here is situated the largest garrison of soldiers,\n",
      "with its master-of-camp, sargento-mayor, and captains. From here are\n",
      "sent out the forces and garrisons subject to this government, which\n",
      "are very many and very wide-spread, for it includes Maluco and the\n",
      "island of Hermosa--one of them almost under the torrid zone, and the\n",
      "other almost within view of Great China and very near Japon. This\n",
      "city makes the name of Espana renowned and feared throughout all\n",
      "these neighboring kingdoms; for, although its inhabitants and its\n",
      "soldiers are few, yet by the aid of the Lord, whose faith they spread\n",
      "abroad, they have performed so many glorious exploits that even the\n",
      "barbarians of the smallest capacity have come to esteem above measure\n",
      "their greatness, when they see the Spaniards always victorious over\n",
      "enemies who so surpass them in number that experience only might make\n",
      "such victories credible. As a kind father with his son, whose good he\n",
      "desires, not only strives to give him honor and wealth, but in time\n",
      "provides him with punishment and discipline, therefore, after our Lord\n",
      "had made the city illustrious with glorious victories and had filled\n",

      "upon it a fire which, defying all efforts to control it, burned to the\n",
      "ground a third part of the city--with such swiftness that many had no\n",
      "opportunity to escape it (although the fire occurred about midday),\n",
      "and they perished in the flames; while the loss of wealth was so\n",
      "great that it can hardly be believed. Hearing the news of the fire,\n",
      "which was at some distance from our convent, the religious went to\n",
      "help extinguish it; for on such occasions as this they labor more\n",
      "and have more confidence than others. In a moment, as if it were\n",
      "flying, the fire reached our convent; and since there was no one\n",
      "to protect it, it was almost wholly burnt, the Lord leaving only so\n",
      "much as was necessary to supply a crowded shelter for the religious,\n",
      "without being obliged to go to the house of any other person. In\n",
      "this we were among the more fortunate who escaped; for the fire was\n",
      "so extensive that others had not even this small comfort. Many who\n",
      "on that morning were rich, and had great houses and great wealth,\n",
      "had that night no house where they might lodge or shelter themselves,\n",
      "such is at times the fury of this terrible element.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the beginning of October in this same year, this city, and\n",
      "consequently all the islands, were in great danger of being lost,\n",
      "because of a revolt against it of the Chinese who lived near it. The\n",
      "event happened in the following way. In the previous year, in one of\n",
      "the merchant vessels which come to this city from China every year\n",
      "there arrived three persons of authority, who are called by the\n",
      "Spaniards \"mandarins.\" These are their judges or leading officers\n",
      "in war. They entered the city, borne on men's shoulders, on gilded\n",
      "ivory seats, having the insignia of magistracy: and they were received\n",
      "with the display due to ambassadors of so powerful a king. They had\n",
      "come to search for a mountain which a Chinese, named Tiongong, had\n",
      "described to his king as being all gold. The name of this mountain\n",
      "was Cavite, and from it he promised to bring back to China ships\n",
      "laden with gold. The mandarins made their investigations, for which\n",
      "purpose they carried Tiongong with them; and when they reached the\n",
      "place which he described, they found no mountain of gold, nor any\n",
      "sign of one. When they accused him of fraud and deceit, he answered,\n",
      "\"If you wish it to be gold, it is gold\" (referring to the ornaments\n",
      "which the Indians wear, and much more to the wealth of the Spaniards);\n",
      "\"if you wish it to be sand, it is sand.\" All this was done in the sight\n",
      "of the Spaniards, who came there with a good deal of interest to know\n",
      "the reason why these mandarins had come so far away from their regular\n",
      "duties--and especially their chief, who was, as it were, sargento-mayor\n",
      "of the province of Chincheo, one of the most prominent officers in\n",
      "their army. The whole thing aroused suspicion; and the archbishop,\n",
      "Don Fray Miguel de Venavides, a friar of our habit and a religious\n",
      "of this province, urged the governor to send them back immediately,\n",
      "that they might not perceive how small a force the Spaniards had,\n",
      "and might not make the other reconnoissances which are customary\n",
      "when foreign cities or kingdoms are to be attacked. They feared that\n",
      "China was intending an attack upon us. The religious of the order,\n",
      "as they knew the language, visited the mandarins and learned from them\n",
      "that this Tiongong meant to inform the king that the wealth of these\n",
      "islands in the hands of Spaniards and Indians was great; and that,\n",
      "if he would send ships and forces, he might easily make himself lord\n",
      "of it all. They accordingly urged the governor to hasten sending\n",
      "the mandarins away, and he did so. After this event the Spaniards\n",
      "did not rest secure, but were very fearful that the king of China,\n",
      "being a heathen, might be carried away by avarice, and might be greedy\n",
      "for the great wealth which this trickster offered him. Since he was\n",
      "a very powerful king, his resources would certainly be greater than\n",
      "this country could resist without great damage to itself. Even if the\n",
      "city were to be victorious, the result would be its destruction. It\n",
      "would lose a great many of its people, and the indignation of the\n",
      "king would be aroused because of his defeat. He would therefore\n",
      "take away their commerce from them, without which this country could\n",
      "not be sustained. All these reasonings and considerations made the\n",
      "Spaniards very anxious and suspicious. Their suspicions were very\n",
      "greatly increased when the heathen Chinese kept saying that they\n",
      "believed a fleet would come the next year. This was heard by some\n",
      "Chinese Christians who were so in truth; and they went immediately\n",
      "and told it to our religious who had the direction of them. There\n",
      "were some of them who put on false hair that they might look like\n",
      "heathen, and went with studied negligence to the alcaiceria [i.e.,\n",
      "\"silk market\"] where the heathen lived, and heard their conversations\n",
      "at night with reference to the coming of the fleet. They immediately\n",
      "reported these things to their religious, and they to the governor\n",
      "and the archbishop. The archbishop, in a sermon preached at the feast\n",
      "of the most holy Sacrament in our convent, informed the governor and\n",
      "the city that they ought to make preparations, because the Chinese\n",
      "were about to rebel. Although the governor knew all these things,\n",
      "because he had been told of them by our religious, on the aforesaid\n",
      "authority, he could never be persuaded that the Chinese were going to\n",
      "rebel, because of the great harm and the little or no advantage which\n",
      "they would receive from the revolt. Yet, to make ready for what might\n",
      "happen, he began to show special kindness to the Japanese who lived\n",
      "near Manila, and to prepare them so that in case of necessity they\n",
      "might be on the side of the Spaniards. He followed the same plan with\n",
      "the Indians, directing them to prepare themselves with arms and arrows,\n",
      "to be ready if they should be needed. None of this was conceded from\n",
      "the Chinese, for it could not be kept secret from so many; and they\n",
      "even heard with their own ears the most prominent people in Manila say:\n",
      "\"We cannot go out against the Chinese, if they come with a fleet,\n",
      "and leave behind us such a multitude as there is around the city;\n",
      "so, if we have news that there is a fleet of the Chinese, we shall\n",
      "have to kill all there are here, and go out and meet those who are\n",
      "coming.\" This kind of talk greatly afflicted them; and besides this,\n",
      "the more ignorant class of people already began to look at them as\n",
      "enemies, and treated them very badly. The result was that they became\n",
      "very much disquieted and fearful. In addition, there were not lacking\n",
      "some to go and tell them lies, bidding them be on their guard, for on\n",
      "such and such a day the Spaniards were going to break out upon them. In\n",
      "proof of this lie they called their attention to some facts which the\n",
      "Sangleys could see--for instance, that all the Spaniards were getting\n",
      "ready their weapons, and the Indians were making new ones, though\n",
      "they had no other enemies, unless it were the Chinese. At last, more\n",
      "out of fear than from any purpose of their own, they rose in revolt,\n",
      "insomuch that some of them were seen to go where others had fortified\n",
      "themselves, weeping bitterly because they saw their destruction,\n",
      "but feeling that there was no other means to save their lives. The\n",
      "governor and the Audiencia made great efforts to undeceive them and\n",
      "to pacify them, but nothing that was done gave them any security. On\n",
      "the contrary, it seemed to them a trick to catch them unawares. It\n",
      "was a pity to see them leave their houses, which were many, and flee\n",
      "without knowing where, or considering how they were to obtain food\n",
      "for so great a multitude. Some of them in this affliction hanged\n",
      "themselves, to avoid the miseries which as they saw would befall\n",
      "them if they revolted, and the violent death which they feared if\n",
      "they did not rise. Finally, on the eve of the glorious St. Francis,\n",
      "they threw off the mask and came forward as declared rebels against\n",
      "the city. Sounding warlike music and waving banners, they began to\n",
      "burn houses and to kill people; and on that night they attacked in a\n",
      "body the town of Binondo, which is composed of Christians of their\n",
      "own nation. Their purpose was to force these to join them; but our\n",
      "religious, to whom the teaching of these Chinese was committed, caused\n",
      "the women and children to be brought for protection to the church,\n",
      "while the Chinese Christians took their arms and defended the town\n",
      "under the leadership of the good knight Don Luis Perez das Marinas,\n",
      "who lived there next our church. With twenty arquebusiers, who were\n",
      "on guard in that town, they drove the enemy back without suffering\n",
      "any damage. The enemy, however, inflicted injury upon those who were\n",
      "at work in the fields, many of whom were taken by surprise and were\n",
      "compelled to join them or to suffer death. They also attacked the\n",
      "church and town of Tondo, which belongs to the religious of our father\n",
      "St. Augustine. As the latter had provided against them by a Spanish\n",
      "guard, they did no harm. After having defended the town all night,\n",
      "Don Luis das Marinas sent one of our religious to the governor before\n",
      "daylight, asking for some troops to attack the Chinese rebels who had\n",
      "fortified themselves near the town of Tondo, not far from Manila. He\n",
      "was of the opinion that as these people had spent all the night,\n",
      "disturbed themselves and disturbing others, they would be tired and\n",
      "sleepy, so that it would be easy to inflict great losses on them. The\n",
      "governor took the matter before a council of war; all approved, and\n",
      "he sent his nephew, Don Thomas de Acuna, with more than a hundred men,\n",
      "the best in the camp, together with some of the men of highest rank in\n",
      "the city, who desired to accompany the nephews of the governor and the\n",
      "archbishop, who went with this party. This small force was regarded\n",
      "as sufficient to attack more than six thousand who were said to have\n",
      "banded together and to be in fortifications--so little did they regard\n",
      "the Chinese. The Spanish, marching in good order, met at least three\n",
      "hundred Chinese enemies, and, attacking them, put them immediately to\n",
      "flight. They were near some large plantations of sugar-cane, in which\n",
      "the Chinese concealed themselves; and the Spaniards followed them,\n",
      "being thus divided and brought into disorder. The rebels were posted\n",
      "not far from there, and, when they saw the Spaniards in disorder,\n",
      "they all sallied out against them, and, surrounding them, killed\n",
      "them almost to a man, although with great loss on their own side. As\n",
      "a result, they plucked up courage to advance against the city, and\n",
      "to try to make an entry into it. For this purpose they made some\n",
      "machines of wood, much higher than the wall. They came forward with\n",
      "these, with no small spirit, but soon lost their courage because,\n",
      "before the machines were brought into position, they were destroyed by\n",
      "the artillery, which inflicted much damage upon the enemy. So, after\n",
      "some slight encounters, they abandoned the siege and fled into the\n",
      "country. Against them was despatched the sargento-mayor, Christobal de\n",
      "Azcueta, with as many Spanish soldiers, Indians, and Japanese as could\n",
      "be got together. As a result of the good order which he maintained,\n",
      "the Chinese were killed off little by little, until there was not left\n",
      "a man of them. This was accomplished without any harm to our troops,\n",
      "for, no matter how much the Chinese strove to force them to give a\n",
      "general battle, they constantly refused it; but they kept the Chinese\n",
      "in sight while they were marching, and halted whenever they halted,\n",
      "surrounding themselves with a palisade of stakes which they carried\n",
      "for the purpose. These they arranged not in one line, but in two,\n",
      "so that in case of attack--and many attacks were made--before the\n",
      "Chinese could reach the palisades and pass them, the Spaniards with\n",
      "their arquebuses and arrows killed the greater number of them. The\n",
      "loss of life was especially great among the most courageous, who\n",
      "led the van; while the rest turned back in terror, without effecting\n",
      "anything. Hunger also fought with them powerfully, because, as our\n",
      "soldiers kept them constantly under surveillance, they could not go\n",
      "aside to forage. The little food which they had brought from Manila\n",
      "was quickly exhausted; and, after that was gone, their lives followed\n",
      "rapidly. Thus by the twentieth of October the war was at an end and\n",
      "everything was quiet. But the city was greatly in need of all sorts\n",
      "of things, for all the trades were in the hands of the Chinese,\n",
      "and, now that they were dead, there was no shoemaker, or tailor,\n",
      "or dealer in provisions, or any other necessary tradesman; and there\n",
      "was no hope that they would come again to this country for trade and\n",
      "commerce. On this account it was determined to send an embassy to\n",
      "China, to give information as to the facts of the case. There were\n",
      "appointed as ambassadors Captain Marcos de la Cueba and father Fray\n",
      "Luis Gandullo, one of our religious--a man of great virtue, sanctity,\n",
      "and prudence, who had gone to China on two other occasions. They\n",
      "suffered much hardship on the voyage, but finally succeeded in\n",
      "their negotiations with the viceroy of the province of Chincheo,\n",
      "which is the place from which the Chinese come to Manila. After he\n",
      "had given them license to get a supply of ammunition for the city,\n",
      "he dismissed them, promising to continue the trade. This promise was\n",
      "carried into effect, for in the following year there came thirteen\n",
      "ships; and from that day forward everything has gone on as if nothing\n",

      "Miguel de San Jacintho, a religious of much prudence, great virtue,\n",

      "his associates as their superior on the journey from Espana, that\n",
      "position having been vacated by the death in Mexico of father Fray\n",

      "of all that they regarded themselves as fortunate in having found\n",
      "a superior who looked out so carefully for the advantage of every\n",
      "one without ever forgetting the general good of the order--which, as\n",
      "being more universal, takes precedence and commands higher esteem. In\n",
      "the affairs of the voyage, which are many and full of difficulty,\n",
      "he conducted himself so well and anticipated them with such accuracy\n",
      "that it seemed as if all of his life had been spent in the office of\n",
      "conducting religious. This is a function that calls for many diverse\n",
      "qualities, difficult to find united in a single person unless he is a\n",
      "man of so superior a nature as was father Fray Miguel. When he arrived\n",
      "in the province, they sent him to the district of Nueva Segovia. Here\n",
      "he was one of the first missionaries and founders of this conversion;\n",
      "and was one of the best and most careful, most beloved by the Indians,\n",
      "and most devoted to his duties as a religious, who had ever been in\n",
      "that province. He suffered all the hardships and necessities, the\n",

      "them, although he was a man of strong constitution and fitted to endure\n",
      "much, the want and the lack of food resulted in causing severe pains\n",
      "of the stomach. This evidently resulted from hunger, for as soon\n",
      "as he had a moderate amount of food he was well; but this happened\n",
      "seldom, and most of the time they had nothing to eat but some wild\n",
      "herbs which they gathered in the fields, and which were more suited\n",
      "to purge their stomachs than to sustain their lives. Hence in jest\n",
      "father Fray Gaspar Zarfate, who was his associate, said to him that\n",
      "he was greatly in doubt whether they were properly keeping the fasts\n",
      "prescribed by the constitutions, because they ate the same thing for\n",
      "supper in the evening as for dinner at noon; for, as they had nothing\n",
      "else, they ate quilites at noon for dinner, and quilites at night for\n",
      "supper. There were received at this chapter the church and house of\n",

      "religious, the new provincial was encouraged to take the charge of so\n",
      "many new churches and villages which were so much in need of teaching,\n",
      "for they had never had any, and were nearly all heathen. The good\n",
      "bishop did not fail of his promise. He had been one of the first and\n",
      "most prominent founders of this province, had seen and passed through\n",
      "the great sufferings which the establishment of it required, and had\n",
      "likewise had his share in the great harvest which the religious had\n",
      "reaped in these regions. He therefore loved it much, and strove with\n",
      "all his might to increase it; and hence, when he was about to come\n",
      "to his bishopric, he endeavored to bring with him a goodly number\n",
      "of excellent religious. The vicar in charge of them was father Fray\n",
      "Bernabe de Reliegos, a son of the distinguished convent of San Pablo\n",
      "at Valladolid, where in the course of time he went after some years\n",
      "to die, leaving the religious highly edified by his happy death,\n",
      "which was to be expected from his very devoted life. The example\n",
      "which they gave on the way from their convents to Sevilla was such\n",
      "that it highly edified the people of the towns through which they\n",
      "passed. The religious who set out from San Pablo at Valladolid\n",
      "were four in number, and they made their way to the port on foot,\n",
      "asking alms and sustaining themselves solely by what the Lord gave to\n",
      "them as to His poor. Although on some occasions they suffered from\n",
      "need because there was no one to give them sufficient alms, they\n",
      "never made use of the money which the superior had sent them for the\n",
      "journey--esteeming more highly that which was given them for the love\n",
      "of God, and putting aside the shame which begging alms at the doors\n",
      "brings with it. They came to a small hamlet in the Sierra Morena, and,\n",
      "though they went two by two to search for lodgings, they found none,\n",
      "and still less did they find any food. Hence in their need, which was\n",
      "great because they had gone on foot, they went to find the alcalde,\n",
      "to lay their necessities before him. After he had several times\n",
      "refused to see them, he at last admitted them at night, and sent\n",
      "them to a house with orders that they should receive the friars. A\n",
      "gentleman from Baeca was there, who, seeing that they were poor, had\n",
      "compassion upon them and sent a page to invite them to eat dinner,\n",
      "although he had already dined before the religious could reach the\n",
      "house. They thanked him for these alms, but declined them, saying that\n",
      "the alcalde of the town had provided for their dinner and lodging;\n",
      "and the gentleman sent them forty reals in charity, saying that he\n",
      "did not send them more because he was journeying on business to the\n",
      "court, where the expenses were so great that they left him no more\n",
      "with which he could help the friars, as he wished to do. That the Lord\n",
      "permits such needs is not due to His lack of power or of love, and He\n",
      "ordinarily makes up for them with similar or greater recompenses. In\n",
      "Baylen they went around the town two by two, and when they had all\n",
      "come together, without obtaining more than two or three cuartos in\n",
      "alms, night came upon them without any inn or lodging. A man was\n",
      "following their path who had noticed what happened to them, and he\n",
      "offered them his house. They thanked him, and accepted his charity;\n",
      "but the house was nothing but a poor peddler's shed, three brazas long\n",
      "and two wide, and, that he might take them in, he sent his wife that\n",
      "night to sleep elsewhere. But a house of charity could not fail to\n",
      "be large and spacious, and hence the religious rested in it with much\n",
      "satisfaction and joy. In the morning the Lord paid the charitable host\n",
      "for the lodging; for the conde, learning of what had happened, called\n",
      "him to appear in presence of the religious, thanked him for what he\n",
      "had done, and, promising him his favor for the future, forced a man who\n",
      "had done our host some wrong, some days before, to recompense him for\n",
      "it immediately. Thus he went away happier than if it had been a feast\n",
      "day, though this is not the principal pay for such works, for they\n",
      "earn glory in the sight of God. All the religious reached Sevilla,\n",
      "and set sail on St. John's day in a small vessel to go to Cadiz and\n",
      "take ship. At noon they were at a considerable distance from land,\n",
      "and the master of the ship was very inattentive. The religious saw\n",
      "three vessels with lateen sails following them, and were amused at\n",
      "these because they had never seen that kind of sail before. This\n",
      "called the attention of the master, and he went up and looked at\n",
      "them. Seeing that they were Moorish vessels, he trimmed his sails,\n",
      "and turning the helm, set out to run ashore. When he succeeded, he\n",
      "said: \"Some saint is sailing in this boat, on whose account our Lord\n",
      "has delivered us today from falling into the hands of Moors; for it\n",
      "is they who were chasing us with their light sails and swift boats,\n",
      "from which it was impossible that this heavy bark with its heavy load\n",
      "should have escaped, if some superior power had not been watching over\n",
      "us by some saint who has been traveling with your Reverences.\" On the\n",
      "following day it was learned that at that very same place some people\n",
      "who had taken the same voyage had been captured, wherefore they saw\n",
      "themselves obliged anew to render most humble thanks to the Lord\n",
      "for His singular mercy and kindness. They went on board the ships;\n",
      "and when the fleet was sailing in the gulf which on account of its\n",
      "restlessness and the many waves which are always there, is called\n",
      "Golfo de las Yeguas [i.e., \"Gulf of the Mares\"], two sailors fell\n",
      "overboard from the flagship--an accident which often happens when they\n",
      "are working in confusion at a critical moment. The flagship--not being\n",
      "able to help them, since it was carried on and separated from them by\n",
      "the wind--gave a signal, by discharging a piece, to the ships that\n",
      "followed it that they should try to pick up the men. As none of the\n",
      "other ships was able to go to their help, that one on which were the\n",
      "bishop and the religious hove to; but, on account of the excitement of\n",
      "the moment, they failed to do so with proper caution and prudence. The\n",
      "rudder was brought over with all the sails up so that the head of the\n",
      "ship was brought down dangerously, and the whole bow as far back as the\n",
      "foremast went under water. That there might not be one accident only,\n",
      "the violence of the wind and the burden of the sails and the force of\n",
      "the waves jerked the tiller [pincote] from those who were at the helm,\n",
      "and swung it across fast under the biscuit hatchway, leaving the ship\n",
      "without means to steer it when that was most needed. The hatchway was\n",
      "closed, and no key was to be found. The ship was going to the bottom,\n",
      "being submerged in the water, and the waves, which were like mountains,\n",
      "were beating on its sides, so that the mariners in alarm were shouting,\n",
      "\"We are lost, we are going to the bottom and cannot help ourselves,\n",
      "for want of a rudder and direction.\" \"Let us turn,\" said the bishop,\n",
      "\"to our Mother and Lady, the mother of God, and let us promise to\n",
      "fast in her honor for three days on bread and water if by her help\n",
      "we may receive our lives.\" The religious did so, and, falling down\n",
      "in prayer, they supplicated her for aid; and instantly--a proper work\n",
      "for the divine pity and that of the Mother of Compassion--the tiller,\n",
      "or stem of the rudder, came out, of itself, from the hole into which it\n",
      "had gone. This was contrary to the common expectation in the ordinary\n",
      "course of similar cases; for the hole was very small, and therefore\n",
      "it was very difficult for anything which had once entered it to be\n",
      "brought back again. Four men quickly caught it, and, bringing it\n",
      "across with great strength, turned the ship back into its course. The\n",
      "seamen were in amazement at this extraordinary event; and, as they\n",
      "had had experience in like cases, they regarded it as the favor and\n",
      "benefit of our Lady who had been invoked by her afflicted and unhappy\n",
      "chaplains. Therefore to her the religions rendered devout and humble\n",
      "thanks, and with great joy fulfilled the vow which they had made.\n",
      "\n",
      "On its voyage the fleet touched at the island of Guadalupe for wood\n",
      "and water. This island was inhabited by a barbarous and inhuman race,\n",
      "bare of any sort of clothing, and (what is worse) bare of any sort\n",
      "of pity; for they had no pity upon those who, without doing them any\n",
      "harm, came there to get water which would be wasted in the sea, and\n",
      "wood for which they had no use whatsoever. There were in the fleet\n",
      "the Marques de Montes Claros, going to be viceroy of Nueva Espana,\n",
      "and, as commander, Don Fulgencio de Meneses y Toledo; and on the eve\n",
      "of our father St. Dominic, twenty-five soldiers having gone ashore as\n",
      "a guard with an ensign in command, all those on board the fleet went\n",
      "ashore and mass was said as the religious had desired. After that,\n",
      "the religious and all the rest went to wash their clothes and to\n",
      "bathe themselves, of which there was great need. The sailors went to\n",
      "get wood and water. Being all more widely scattered than was proper,\n",
      "they failed to keep a proper lookout, when they ought to have been more\n",
      "on their guard against the peril which menaced them. The islanders,\n",
      "taking advantage of the opportunity to carry out their evil purpose,\n",
      "came down close to them, being hidden in the thick undergrowth of\n",
      "the mountain. They began to shoot arrows at the Spaniards when the\n",
      "Spaniards were not keeping a lookout, and when they themselves had\n",
      "the advantage. This they did so rapidly and in such numbers that it\n",
      "seemed as if it rained arrows. When the Indians were perceived many\n",
      "were already wounded, and much blood had been shed. The surprise\n",
      "and confusion threw the crew into a panic, and huddling together in\n",
      "a frightened group they fled, each man striving to put himself in\n",
      "safety--one leaping into the boat to go back to the ship; another\n",
      "throwing himself into the sea, which was then regarded as more\n",
      "pitiful than the land; still another hiding himself among the trees\n",
      "and letting the savages pass as they shot their arrows at those\n",
      "whom they found ahead of them, and letting them pick up as spoils\n",
      "the clothes which he had been washing, or which were now being dried\n",
      "after the washing. Those who could do least to resist the attack of\n",
      "the islanders were the religious; and hence many of them fell wounded\n",
      "and others dead, for it was easier to draw their souls from them than\n",
      "to draw out the arrows. Three of them hid themselves in a thicket,\n",
      "where the Lord delivered them from a shower of arrows which were shot\n",
      "after them as they went to hide. Holding a little [image of] Christ\n",
      "in their hands, they begged him earnestly that he would blind the\n",
      "savages that they might not see them and might pass them by. The Lord\n",
      "heard them, and thus, though the islanders saw them hide themselves\n",
      "and shot many arrows after them, yet the arrows did not strike them;\n",
      "and the Indians, who are keener than mastiffs in discovering people,\n",
      "could not find them, though they passed the place where they were.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wounded were: father Fray Juan Luis de Guete, a son of the convent\n",
      "of Preachers in Valencia, in whose spine an arrow was fastened, being\n",
      "stopped by the bone; father Fray Juan Naya, a son of the convent of San\n",
      "Pedro Martyr at Calatayud, who escaped with a wound in his arm where\n",
      "an arrow had passed through it; and father Fray Jacintho Calvo, who\n",
      "was struck twice. He was a son of the convent of La Pena de Francia,\n",
      "where in course of time he hung up one of the arrows. The wounds were\n",
      "not so penetrating as to take their lives; but they made the fathers\n",
      "very happy because here, with this blessed beginning, they had begun\n",
      "to shed their blood for the Lord who had redeemed them with His own,\n",
      "and for the gospel which they were going to preach in His service. The\n",
      "religious who died there were six. They were so picked and selected\n",
      "among all the rest that, as they were the cream of all the others,\n",
      "it was plain that that which the islanders had done en masse was,\n",
      "so far as concerned the Lord, a most particular providence of His\n",
      "who had directed the arrows against the best and the ripest of the\n",
      "religious that they might be offered as early fruit on the table of\n",
      "the supreme Father, as something in which one may safely assert that\n",
      "He takes much pleasure. Three of these holy martyrs were children\n",
      "of the most religious convent of Preachers in Valencia, which,\n",
      "as it is so prolific in saints, naturally had here the greater\n",
      "share. The first was father Fray Juan de Moratalla, a native of\n",
      "Murcia, a religious of noble example, great mortification, silence,\n",
      "modesty, and composure. [He was devoted to prayer and solitude,\n",
      "and to the good of others. The second was father Fray Vicente Palao\n",
      "Valenciano, a religious very precise in his observance of the rules,\n",
      "and such as a priest ought to be. The third was Fray Juan Martinez,\n",
      "a priest, an Aragonese, a religious of purest and holiest life. The\n",
      "fourth was Fray Juan Cano, a native of Burgo de Osma, a son of San\n",
      "Pablo de Valladolid, young in age, old in virtue. The fifth religious\n",
      "was Fray Pedro Moreno, a deacon, a native of Villalba, a son of the\n",
      "royal convent of Sancta Cruz at Segovia, and a member of the most\n",
      "illustrious college of San Gregorio at Valladolid. He was devoted\n",
      "to prayer and to silent meditation. At his death the Lord wrought a\n",
      "miracle by enabling him to make his way to the seashore, where he died\n",
      "in prayer, and was afterward found beneath the water in the attitude\n",
      "of prayer. The sixth religious was Fray Jacintho de Cistenes, a son\n",
      "of the convent at Valencia, and a native of that noble city. He was\n",
      "young in age but venerable for his virtue. The Lord had revealed to\n",
      "him that he should die on the day of St. Lawrence, as he actually did,\n",
      "after suffering for some time from his mortal wound. [39]]\n",

      "The erection of some churches, which took place at this time\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The religious who were coming to the province, although they had\n",
      "been diminished in number by the savages of Guadalupe, were of great\n",
      "use. They were fourteen in number, and, that they might immediately\n",
      "begin that which they had sought over so many seas and through so\n",
      "many hardships, they were assigned to their duties. The newly-elected\n",
      "provincial took with him four for the province of Nueva Segovia,\n",
      "where at that time the conversions were going on rapidly, because the\n",
      "country was large and nearly all the inhabitants were heathen. When\n",
      "they reached the cape known as Cabo del Bojeador, a place which is\n",
      "ordinarily a difficult one, the provincial saw that a small cloud which\n",
      "covered the peaks of some mountains near there was moving toward the\n",
      "sea, which began to be unquiet and rough. The pilot thought it best\n",
      "that the sails should be lowered somewhat, in order better to resist\n",
      "the attack of the wind and the waves which threatened them. While he\n",
      "was striving to do this, the tempest anticipated him; and the wind came\n",
      "with such force that wind and wave turned the vessel on its side, and\n",
      "the water entered over the sides of the ship. It was necessary for the\n",
      "religious to put their hands to the oars, while the rest went to work,\n",
      "with great difficulty, to get in the sails--nothing being left but the\n",
      "courses, in order to make it possible to steer. Although the amount of\n",
      "sail was so small, the wind was so powerful that, lifting the vessel on\n",
      "one side, it forced the other under the water. The religious repeated\n",
      "the exorcisms against the tempest, upon which it subsided a little;\n",
      "but when the exorcism was completed it came back with as much force as\n",
      "at first, almost capsizing the vessel, and making it ship water. When\n",
      "the exorcism was renewed, the tempest moderated itself anew; but when\n",
      "the exorcism was completed, its fury returned as before. Thus they\n",
      "perceived that this tempest was not merely a tempest of wind and of\n",
      "waves, but was aided by the devil--who at the words of the exorcism\n",
      "lost his strength, and as soon as that ceased received it again,\n",
      "to hinder the ministers of the gospel. Four times they repeated the\n",
      "exorcism, and four times the same thing happened, upon which the\n",
      "father provincial, recognizing the author of this evil, said: \"Since\n",
      "I see that ministers are to be given to the villages of the heathen,\n",
      "and that the devil, who unjustly keeps them under his tyranny, is\n",
      "about to be banished from them, I promise to build a church under\n",
      "the patronage of the guardian angels, that they may aid us against\n",
      "this cursed enemy who is so clearly making war against us.\" As soon\n",
      "as he had made this promise, it seemed that the guardian angels took\n",
      "upon themselves the protection of the fragata; for the tornado began\n",
      "to disappear, and they continued their voyage. On the following day\n",
      "they rounded the cape, by rowing against a slight contrary wind which\n",
      "had arisen; and when this wind had quieted down, the fragata came to\n",
      "some billows where a number of opposing currents met. The waves were\n",
      "so high that the little boat put its side under water. A religious\n",
      "threw into the sea some relics of St. Raymond, repeating the glories\n",
      "of the saint, and the sea was immediately calmed--just as when water\n",
      "boils too violently in the kettle, and a little water is poured into\n",
      "it; and by the kindness of the saint a fair wind was given to them,\n",
      "with which they continued their voyage.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they reached Nueva Segovia, a minister was provided for the\n",
      "village of Nasiping, which had been accepted ten years before, but\n",
      "for which it had been impossible previously to provide a minister\n",
      "because the supply of them was so scanty. Even now there was so much\n",
      "requiring the attention of the religious, and they were so few, that\n",
      "half a miracle was necessary for the missionary to be given. Father\n",
      "Fray Francisco de la Cruz, or Jurado, [40] was taken dangerously\n",
      "ill. He was a religious of much virtue, of whom they had great\n",
      "hopes. The father provincial, fearing to lose him, promised to give a\n",
      "minister to Nasiping if the sick man recovered. Father Fray Francisco\n",
      "recovered, and the provincial fulfilled his vow and named the church\n",
      "after St. Michael. This village is on the banks of the great river\n",
      "[i.e., of Cagayan], five or six leguas higher up than the city of\n",
      "the Spaniards. In the year 1625, twenty-one years after it received\n",
      "ministers, there had been baptized in it more than three thousand\n",
      "four hundred persons, as is certified by the baptismal records; and,\n",
      "in addition to this, many were baptized in sickness who, because\n",
      "of their immediate death, were not entered on the records. To this\n",
      "village there came an Indian from Tuguegarao, which is distant two\n",
      "days' journey by water. He very earnestly desired the religious to\n",
      "confess him, and to give him the other holy sacraments. The religious\n",
      "confessed him and gave him the communion, more that he might assist\n",
      "his devotion than because he supposed he was in danger. He had come\n",
      "on foot and seemed strong, so that it seemed that he was very far\n",
      "from being in such a state of necessity; but after he had received the\n",
      "sacrament he died. This was something at which the religious wondered,\n",
      "and which aroused in him great devotion and joy when with his eyes he\n",
      "saw so plainly the power of divine predestination, carried out in ways\n",
      "so hidden and mysterious. Father Fray Pedro Muriel, [41] who is still\n",
      "living, has testified as an eye-witness that when he was minister in\n",
      "that village, in the year 1631, the locusts were more in number than\n",
      "the natives had ever seen before. In the fields of that village they\n",
      "were in such numbers that they spread over a space three leguas in\n",
      "length and a quarter of a legua in breadth, covering the earth and the\n",
      "trees so that the ground could not be seen, so thickly did they cover\n",
      "it; and they ravaged the fields as if they had been burnt. [The Indians\n",
      "did what they could to frighten away the locusts, but in vain; and the\n",
      "Lord heard the prayers of one of the Indians that He would drive away\n",
      "the locusts during the night. At dawn, when he expected to find all of\n",
      "his fields desolated, he found that just half of them had been eaten,\n",
      "and that all the rest had been left. The Lord showed a similar grace to\n",
      "a poor woman who prayed for His aid in protecting her field of maize.]\n",
      "\n",
      "In this same year, 1604, the provincial sent three religious to the\n",
      "estuary of Lobo and the country of Ytabes, [42] in the province of\n",
      "Nueva Segovia. All those Indians are heathen; and though by nature they\n",
      "are very tractable and easy to deal with, simple and free from malice,\n",
      "and concerned with nothing but their agriculture, still the outrages\n",
      "of those who took tribute from them were so great that they enraged\n",
      "the natives and obliged them to take up arms, to the great loss of the\n",
      "Spaniards. As they were few and the multitude of the Indians many,\n",
      "the few, although they were very courageous, came to their death by\n",
      "the hands of the many; or, rather, the unjust came to death by the\n",
      "hands of divine justice, which in this way was pleased to chastise\n",
      "and end their injustices. And as we very seldom reckon rightly,\n",
      "the chastisement which God wrought by the hands of these Indians was\n",
      "attributed by the Spaniards to the courage and valor of this tribe;\n",
      "and thus they were very fearful of them until the holy gospel declared\n",
      "by the Dominican religious changed them from bloodthirsty wolves to\n",
      "gentle sheep--the Lord aiding by manifest miracles to give credit to\n",
      "His faith and to His ministers, to the end that they might be able\n",
      "to do that which without this or similar assistance from the Lord it\n",
      "would have been impossible to achieve. One of the three religious who\n",
      "entered these heathen villages to undertake their conversion said,\n",
      "in giving an account of what happened: \"Since the hand of the Lord\n",
      "has been so plainly succoring these Indians by the hands of those\n",
      "religious who dwelt among them, their reformation has been great and\n",
      "marvelous. They have gone from one extreme to the other, almost without\n",
      "any intermediate stage, since the religious took them under their\n",
      "care. Before that they were so free, so completely without God or law,\n",
      "without king or any person to respect, that they gave themselves up\n",
      "freely to their desires and their passions. Evidence of this is found\n",
      "in those wars which they were continually waging among themselves,\n",
      "without plan or order; and in the drunkenness and the outrages of\n",
      "which they were guilty, without regard to God or man. He who was most\n",
      "esteemed among them was the greatest drunkard, because, as he was the\n",
      "richest, he could obtain the most liquor. He who slew the greatest\n",
      "number of men was regarded as superior to all the rest. They married\n",
      "and unmarried daily, with one or many wives. In a word, they were a\n",
      "barbarous race, given up to all sorts of shameless conduct. In spite\n",
      "of all this, when the missionary came among them they were as docile\n",
      "as if they had during all their lives been learning to obey, which\n",
      "is something very difficult even in religious orders. This was true,\n",
      "although the religious instantly laid a general interdict upon all\n",
      "their ancient vices; obliged them to consort solely with their lawful\n",
      "wives; even forced many to abandon their land and their old villages,\n",
      "that they might come where teaching was given them; and, in a word,\n",
      "compelled them to enter all at once, and in a body, into ordered ways\n",
      "of living, in matters both divine and human. They had not a thought of\n",
      "opposing a single command; and this has been achieved without stripes\n",
      "or penalties, but simply by kindness and gentleness. The result has\n",
      "been that those who did not understand anything except killing, and\n",
      "drinking till they could not stand, and running without any restraint\n",
      "after every sort of vice, now never think of doing these things--as I\n",
      "have seen in these first three villages in this district of Ytabes. The\n",
      "day we went among them we found all the men lying about the streets,\n",
      "dead drunk; since that day there has not been one drunk enough to\n",
      "lose his senses. The same reformation has been achieved in all other\n",
      "matters, for they were not compelled to do all this by fear of the\n",
      "Spaniards. Quite otherwise; the Spaniards regarded these Indians as\n",
      "so indomitable and intrepid that, for fear of them, they did not dare\n",
      "go up the river as far as their villages; but after the religious went\n",
      "among them, they were gathered into large villages that they might be\n",
      "more easily instructed in the faith, having been previously scattered\n",
      "among many small ones, like so many farmsteads [in Spain]. There\n",
      "were three villages thus formed: one of about five hundred tributes,\n",
      "named Taban, the church of which was called San Raymundo; and the\n",
      "other two of more than a thousand tributes each--one called Pia, its\n",
      "church Santa Ynes de Monte Policiano, afterwards known as San Domingo;\n",
      "and the last one, named Tuao, the church of which was dedicated to the\n",
      "holy guardian angels because of the incident referred to above. Thus\n",
      "all those people were brought together and united, to reduce them\n",
      "to settlements, and to a civilized mode of life and government; and\n",
      "to the church; but this result was obtained at no small cost to the\n",
      "religious. Of three of them, two immediately fell very sick, and the\n",
      "third still more so, for he died as a result of the illness. This was\n",
      "father Fray Luis de Yllescas, a son of the convent of Sancto Domingo at\n",
      "Mexico, a very humble religious, very obedient and beloved by all. He\n",
      "received the holy sacraments for his departure with great devotion;\n",
      "and went away to enjoy, as may be presumed, the reward of his labors,\n",
      "which had been many in a short time. Yet neither this death nor the\n",
      "failure of health in the rest caused them to withdraw their hands\n",
      "from the work upon which they had begun. On the contrary, the great\n",
      "good which they beheld, wrought by the Lord among these Indians,\n",
      "served as medicines and remedies for the ills from which they suffered;\n",
      "and for their convalescence, though they had no worldly luxuries,\n",
      "that fruit was much better which, more and more every day, was borne by\n",
      "this new plant of the church. From it they recovered health, strength,\n",
      "and new courage to carry on the work which they had begun. To give\n",
      "them still greater spirit, the Lord came to them working miracles. The\n",
      "first mass which was celebrated in the village of Pia took place on\n",
      "St. Bartholomew's day, the twenty-fourth of August. [Before the end\n",
      "of the month, a sick person who wished to be baptised beheld some\n",
      "fierce and abominable forms which dissuaded him from baptism, and\n",
      "reminded him of the rights and customs of his ancestors, charging\n",
      "him not to change the faith in which his fathers and grandfathers\n",
      "had lived. These dreadful forms were driven away by three persons,\n",
      "clad in black cloaks with white garments beneath. The sick man was\n",
      "often asked if he knew these three persons who had delivered him, and\n",
      "he said \"no.\" When he was asked if they were religious of our order\n",
      "he also said \"no,\" because he had never seen any of the religious\n",
      "wearing their cloaks. He always declared that he had been awake and\n",
      "not asleep; and the narrative was accepted as certain. At one time,\n",
      "a religious who was himself in poor health was left in charge of\n",
      "thirteen newly-converted Christians, who were all confined to their\n",
      "beds by sickness. Being unable to give them the care which he desired,\n",
      "he placed upon the abdomen of each of them a little roasted rice-bran,\n",
      "very hot, begging the Lord to make up by His pity for the lack of\n",
      "medicine. When he came back the next day to visit them, all but two\n",
      "were well, and had gone to work in the field; and the others soon\n",
      "recovered. The same treatment given by another Indian or by the sick\n",
      "man to himself had no effect; and thus it is plain that the healing was\n",
      "due to the desire of the Lord to honor and to give authority to the\n",
      "hand which applied the remedy. The Indians themselves observed that,\n",
      "after they had religious, far fewer died than before they had them. In\n",
      "their ancient days of superstition, when a man fell sick he generally\n",
      "died, because he was treated only by the witchcraft of the aniteras,\n",
      "whose sole purpose was to get gold from the sick persons by false\n",
      "promises. The sorcerers did them no good and indeed rather harmed them,\n",
      "since cures came from our worst enemy, the devil; while now the Lord\n",
      "was giving them, by means of the religious, health that was health\n",
      "indeed. One of the religious in this region, father Fray Juan Naya,\n",
      "[43] fell ill, and grew worse so rapidly that he was given up as a\n",
      "consumptive. By the advice of another religious, he made a vow to\n",
      "our Lady to serve in that province among the heathen, if she should\n",
      "be pleased to grant him sufficient health for him to carry on this\n",
      "work. He made the vow for seven consecutive years from the day of the\n",
      "Visitation, July 2, 1605. During all this time he had his health;\n",
      "but at the end of the seven years he was attacked by a very severe\n",
      "and dangerous illness, which left him when he renewed his vow for\n",
      "four years more. Similar experiences have been frequent among the\n",
      "religious. It has even happened to some who were not very devoted\n",
      "to this work, and who desired to go to other provinces where the\n",
      "Lord might be served with less severity and with somewhat greater\n",
      "comfort, that they have been afflicted with diseases, which gave\n",
      "place to miraculous health as soon as they made vows to remain and\n",
      "minister to the Indians whom they wished to leave. In this region the\n",
      "Lord manifested His goodness and gave authority to his ministers,\n",
      "curing a sick woman who was at the point of death, by means of the\n",
      "sacrament of holy baptism. In this same village it happened to father\n",
      "Fray Juan Naya that a poisonous snake entered his shoe without any evil\n",
      "effect. An Indian in this same village called upon God in his illness,\n",
      "and, when it did not seem good to the divine Providence to heal him,\n",
      "he called upon the devil whom he had previously served. The Lord\n",
      "punished him with dreadful visions, from which he was delivered upon\n",
      "praying to the Lord for His protection; and he was finally cured,\n",
      "after making his confession. A child was miraculously healed in\n",
      "the town of Pia at the time when father Fray Juan Sancta Ana was\n",
      "vicar there. A woman who did not seem to be dangerously ill prayed\n",
      "so earnestly to be baptized that the father granted her wish. She\n",
      "died almost immediately after, the Lord having shown her a marvelous\n",
      "kindness in causing the religious to baptize her immediately.]\n",

      "\n",
      "[In the church of the village of Pia there was an image of our Lady\n",
      "on one of the side altars. It had been made in Macan, and had been\n",
      "first set up in the church of our order in the city of Nueva Segovia,\n",
      "whence it was taken to the church of Pia. Here the image was greatly\n",
      "beloved; and when father Fray Juan de Sancta Ana gave it away to\n",
      "another village, after having received a second image of much greater\n",
      "beauty, the people begged so earnestly to have it returned that the\n",
      "vicar was obliged to have another painted on canvas and sent to the\n",
      "village of Tuguegarao (to which he had given the one for which the\n",
      "Indians begged), and to have the first image brought back. While the\n",
      "father was considering where it would best be put, the idea occurred\n",
      "to him that it would be well to establish a shrine on the road between\n",
      "Pia and Tuao, at a distance of about a league and a half from each of\n",
      "the towns. This shrine was set up on St. Stephen's day in 1623. On\n",
      "the day on which the shrine was consecrated more than ten thousand\n",
      "persons were gathered together from the neighboring villages. One of\n",
      "the women of the highest rank in the village of Pia undertook the\n",
      "care of the shrine, placing a lamp to burn constantly before the\n",
      "holy image. This Indian was named Dona Ynes Maguilabun. The Virgin\n",
      "was not slow to reward her for this devotion, for once when Dona Ynes\n",
      "took with her to the shrine her little nephew, a child of five years,\n",
      "who was suffering from a large swelling under his left arm--a disease\n",
      "among the Indians which runs into an abscess, and, being so near the\n",
      "heart, is very dangerous indeed, because of the lack of medicines and\n",
      "of medical science among these Indians--the little one was left in\n",
      "the shrine, and fell asleep on the steps of the altar. While there\n",
      "he had a vision of the Virgin, and, when he awoke, the swelling was\n",
      "entirely healed. Other miracles were wrought by the same image. One\n",
      "particularly worthy of mention happened in the year 1624. There being\n",
      "a severe drouth, the father who was at that time in the village of\n",
      "Tuao, Fray Andres de Haro, [44] and father Fray Juan de Sancta Ana,\n",
      "decided to make some processions and offer prayers to the Lord for His\n",

      "from each of the villages to the shrine. The Indians of Pia confessed\n",
      "their sins, that the burden of them might be removed from the land;\n",
      "and on that same Sunday it rained so copiously in the region of this\n",
      "village of Pia that it seemed as if the village would be drowned and\n",
      "as if the floodgates of heaven were open. On the day appointed for\n",
      "the processions, the father of the village of Pia told the Indians\n",
      "that it was not necessary to make the procession, but that he would\n",
      "say a solemn mass of thanks to our Lady, which could be done in the\n",
      "church. They, however, insisted; and when they reached the shrine\n",
      "they found there all the people of the village of Tuao, where not\n",
      "a drop of rain had fallen, because the inhabitants of Tuao had not\n",
      "thought of confessing. They immediately began to prepare themselves for\n",
      "confession, and all that day the inhabitants of Tuao and Pia confessed\n",
      "their sins, revealing some which, from lack of faith, or pusillanimity,\n",
      "or shame, they had concealed. When they reached home in the evening it\n",
      "began to rain in both villages and in all the fields around them; and\n",
      "it rained so hard that it was impossible to bring back the ornaments\n",

      "Among the great kindnesses and benefits which our province, and indeed\n",

      "suffered great tribulations, and found themselves suddenly besieged by\n",
      "a number of enemies much larger than their own--enemies from within\n",
      "their houses and their homes--they found in him a true father for\n",
      "their consolation, and a prelate acceptable to God, who could placate\n",
      "His ire by interceding for his people. He was born in Carrion de Los\n",
      "Condes, of noble parents, well known in that region because of their\n",
      "descent and their virtue. When he was not more than fifteen years old\n",
      "he assumed the habit of this religious order, and learned by experience\n",
      "how true is the saying of the Holy Spirit that it is well for a man to\n",
      "carry the easy yoke of the service of God from his youth. He received\n",
      "the habit and professed in the distinguished convent of San Pablo at\n",
      "Valladolid. He immediately began to display the subtilty of his mind,\n",
      "which was very great; at the very beginning of his studies he seemed\n",
      "like an eagle soaring above his fellow-pupils, distinguishing himself\n",
      "by special marks or acuteness, so that most of the students and the\n",
      "learned were astonished. He was, accordingly, soon made a member of the\n",
      "college of San Gregorio in that city, a crucible in which is refined\n",
      "the metal of the finest intellects which the order has in the provinces\n",
      "of Espana and Andalucia. Here he had as master him who of right was\n",
      "the master of the theology of Espana--the most learned father Fray\n",
      "Domingo Banez. The two were so completely suited to each other in\n",
      "virtue and ability that father Fray Miguel could not fail to be the\n",
      "beloved disciple of such a master. So much did the great teacher love\n",
      "him that, when he saw him advance so far in both virtue and ability,\n",
      "he was accustomed to say Hic est discipulus ille [i.e., \"This is that\n",
      "disciple\"], giving him by antonomasia the name of his disciple, out of\n",
      "the many, whom he regarded with so great praise. He taught the arts in\n",
      "his convent, and theology in many houses of the province; and finally\n",
      "returned to be lecturer in theology in his convent of San Pablo. It\n",
      "was while he was engaged in this duty and exercise that he was taken\n",
      "captive by the voice of father Fray Juan Chrisostomo, who was seeking\n",
      "for religious for the foundation of the province of the Holy Rosary\n",
      "in the Philippinas. The province was to be founded for the conversion\n",
      "of the many heathen who were in those islands, and for the purpose of\n",
      "entering upon the preaching of the gospel in the most populous kingdom\n",
      "of China, if the Lord should open the door to it, as well as in that\n",
      "of Japon and the other kingdoms neighboring to the said islands. Being\n",
      "seized by a fervent desire and a holy zeal for the redemption of the\n",
      "souls of the many heathen in these islands, he gave up his position\n",
      "as lecturer, and the honors and degrees which were waiting for him;\n",
      "and esteeming it a higher task to labor for Christ and for his fellow\n",
      "men he made up his mind to go with those who were preparing for this\n",
      "holy journey. The Lord thus ordained because of the serious problems\n",
      "which were to be met, in which his character, ability, knowledge,\n",
      "and talents would be very necessary to overcome the many obstacles\n",
      "which confronted this holy foundation as soon as its founders reached\n",
      "Nueva Espana, and also in the royal court and in the Roman court;\n",
      "for in all these places there were many impediments. Against all\n",
      "of them father Fray Miguel was the defender of truth; and by his\n",
      "speeches and writings he came off always victor. Afterward, when\n",
      "the difficulty which was met with in Mexico was overcome, he came,\n",
      "with the rest of the fathers who founded the province, to the city\n",
      "of Manila on the day of the apostle St. James; and on the day of our\n",
      "father St. Dominic, which came immediately afterward, he presided in\n",
      "the great church over some theological discussions. This he did to the\n",
      "admiration of his listeners, who were not accustomed to have anything\n",
      "so remarkable in these regions. The good bishop of these islands, Don\n",
      "Fray Domingo de Salacar, was bathed with tears of joy when he heard,\n",
      "to the great refreshing of his spirit, such superior preachers of the\n",
      "gospel in his bishopric--men who were not only fit to be teachers\n",
      "of these heathen races, but to teach others who might be the same,\n",
      "and this more excellently than he had ever expected to see in those\n",
      "regions. Among the many various heathen nations who come to this\n",
      "country that which excels in intelligence, civilization, and courtesy\n",
      "is that of the Chinese; and, much as they excel in these qualities,\n",
      "they likewise excel in their multitude and number. For there are very\n",
      "many who come every year to attend to their large and rich business,\n",
      "and to serve the city in all the trades which can be expected in the\n",
      "best regulated of cities; for they learn everything with the greatest\n",
      "ability, and succeed in everything that they undertake.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the Chinese, though very few, were Christians; and it was\n",
      "believed that many would be converted if there were someone to preach\n",
      "in their language. But this is so difficult that, although many\n",
      "desirous to undertake that conversion had endeavored to learn it, no\n",
      "one as yet had succeeded; and thus no religious order had taken up this\n",
      "ministry, being afraid of the difficulty of the language. When father\n",
      "Fray Miguel arrived, he instantly undertook this enterprise--for the\n",
      "Lord had created him for great things; and this ministry was given to\n",
      "our order, the bishop asking each and everyone of the religious orders\n",
      "who were there before to undertake it, and not one of them accepting it\n",
      "because of the reason given. Father Fray Miguel immediately began with\n",
      "all his energy to study this language, and succeeded with it. What\n",
      "is more, he learned many of the letters of it, which are much more\n",
      "difficult. Father Fray Juan Cobo joining him immediately, they began\n",
      "to teach the Chinese, amazing those people that anyone should have\n",
      "been able to succeed with their language and to preach to them in\n",
      "it. Much greater was their amazement, however, at the extraordinary\n",
      "virtue and charity which they beheld in these two religious. They did\n",
      "not content themselves with the labor of teaching them--which was\n",
      "not small, for soon many were converted and began to be baptized;\n",
      "but they proposed to build a hospital where the sick poor could be\n",
      "cared for. The number of these was great, because their sufferings\n",
      "were great in this foreign land, where they were neglected by all,\n",
      "and suffered the extremity of need, which is sickness and death. The\n",
      "fathers began their hospitals; and, poor religious as they were,\n",
      "they had no better house than that which they were able to make,\n",
      "almost without money, out of beams and old planks--the habits and\n",
      "cloaks of the religious often serving as beds, because they had no\n",
      "other bedclothes. The religious sometimes brought in the sick whom\n",
      "they found lying on the streets, without power to move themselves\n",
      "and with no one to pity them. In this way the fame of the virtue\n",
      "of father Fray Miguel and his companions was very widely spread,\n",
      "and there were many of the Chinese heathen who were converted and\n",
      "baptized. The fragrance of this great charity spread so far that it\n",
      "reached Great China and proclaimed in trumpet tones what was done\n",
      "for their sick in the Philippinas. There was one man who came from\n",
      "China to look upon so rare a thing as caring for the sick--poor, and\n",
      "cast out by their own nation and kinsmen; but admitted, sought for,\n",
      "and cared for by persons who were not known to them, and who were not\n",
      "only of another nation, but of a different law and faith, and who\n",
      "labored without any expectation of temporal profit, but merely for\n",
      "the salvation of souls. Hence the Lord was favorable to them, and\n",
      "this work was constantly growing better in all things. It is today\n",
      "one of the most glorious things in Christendom, not because of its\n",
      "income and its building (though in these respects it is very good),\n",
      "but because of the many who at the hour of death are baptized in it\n",
      "with many indications of going hence to glory, as being newly cleansed\n",
      "of their faults and their sins by baptism.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rich harvest which was reaped in the conversion of these Chinese,\n",
      "as well by preaching to those in health as by the care and instruction\n",
      "of the sick, was so sweet to father Fray Miguel that it caused in\n",
      "him glowing desires to go to Great China. It seemed to him, and with\n",
      "reason, that there, without abandoning their own country and the\n",
      "company of their fathers, sons, wives, and kinsmen, which here are\n",
      "great impediments to their conversion, the Christians converted would\n",
      "be many more, and far better ones. Hence he was always making plans to\n",
      "go to that great realm, where the devil is so strongly fortified that\n",
      "he does not even permit the entrance of those who might, by preaching\n",
      "the gospel, cast him from the throne which he unjustly holds among\n",
      "that people. He was finally successful in making his entry into that\n",
      "kingdom, and went there with father Fray Juan de Castro, who was\n",
      "the first provincial of this province. They suffered the hardships\n",
      "which have been described in chapter twenty-six, together with the\n",
      "marvelous miracles which the divine pity wrought in their favor for\n",
      "the preachers of the gospel. When they returned to Manila from China,\n",
      "where they had suffered so much, the orders of their superior directed\n",
      "them to undertake another longer and more painful voyage, which was\n",
      "to Espana. They were to accompany and assist the bishop, Don Fray\n",
      "Domingo de Salacar, who was going to discuss very important business\n",
      "with his Majesty; and were also to endeavor to bring back religious\n",
      "from Espana, to aid in the great labor which rested upon the religious\n",
      "of this province in the conversion of the heathen of these lands,\n",
      "He did not take for this journey money or anything else, or even more\n",
      "clothes than those which he wore, so that he did not have a change of\n",
      "clothes in the whole voyage, which lasts for six months. A ship is so\n",
      "much an enemy to cleanliness that, when he reached Mexico, his habit\n",
      "was in such a condition that the father prior of the convent in that\n",
      "city was obliged to give him clothes wholly out of charity. During\n",
      "the voyage he fell into the sea and was miraculously brought back to\n",
      "the ship by the Lord at the prayer of the good bishop--who afflicted\n",
      "by the accident, prayed the Lord briefly but devotedly for the remedy\n",
      "of it; and he gained what he desired, for the Lord is very quick to\n",
      "listen to the prayers of His servants. The time between the end of\n",
      "this voyage and that which follows afterward over the Mar del Norte\n",
      "[i.e., Atlantic Ocean] was spent by father Fray Miguel in the convent\n",
      "which offered him hospitality, but without the dispensations which\n",
      "the reception of hospitality usually brings with it. He was the\n",
      "first in the choir and the refectory, and in all the other labor\n",
      "of the convent. In particular he helped in the infirmary, in caring\n",
      "for the sick and serving them, whenever he had an opportunity. This\n",
      "was a charge which he took upon himself when, at the coming of the\n",
      "first founders to the Philippinas, they were guests in this same\n",
      "convent. As at that time he had done well in this service, daily\n",
      "exercising many acts of humility and charity, virtues which are\n",
      "supremely pleasing to God, he would not cease this same conduct on\n",
      "this second occasion; on the contrary, as one that had grown in virtue,\n",
      "he did it better than before. What he did here for the sick religious\n",
      "was not a heavy task [for him], for he had become accustomed to do\n",
      "much more in his hospital at Manila for the Chinese heathen, who are\n",
      "by nature filthy and disgusting. Father Fray Miguel reached Espana,\n",
      "and was present before the royal Council of the Indias, endeavoring\n",
      "to obtain religious for this province as its procurator-general. One\n",
      "of the counselors, incorrectly informed by persons who resented the\n",
      "sermons of our religious, said: \"If the matter were in my hands,\n",
      "the Dominican religious would not be in the Philippinas.\" The rest\n",
      "desired him to restrain himself, and he went on with what he had to\n",
      "say. Father Fray Miguel answered, showing his cloak, which was very\n",
      "old and patched and full of holes: \"So far as concerns ourselves,\n",
      "we have no need to go to the Indias; what we endeavor to do by going\n",
      "there, this cloak tells well enough.\" So well did the cloak of rough,\n",
      "mended serge speak that all were highly edified, and he who had offered\n",
      "opposition was abashed and corrected. In the convent of San Estevan\n",
      "he gave to be washed his inner tunic, which served him in place of a\n",
      "shirt. This was of serge so rough and hard that one of the religious\n",
      "of the convent of novices, who put it on over his habit, was unable to\n",
      "bend any more than if it was a bell; and they all gathered around to\n",
      "look at it as if it were a bell that was sounded. That which began\n",
      "as jest and ridicule so powerfully supplied the place of father\n",
      "Fray Miguel in winning religious, that many determined to go to the\n",
      "province where the religious treated themselves so rigorously and\n",
      "observed such poverty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Father Fray Miguel found an evil doctrine spread abroad in the\n",
      "court, which a member of a religious order [45] had taken pains\n",
      "to introduce. He had come from the Philippinas with documentary\n",
      "authorizations from the bishop and the two cabildos [i.e.,\n",
      "ecclesiastical and civil], before the province of the Holy Rosary\n",
      "was established there, and before there were any Dominican friars\n",
      "in the islands. After having carried on some negotiations at Roma he\n",
      "had returned to the court, and endeavored to bring it about that the\n",
      "preaching of the holy gospel in heathen countries should be begun by\n",
      "soldiers, who by force of weapons and musketry should make the country\n",
      "quiet and subject the Indians, in order that the preachers might do\n",
      "their office immediately without resistance. This doctrine is very\n",
      "well suited to human prudence but is contrary to divine Providence,\n",
      "to that which the Lord has ordained in His gospel, and even to the\n",
      "very nature of the faith, which demands a pious affection in those who\n",
      "hear it. This is not to be acquired as the result of the violences,\n",
      "murders, and conquests wrought by soldiers. On the contrary, as\n",
      "far as in them lies, they make the faith to be hated and abhorred;\n",
      "and hence the Lord commanded that the preachers should be as sheep\n",
      "among wolves, conquering them with patience and humility, which are\n",
      "the proper arms to overcome hearts. Hence not only the apostles,\n",
      "but all the other apostolic preachers who had followed them, have by\n",
      "these means converted all the nations of the earth. This father saw\n",
      "all this very well; but it seemed to him, as indeed he said, that\n",
      "these were old-fashioned arguments and that the world was now very\n",
      "much changed; and that no conversion of importance could or would be\n",
      "made unless soldiers went before to bring into subjection those who\n",
      "were to listen to the gospel, before the preachers preached it. He\n",
      "painted out this monster with such fair colors of rhetoric and with\n",
      "arguments so well suited to our weakness, our little spirit, and our\n",
      "less readiness to suffer for Christ and His gospel, that these lords\n",
      "of the Council were firmly established in this his doctrine--a new\n",
      "doctrine, as its author himself affirmed, and, as such, contrary to\n",
      "the gospel and to the works of the saints who acted in conformity\n",
      "therewith. To overcome this error, much was done by the bishop of\n",
      "the Philippinas and by father Fray Miguel. The latter, being younger,\n",
      "was able to exert himself more; and being so great a theologian and\n",
      "so subtile of mind, he was able to adduce such superior arguments,\n",
      "and so clearly to reveal the poison which was hidden in the arguments\n",
      "of this religious, that the king our lord and his Council were firmly\n",
      "persuaded of the truth. They came to regard it as a great inconsistency\n",
      "to say that our Lord Jesus Christ had acted with so short a view as\n",
      "a legislator that, when He made a law which was to last to the end of\n",
      "the world, He had announced a method which was to be followed only at\n",
      "the beginning by the preachers of it who were present before Him, and\n",
      "not under the same conditions by those who should follow after--just\n",
      "as if His providence were unable to apprehend that which was distant\n",
      "and future. It will further be seen, if we consider it well, that\n",
      "the gospel received much more opposition at the beginning than it\n",
      "does at the present time; and if it was not necessary at that time\n",
      "to subject kingdoms by war, in order to preach the gospel to them,\n",
      "much less will it be so now. Hence grave scandal would arise in the\n",
      "church if, when the Lord commands that gentle sheep shall be the ones\n",
      "to introduce His gospel, the introduction of it should be entrusted\n",
      "now to bloodthirsty wolves. Afterward, by the activity and diligence of\n",
      "father Fray Miguel these black clouds which promised thunderstorms of\n",
      "arquebuses and soldiery were dissipated; and there were left for the\n",
      "promulgation of the gospel the gentle clouds of the preachers, which\n",
      "with the soft rain of teaching, example, and patience have carried the\n",
      "gospel to the most savage and hardened heathen. On this occasion father\n",
      "Fray Miguel displayed such force, and such were his arguments, that the\n",
      "Catholic king directed a most important council to be held, at which\n",
      "were present the president of Castilla, the father-confessors of the\n",
      "princes, the auditors of the Audiencia, the lords of the Indias, and\n",
      "many distinguished theologians. In this conference it was determined\n",
      "that there should be soldiers in the Spanish towns for the defense of\n",
      "the country, but that these soldiers should not go as escorts to the\n",
      "preachers, and that they should not go in advance of them subjugating\n",
      "or killing Indians; for this would be changing into a gospel of\n",
      "war that gospel which Christ our Lord delivered to us--a gospel of\n",
      "peace, love, and grace. So great was the reputation for learning\n",
      "and sanctity which father Fray Miguel gained in these matters that,\n",
      "in the arduous and difficult undertakings which afterward came up,\n",
      "his Majesty directed that he should be consulted and his judgment\n",
      "should be followed, as that of a learned man despising all things\n",
      "which were not of God, and zealous for the good of souls. There was\n",
      "issued at this time a brief of his Holiness to the effect that the\n",
      "bishops of the Indias should have authority to make visitations to\n",
      "the religious who ministered to the Indians, in all matters connected\n",
      "with this ministry, as if they were parish priests. Father Fray Miguel,\n",
      "understanding the bad results which would follow such a plan, presented\n",
      "a very learned memorial, signed by all the procurators of the Indias,\n",
      "to the prince-cardinal Alberto, who gave audience and decided causes\n",
      "for his Majesty. Nothing more was necessary to cause the brief to be\n",
      "recalled, and not to be put into execution. Father Fray Miguel was\n",
      "directed to give the Council of the Indias his advice with regard to\n",
      "the repartimientos of Indians for mines, estates, and the like. He\n",
      "gave it, and it was so sound that they esteemed it highly, the more\n",
      "on account of the character of him who offered it. Hence, when the\n",
      "time came to appoint bishops for these islands he was appointed\n",
      "the first bishop of Nueva Segovia, although such an idea had never\n",
      "crossed his mind, and it was necessary to force him to accept the\n",
      "bishopric. The Council even went so far as to ask him to indicate to\n",
      "them those who seemed to him suitable for the other bishoprics; and\n",
      "those whom he thus indicated were appointed. He sent out religious\n",
      "to the province three times. The first company he sent with father\n",
      "Fray Alonso Delgado, the second with father Fray Pedro Ledesma, and\n",
      "the third, whom he accompanied himself, went under the direction\n",
      "of father Fray Francisco de Morales as vicar, who was afterwards\n",
      "the first minister of our religions order in Japon, and a holy\n",
      "martyr. That he might better prepare the religious for the journey,\n",
      "he went twice from Madrid to Sevilla when he was already a bishop\n",
      "traveling on foot with his staff and his hat like a poor friar; so\n",
      "the people who came to find him and did not know him asked him if he\n",
      "had seen the bishop of Nueva Segovia. He, to avoid vanity, answered\n",
      "them that the bishop was on his way to Sevilla, concealing the fact\n",
      "that it was himself. For the advantage of the inhabitants of Manila,\n",
      "he brought it about that commerce with Nueva Espana was opened to\n",
      "them and that the money which came from their trading was sent back\n",
      "to Manila up to the amount of five hundred thousand pesos in money\n",
      "or silver bullion. Up to that time, they had license only to receive\n",
      "the principal back again; while the profits were retained in Mexico,\n",
      "or were brought back without a license, at great expense. For the\n",
      "Indians he obtained, by a memorial which he offered, that the natural\n",
      "dominion and chieftaincy which they had over their villages should\n",
      "be left to them, with all their lands, mountains and rivers, and the\n",
      "other rights which they had from of old; since the fact that they had\n",
      "become subjects of his Majesty ought not to cause them to lose the\n",
      "natural right which they had inherited from their ancestors. Further,\n",
      "since the conquest of these Philipinas Islands had not been carried\n",
      "out conformably to the holy instructions which the conquerors carried\n",
      "with them, and which they were bound to observe, but had been carried\n",
      "out in exactly the opposite manner and with the most serious acts\n",
      "of injustice, he gave information with regard to these things to\n",
      "his Majesty and to his royal Council of the Indias. It was decreed\n",
      "that the consent and voluntary obedience and allegiance of all the\n",
      "Indians should be asked for anew. The new bishop, Don Fray Miguel,\n",
      "very earnestly undertook to attempt to carry this decree to execution,\n",
      "and accordingly it was made. When the bishop was desirous of embarking,\n",
      "there were so many rumors of enemies, and the damage inflicted at Cadiz\n",
      "was so great, that it was impossible to have any fleet that year; and\n",
      "there was no other vessel for him to travel in except a small patache\n",
      "with a single deck. The cabin in the poop which he occupied was so\n",
      "low that it could not be entered exception on one's knees, while for\n",
      "the twenty religious whom he was taking there was no accommodation\n",
      "at all. He tried, by putting up an awning, to protect them from the\n",
      "sun and the water; but the only one on the ship was full of patches,\n",
      "and very small. The Lord made matters better for them by causing\n",
      "the voyage which they were obliged to take to be very calm, for the\n",
      "patache was not built to encounter storms. It did not rain more than\n",
      "twice, so that they were at least able to lie on the deck at night,\n",
      "though by day they were compelled to suffer the heat of the sun,\n",
      "which was extreme and very oppressive in their little patache. For\n",
      "this the religious gave thanks to the Lord; but the bishop was so\n",
      "accustomed to hardships that this fair weather grieved him; and he\n",
      "said that the Lord had forgotten them because He did not send them\n",
      "hardships, which are the best things which in this life He gives to His\n",
      "friends. \"For my sins,\" he said, \"the Lord deprives us of hardships,\n",
      "and of the merit which they bring with them when they are borne with\n",
      "patience for the love of the Lord who sent them. Not so did we sail\n",
      "on our first journey when so devoted servants of God were going;\n",
      "but we traveled in great and continual afflictions--tempests, fire,\n",
      "and fears of enemies. That we should now lack all this, and travel\n",
      "with such fair weather when we are not such as they, is not for our\n",
      "good. In me is the fault; it is well that I should feel it and weep\n",
      "over it.\" When he went ashore, he traveled on foot all the way to\n",
      "Mexico, and from there to the port of Acapulco, a distance of more\n",
      "than a hundred and fifty leguas. Thus he afforded the example of a\n",
      "poor religious, even when his state as a bishop would have excused\n",
      "him from such poverty and hardship. However, he did not seek for\n",
      "excuses, but for opportunities for poverty and religious devotion,\n",
      "though at the expense of so great an exertion, and in his advanced\n",
      "age. He reached Manila at a time when there happened to be a procession\n",
      "from our convent to the cathedral, because of an occasional need. He\n",
      "disembarked there, at a gate which was near our convent on the shore,\n",
      "and the procession began by receiving him. This caused much joy, on\n",
      "account of the high esteem and regard in which he was held by both\n",
      "religious and laymen. He accompanied the procession to the cathedral,\n",
      "and when the time came he went into the pulpit, taking the sermon\n",
      "from him to whom it had been committed. He preached most eloquently;\n",
      "and, though he came down bathed in perspiration, he did not change\n",
      "the heavy tunic of sackcloth which he wore. On the contrary, he went\n",
      "direct to the sacristy and robed himself to say mass, though he said\n",
      "it very slowly, and with so much feeling that it was a great effort\n",
      "for him. These were acts, and this was an entry, which promised an\n",
      "extremely good bishop and superior. The promise was not falsified, but\n",
      "fell short of the truth, so much did he surpass it. He went straight\n",
      "to his poor bishopric to care for his flock. In the principal part\n",
      "of his diocese, the province of Nueva Segovia, they were nearly all\n",
      "heathen. There were only about two hundred baptized adults, those who\n",
      "were not so being innumerable; for it was only a very short time since\n",
      "our religious had begun to preach the gospel to them. When the new\n",
      "bishop was once among his sheep, he began to watch over their welfare,\n",
      "and to defend them from the alcaldes-mayor and the encomenderos, who\n",
      "abused them like wolves. The bishop's conduct forced him to hear rough\n",
      "words and violent insults from those who had fattened themselves with\n",
      "the blood of the Indians. They feared lest they should grow lean if the\n",
      "shepherd, coming out to the defense of the flock, were to force them\n",
      "to be satisfied with moderate returns, without flaying the sheep. The\n",
      "bishop was not intimidated, and did not desist from this just and due\n",
      "defense; nor did he cease to strive for the good of his Indians against\n",
      "the outrages which he beheld. On the contrary, he strove to give his\n",
      "remonstrances their due effect and if he was unable to succeed there\n",
      "in securing the rights of the Indians, he was accustomed to write to\n",
      "the governor and the Audiencia, without taking his hand from the work\n",
      "until he had brought it to the perfection which he desired. Though he\n",
      "aided the Indians, he did not neglect the Spaniards, who lived in the\n",
      "principal towns of his bishopric less edifying and exemplary lives than\n",
      "those whose Christianity is ancient ought to lead in towns of the newly\n",
      "converted. They are under obligation to be shining lights, to give\n",
      "light to those who are either blind because of their heathen belief,\n",
      "or who know little of God because they have been newly baptized. He\n",
      "stirred them up to live as they ought, and aided them in their\n",
      "necessities like a loving father; if he could not make them such as\n",
      "he wished, he improved them as much as possible. At the death of the\n",
      "archbishop of Manila, he was obliged to go to that city, and saw in\n",
      "it so many things contrary to the divine Majesty and to the human one\n",
      "that he found himself under the necessity of writing to his Majesty\n",
      "a letter very full of feeling, which begins: \"I have twice visited\n",
      "this city of Manila since I came to these islands as bishop. The\n",
      "first time was last year, ninety-nine, because I received reliable\n",
      "information that the governor and the auditors were in such bitter\n",
      "opposition that there was fear of a serious rupture. Now, learning\n",
      "that there was no archbishop in the city, it seemed desirable\" (and\n",
      "was so without doubt) \"that I should be present and prepared for any\n",
      "contingency.\" He gives an account of what had happened, and says: \"I am\n",
      "obliged to speak as my position and the condition of affairs require,\n",
      "very clearly, without caring who may be affected by my words; for God,\n",
      "your Majesty, and the common weal are of more importance than any\n",
      "smaller things.\" The truth of what he stated, and the clearness with\n",
      "which he spoke, are plain in the rest of the letter, which to avoid\n",
      "prolixity is not inserted here. He strove to settle the state of the\n",
      "church in these islands; and when he saw some bad customs introduced\n",
      "without any foundation, and contrary to reason and theology, he was\n",
      "greatly grieved. What he was not himself able to remedy, he wrote\n",
      "of to the supreme pontiff. Since the competency of the bishop was\n",
      "so well known in Espana, he was appointed archbishop as soon as the\n",
      "vacancy was known, although he had no procurator there; for, being a\n",
      "poor and peaceful bishop, he did not expect to carry on any suits,\n",
      "and hence did not care for a procurator or agent at court. Since\n",
      "his poverty was known, his Majesty caused the bulls to be drawn, and\n",
      "directed the royal officials of Manila to collect from the bishop the\n",
      "expense of drawing them when it should be convenient for him to pay\n",
      "it. The bishop hesitated long, and asked the advice of many, before he\n",
      "accepted this promotion, having seen and experienced the difficulties,\n",
      "the opposition, and the dissensions which accompanied this dignity,\n",
      "at such a distance from the eyes of his Majesty and of the supreme\n",
      "pontiff, to whom in difficult cases (of which there were many) he\n",
      "might have had recourse. Yet finally, since all thought that it was\n",
      "desirable for him to accept the office, he was compelled to take it\n",
      "for the public good, although he saw that for his private advantage\n",
      "it would be very injurious. Becoming an archbishop did not change that\n",
      "poor and humble manner of living which he had followed as bishop and as\n",
      "religious. He continued to wear the same habit of serge and tunics of\n",
      "wool. His food was always fish, unless he had a guest, which happened\n",
      "seldom; or unless he was afflicted by some infirmity. Whenever he\n",
      "had a journey to take on land--for traveling in these islands is\n",
      "usually carried on by water--he was accustomed to go on foot; and,\n",
      "that he might travel with more abstraction from the world, he used\n",
      "to walk uttering prayers. He sent the others forward in hammocks\n",
      "or on horseback and he followed after alone, commending to the Lord\n",
      "himself and the undertakings in which he was engaged, in order that\n",
      "they might turn out more satisfactorily. If, when he was indisposed,\n",
      "he was forced by pleadings to go into a hammock--something which is\n",
      "much used in this country, and which is carried by Indians--he used\n",
      "to get out again as soon as he left the town, and sometimes earlier,\n",
      "if he heard any of the carriers groan; for this groan so penetrated\n",
      "his soul that it was not possible for him to travel any farther in\n",
      "this manner. His bed was the same which he had when a poor friar,\n",
      "a mat of rushes or palm-branches on a plank. The small income of his\n",
      "archbishopric he spent in alms; and he used to delight in giving them\n",
      "with his own hands, kissing the alms with great devotion as if he\n",
      "were giving them to Christ, who has said that He receives them when\n",
      "they are given in His name to the poor. That the principal door of his\n",
      "house might not cause embarrassments to persons who had known better\n",
      "days and who were under the necessity of asking alms, he had another\n",
      "door for these persons which was always open, so that they might come\n",
      "at any time to tell him their troubles, and that he might relieve\n",
      "them as well as possible. In this way he spent all his income, and\n",
      "therefore had very little expense or ostentation in his household. He\n",
      "never had a mule or a chair to go about with, avoiding all this that\n",
      "he might have means to give to the poor. He was most devoted to the\n",
      "ministry and instruction of the Indians and the Chinese; and, whenever\n",
      "he had an opportunity for doing so, he used to aid in it with great\n",
      "pleasure. He envied much those who were occupied in so meritorious an\n",
      "exercise, as he wrote in the last year of his life to those whom he\n",
      "had left behind in Nueva Segovia, in a letter which reads as follows:\n",
      "\"To my fathers and brethren, the religious of the Order of St. Dominic\n",
      "in Nueva Segovia. A poor brother of your Reverences, very weak in\n",
      "health and very full of troubles and of his own wretchedness, has\n",
      "written this to your Reverences, his truest brethren, who are walking\n",
      "about in those places of rest and new fields of the true paradise,\n",
      "feeding the flocks of the Great Shepherd and rejoicing your souls\n",
      "with the sports and the gambols which the new-born lambs are making\n",
      "upon the hill-sides at the dawn of the true sun. May your Reverences\n",
      "refresh yourselves and feed upon that celestial milk which creates\n",
      "manna covered with honey upon those mountains. May you rejoice in the\n",
      "fair season that now is; for I once tasted the same pleasures--though\n",
      "the fair weather lasted but for a short time for me, because of my\n",
      "sins and my pride; and now I see myself wretched as no one else is\n",
      "wretched. Happy the father provincial, who, having seen as from the\n",
      "parapet of a bull-ring something of the wounds and the bulls here,\n",
      "has returned so soon to the delights of that region, and is among\n",
      "his sheep. I refer you to him; let him speak the love which I have\n",
      "for every one of your Reverences and the esteem which I feel for you\n",
      "all. Pay me with the money of love and pity. Valete in Domino, viscera\n",
      "mea, felices valete in aeternum. [46] To all the Indians, a thousand\n",
      "greetings; and I beg their prayers for this poor soul.\" His life was\n",
      "continually burdened with scruples which sometimes are more cruel\n",
      "enemies than those who are openly declared as such. They were not born\n",
      "in him from ignorance, but from his great depreciation of himself and\n",
      "from his looking upon the greatness of God, both of which caused him to\n",
      "be always timid. This, as he said, was the counterweight with which the\n",
      "Lord burdened him that he might not be puffed up by the great blessings\n",
      "which the Lord had granted him. He preached continually, that he might\n",
      "the better advise and direct his sheep. He grieved for the poor much;\n",
      "and over sinners he was a Jeremiah, weeping for what they failed to\n",
      "lament, that he might make them weep. He was deeply versed in sacred\n",
      "scripture, and with it he filled his writings, and even the ordinary\n",
      "letters which he wrote. In the opinions which he gave, everything was\n",
      "founded upon and approved by the divine authority, which was his rule\n",
      "and his arms, both offensive and defensive. He was accustomed to read\n",
      "with great care the sacred councils and canons of the church. In them\n",
      "he found stated with the greatest precision everything of which he had\n",
      "need for the government of his church, as well as for the satisfactory\n",
      "decision of the questions with regard to which they asked his opinion,\n",
      "and of the disputes which arose among learned persons. When there\n",
      "were different opinions among such persons, he was accustomed to say,\n",
      "\"Veritas liberabit nos [i.e., \"the truth shall make us free\"], and\n",
      "this will make clear to us that for which we seek; let us follow\n",
      "it and strive for it.\" This confidence was always justified; for on\n",
      "many occasions when it seemed that the whole world was in a tumult,\n",
      "and that justice was certain to be clouded over and obscured, he was\n",
      "then accustomed to say, with the greatest confidence, \"The truth shall\n",
      "make us free,\" and finally it turned out so. Because of the love which\n",
      "he had for truth, he could not endure to hear new opinions; and if\n",
      "they were opposed to the doctrine of the ancient saints, he attacked\n",
      "them like a lion set on fire, though he was in all other things as\n",
      "gentle as a lamb. For the same cause, he was most devoted to the\n",
      "teaching of St. Thomas--who, like a mystic bee, made the honeycomb\n",
      "of his works from the flowers of holy scripture, sacred councils,\n",
      "sacred canons, and the works of the saints whom the Lord gave to His\n",
      "church as teachers and guides for its direction. In order that in the\n",
      "Philippinas so sound and safe a doctrine should be read, he strove\n",
      "greatly that in the province, although the numbers were so few, there\n",
      "should always be some one to read St. Thomas. As soon as he entered\n",
      "upon his archbishopric, he asked for a religious of our order to read\n",
      "in the cathedral to those who had been ordained; and carefully took\n",
      "pains to encourage and favor those who went to listen, so that the\n",
      "rest should imitate them. This desire he retained up to his death;\n",
      "and hence in his last sickness he gave the little which he had, asking\n",
      "the order to build a college for this purpose. With this beginning,\n",
      "which was of the value of a thousand pesos, was established the college\n",
      "which we now have in Manila under the advocacy of St. Thomas, in order\n",
      "that from their first letters the students may feel an affection to\n",
      "this holy doctrine, and may follow him afterward when they are further\n",
      "advanced. The devotion which Don Fray Miguel felt for our Lady was\n",
      "so great that in everything which he did or said he commended it\n",
      "to her, saying an Ave Maria before he began. So scrupulous was he\n",
      "that he was unable to say the Ave Maria unless he understood all\n",
      "the circumstances; and even if it occupied a considerable time for\n",
      "him to repeat it, still, in spite of this, he always said it. One\n",
      "day the dean of his church, Don Francisco de Arellano--a man whom,\n",
      "on account of his virtue, the bishop loved and esteemed--asked what\n",
      "was the beginning of this devotion, and whence it was derived. He\n",
      "answered that our Lady herself, to whom at first he had said the Ave\n",
      "Maria, was the beginning, and that she it was who had taught him this\n",
      "devotion. The dean remained in wonder, and did not dare to ask him\n",
      "more on this point; nor did the good archbishop ever make any further\n",
      "declaration. Hence the mode in which this happened was never known; but\n",
      "the great attention which he gave to it was seen. Whenever there was\n",
      "anything to be done the Ave Maria always preceded. It was said before\n",
      "he answered or put a question, or took any medicine, or gave alms,\n",
      "or did anything else. Thus always all his acts were actually referred\n",
      "to God our Lord, and to His most holy Mother. This was a custom of the\n",
      "highest virtue; but when the business was of unusual weight, he was\n",
      "not contented with an Ave Maria, but recited a rosary. Thus he did in\n",
      "China, when the judges caused him to write a petition in their presence\n",
      "in Chinese characters--something which far exceeded his powers, but\n",
      "not those of the Virgin. Accordingly he wrote a miraculous petition,\n",
      "to the satisfaction of the judges. They believed that which they saw\n",
      "to be impossible, as it really was; for though father Fray Miguel knew\n",
      "some of the commoner Chinese letters, he did not understand those\n",
      "which were necessary for what was then required of him, since they\n",
      "were extremely peculiar and were in the judicial style, with which\n",
      "he was not acquainted. Hence this was doubtless a miraculous event,\n",
      "worthy of the compassion with which this great Lady comes to the aid of\n",
      "her afflicted devotees. The sufferings of the archbishop from storms\n",
      "at sea, as well as from the opposition of clergymen and laymen with\n",
      "disrespectful words and acts, were very great, but were the cause\n",
      "of great happiness. As was affirmed by his confessor--a religious\n",
      "of great virtue, a man who had known him for many years and who was\n",
      "familiar with the secrets of his soul--when the sufferings were at\n",
      "their greatest, and in his sorrow and affliction he went to God, our\n",
      "Lord himself visibly consoled him and gave him strength, not once,\n",
      "but often. To this was attributed his habit of looking sometimes with\n",
      "his eyes fixed on heaven, with flames of fire, as it were, shining\n",
      "upon his face. On such occasions he was heard to utter some words\n",
      "which, without his striving or having power to say more, he spoke in\n",
      "affectionate converse with God. This caused great devotion in those\n",
      "who heard; and as it was so, it is no wonder that he so much desired\n",
      "other sufferings in addition to the weighty cross of his scruples,\n",
      "because their absence was much more painful to him than the necessity\n",
      "of enduring them. Hence he showed much more sadness and melancholy\n",
      "when he was exposed to no hardships than when they were heaped upon\n",
      "him; for in the latter case he was sure of the consolation of heaven,\n",
      "which was lacking when he had no sufferings.\n",
      "\n",
      "The end of his days finally approached; and as he lay on his bed\n",
      "it was plain to him that this was his last sickness, and he began\n",
      "to prepare for this important journey. At his departure he was much\n",
      "afflicted to leave without a minister the Indians of Marivelez, which\n",
      "is situated at no great distance from Manila. Since these Indians\n",
      "were few and by themselves, he had found no one who was willing to\n",
      "accept the charge of them. Taking advantage of the present occasion,\n",
      "he sent for father Fray Miguel de San Jacintho, who at that time was\n",
      "provincial of the province, and most energetically begged him to urge\n",
      "on his religious to give instruction to these poor Indians. When the\n",
      "provincial promised that he would do all he could for this purpose,\n",
      "the bishop remained in great content, as if there were nothing now to\n",
      "cause him sorrow. He divided his poor treasures, sending part of them\n",
      "immediately to his church, and giving part to our Lady of the Rosary,\n",
      "and part to the poor. In his illness he did not complain or ask for\n",
      "anything; and when he was asked if he wished or longed for anything,\n",
      "he answered, \"I desire to be saved.\" His face was very full of joy,\n",
      "and the words which he uttered came forth kindled so by the love of\n",
      "God that they showed plainly what a fire of love was in the breast\n",
      "where they were forged. He asked them to dress him in his habit;\n",
      "and on the coming of the festival of the glorious St. Anne in the\n",
      "year 1605 he asked them to get ready his pontifical robes, as if he\n",
      "were preparing to go out on that festal day. This was as much as to\n",
      "say that his departure was at hand. He was surrounded by his friars,\n",
      "and though they saw him joyful they themselves were very sad to\n",
      "perceive that they were to be deprived of such a superior and such\n",
      "a religious. He consoled them with loving words, and, perceiving\n",
      "that his departure was at hand he called fervently upon his special\n",
      "patroness, the Virgin, his guardian angel, our father St. Dominic,\n",
      "and the other saints of his devotion, with whom he spoke as if he were\n",
      "already with them in heaven. His countenance appeared to be celestial\n",
      "rather than to belong to earth; and amid loving converse with God,\n",
      "with His most holy Mother, and with the saints, his soul departed\n",
      "to his Lord, leaving his body, as many said, fragrant with the odor\n",
      "of roses. By the voice of all, he was given the palm of a virgin,\n",
      "as if all had heard him in confession and felt the certainty which\n",
      "his confessor had and manifested in this respect, although this\n",
      "declaration was made after that in which the palm had been given to\n",
      "him as to a virgin. When the fathers of St. Francis came, father Fray\n",
      "Vicente Valero, who lived and died with the reputation of sainthood,\n",
      "went up to the dead man, saying, \"This body is holy and should\n",
      "be regarded as such,\" and kissed the feet. After this all of his\n",
      "religious did the same thing, and they were followed by the others,\n",
      "for in this way the Lord honors those who faithfully serve Him. His\n",
      "interment was performed with all possible solemnity in the cathedral,\n",
      "on the epistle side near the high altar. The archbishop left behind\n",
      "him some writings of much erudition, and full of Christian teaching,\n",
      "which are very helpful to the ministers of the holy gospel.\n",

      "CHAPTER LXII\n",
      "\n",
      "Of some religious who died at this time\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "[At this time there were taken away by death a number of the most\n",
      "superior religious, the lack of whom was greatly felt. In the year\n",
      "of our Lord 1604 one of the definitors in the provincial chapter was\n",
      "father Fray Pedro de San Vicente. He was elected as a definitor in\n",
      "the general chapter, and also as procurator of the province at the\n",
      "courts of Espana and Roma. There was no one at either court at that\n",
      "time, and a procurator was necessary, especially for the purpose of\n",
      "bringing over religious from Espana, without whom this province could\n",
      "not be maintained. He set out to undertake the duties entrusted to him,\n",
      "in the ships which sailed that year for Nueva Espana, and died on the\n",
      "way, the same ships in the following year bringing back the news of\n",
      "his death. Father Fray Pedro was a native of Zalamea. He assumed the\n",
      "habit in the convent of San Esteban at Salamanca, whence he came to\n",
      "this province in the year 1594. Here he was engaged in the ministry\n",
      "of Bataan, and afterward in the ministry to the Chinese of Binondoc,\n",
      "being much beloved and esteemed in both these offices. He always\n",
      "thought well of all, and never spoke ill of anyone. He was twice\n",
      "superior of Binondoc, to the great spiritual and temporal augmentation\n",
      "of that mission. He set sail on the voyage without taking a real or\n",
      "a piece of silk, or any other thing, either for the journey or for\n",
      "the business which fell to his charge, trusting solely in the divine\n",
      "Providence. He even refused to take for his convent some articles\n",
      "of little value here, but esteemed as rare and curious in Espana,\n",
      "and such as it is customary for a religious to take as a mark of\n",
      "affection to the convent where he assumed the habit. When he died\n",
      "he made the following testament or declaration: \"I, Fray Pedro de\n",
      "San Vicente, declare that I die as a friar of St. Dominic, without\n",
      "having in my possession gold or silver, or anything else, except one\n",
      "old blanket with which I cover myself at night. I pray for the love\n",
      "of God that this may be given to a boy who travels with me, named\n",
      "Andresillo.\" Let it be remembered that father Fray Pedro was in the\n",
      "Philippinas ten years, for the greater part of the time minister to\n",
      "the Chinese and for four years their vicar, and that he was very much\n",
      "beloved; that they are of their nature inclined to make presents;\n",
      "that many in this town are very rich, and are ready to give much on\n",
      "small occasions; and that when they saw him about to go to Espana\n",
      "they were much more likely to show generosity, without his needing\n",
      "to put forward any effort. Any one who will consider these things,\n",
      "and who will observe that he went from among them so poor, without\n",
      "money or anything else, will clearly recognize his great virtue, and\n",
      "see how justly he is entitled to the great praise of the Holy Spirit,\n",
      "who says, \"Happy is he who does not follow after gold, and who does\n",
      "not put his trust in the treasures of money; who is he? let us praise\n",
      "him because he has wrought marvels in his life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In the province of Nueva Segovia there died at this time father Fray\n",
      "Jacintho Pardo, a learned theologian and a virtuous religious. He was a\n",
      "native of Cuellar and took the habit in San Pablo at Valladolid. He was\n",
      "so much beloved in the convent that the elder fathers strove to retain\n",
      "him; but it was shown in a vision to a devout woman that father Fray\n",
      "Jacintho was to serve among the heathen.] He was sent to Nueva Segovia,\n",
      "where there were very many heathen to be converted; for at that time\n",
      "missionaries had just been sent there, and nearly the whole of the\n",
      "province was without them. The natives were fierce, constantly causing\n",
      "alarm from warlike disturbances, and were much given to idolatry and\n",
      "to the vices which accompany it. The good fortune of going thither\n",
      "fell to him; and he immediately learned the ordinary language of that\n",
      "province so perfectly that he was the first to compose a grammar of\n",
      "it. Since the village of Tuguegarao (where he lived) in La Yrraya had,\n",
      "although the inhabitants understood this common and general language,\n",
      "another particular language of their own, in which it pleased them\n",
      "better to hear and answer, he undertook the labor of learning that\n",
      "also, and succeeded very well. He acted thus as one desirous in all\n",
      "ways of attracting them to Christ, without giving any consideration\n",
      "to his own labor, and to the fact that this language could be of\n",
      "no use outside of this village. They were a warlike, ferocious, and\n",
      "wrathful tribe; and, being enraged against their Spanish encomendero,\n",
      "they killed him, and threatened the religious that they would take his\n",
      "life unless he left the village. Being enraged, and having declared\n",
      "war against the Spaniards, they did not wish to see him among them. But\n",
      "father Fray Jacintho, who loved them for the sake of God more than for\n",
      "his own life, desired to bring them to a reconciliation and to peace;\n",
      "and was unwilling to leave the village, in spite of their threats. To\n",
      "him indeed they were not threats, but promises of something which he\n",
      "greatly desired. Under these circumstances he fell sick, and in a few\n",
      "days ended his life. The Spaniards, knowing what the Indians had said,\n",
      "believed that they had given him poison so that he should not preach to\n",
      "them or reconcile them with the Spaniards; and this opinion was shared\n",
      "by the physician, because of his very speedy death. If this were true,\n",
      "it was a happy death which he suffered in such a holy cause. He died on\n",
      "the day of the eleven thousand virgins, to whom he showed a particular\n",
      "devotion; and it might have been a reward to him to die on such a day,\n",
      "since the church knows by experience the great protection which these\n",
      "saints offer at that time to those who are devoted to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "[In the district of Bataan died Father Juan de la Cruz, a son of the\n",
      "convent of San Pablo at Sevilla. He was one of the first founders of\n",
      "this province, in which he lived for eighteen years. He was small of\n",
      "body, and weak and delicate in constitution; but his zeal gave him\n",
      "strength for the great labors which accompanied the beginning of this\n",
      "conversion. He was one of the first workers in the field of Pangasinan,\n",
      "where he suffered all the evils and miseries which have been described\n",
      "in the account of that conversion. He very rapidly learned the\n",
      "language of these Indians, which they call Tagala; and succeeded\n",
      "so perfectly with it that father Fray Francisco San Joseph, who was\n",
      "afterwards the best linguist there was, profited by the papers and\n",
      "labors of father Fray Juan de la Cruz. Father Fray Juan even learned\n",
      "afterward two other Indian languages, those of the Zambales and the\n",
      "Pampangos. Father Fray Juan, being the only linguist among the fathers,\n",
      "was called upon constantly to hear confessions; and therefore suffered\n",
      "even more than the rest from the exposures of traveling from place to\n",
      "place in this district. These hardships broke down the health even of\n",
      "strong men like father Fray Christobal de Salvatierra, who suffered\n",
      "from a terrible asthma. Father Fray Juan was afflicted by an asthma so\n",
      "terrible that it seemed as if every night must be his last; and he felt\n",
      "the dreadful anxiety which accompanies this disease. He also suffered\n",
      "from two other diseases even more severe, colic and urinary ailments,\n",
      "which afflicted him even more than the asthma. He was so patient and\n",
      "so angelic in nature that all these diseases and afflictions could\n",
      "not disturb him or make him irritable. His body he treated like a\n",
      "wild beast that had to be tamed, weakening it with fasts, binding\n",
      "it with chains, mortifying it with hair-shirts, and chastising it\n",
      "with scourgings. He was chosen as confessor by the archbishop of\n",
      "Manila, Don Fray Miguel de Venavides. Immediately after the death\n",
      "of the archbishop he returned to his labors among the Indians, but\n",
      "did not survive long. When a religious of the Order of St. Dominic\n",
      "is about to breathe his last, the rest of the convent gather about\n",
      "him to aid him to die well; and to call them together some boards\n",
      "are struck or a rattle is sounded, he who strikes them repeating,\n",
      "\"Credo, credo.\" Father Fray Juan de la Cruz, desiring to follow the\n",
      "usual custom of the order, taught an Indian to strike together these\n",
      "boards, although the father was alone in the village; and this was the\n",
      "last farewell of this noble religious. He had refused repeated requests\n",
      "to return to Manila for care; and he was buried, as he desired, in the\n",
      "church of those Indians for whose spiritual good he had spent his life.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this year 1605 the religious of our order had been three years\n",
      "in Japon. They were not a little disturbed by a brief which at this\n",
      "time reached Japon and which had been obtained by the fathers of\n",
      "the Society of Jesus. This brief directed that all the religious and\n",
      "secular clergy who desired to preach in Japon might go thither by the\n",

      "reconsideration. They declared that it was unreasonable to expect\n",
      "them to leave Japon until the reply of the supreme pontiff should\n",

      "only three years after the petition; and this repeal was confirmed\n",
      "afterwards by Urban VIII. In the interim the fathers of the Society\n",
      "of Jesus did things which annoyed the other religious, but were not\n",
      "sufficient to drive them from Japon. After the repeal the superior\n",

      "Alonso de Mena to extend the mission from Satzuma to Vomura [i.e.,\n",

      "On April 16, 1606, an intermediate chapter was held in Manila,\n",
      "at which notice was given of the brief of Pope Clement VIII, De\n",

      "all memorable things, worthy of being placed in history, which had\n",
      "happened in this province should be diligently gathered together. In\n",
      "accordance with this, the father provincial gave a formal precept\n",
      "to all the religious of the province that they should write down,\n",
      "each one of them, what he knew in regard to this matter with all\n",
      "accuracy and truth. In this way something of that which has here\n",

      "On the first of April in this year occurred the glorious victory which\n",
      "Don Pedro de Acuna, knight of the Habit of St. John, knight-commander\n",
      "of Salamanca, governor and captain-general of these islands, gained\n",
      "in the Malucas, restoring them to the crown of Espana, as for many\n",

      "reputation and glory of the great soldier and devout cavalier who\n",
      "gained them during his government. He deserves this glory not less\n",

      "of the Rosary--in which from his tenderest years he was bred by his\n",
      "most devout and prudent mother--than for his great military skill and\n",
      "prudence, which he and all his valorous brothers acquired from his\n",
      "father, a distinguished and most fortunate captain, as also he saw all\n",
      "his sons become. The great favor which our Lady of the Rosary showed to\n",
      "our army in this conquest was very well known and celebrated. That the\n",
      "evidence of it might be more clearly made known to those who were not\n",
      "present [at the victory], a formal narrative of the matter was made\n",
      "before the treasurer Don Luis de Herrera Sandoval, vicar-general of\n",
      "this archiepiscopate in the year 1609. Many witnesses being examined,\n",
      "all agreed that this fort was gained by the miraculous aid of the\n",
      "Virgin, though the soldiers did not on that account fight the less\n",
      "valiantly. It was plain, in many things that happened, that sovereign\n",
      "assistance was given by this Lady, as may be seen by referring to\n",
      "the statement of the first witness, the sargento-mayor of that army,\n",
      "Christobal de Azcueta Menchaca, who was present throughout the whole\n",
      "matter; and, who on account of his position, had better knowledge\n",
      "of what occurred than anyone else in the army. His statement is as\n",
      "follows: \"In the month of February, 1606, the governor was at Oton,\n",
      "four leguas from the town of Arebalo, in the bishopric of Zebu, on\n",
      "his way to the conquest of Maluco--where the Dutch had built a fort,\n",
      "and had made treaties of peace with the king of that country against\n",
      "the Castilians and Portuguese. It was also said that they had invaded\n",
      "the country of the king of Tidore, our ally. The governor mustered\n",
      "his forces at Oton; and with those who had come from Mexico in June,\n",
      "and those who had been added in these islands, the total number was\n",
      "thirteen hundred Spanish infantry, and six hundred Indians from the\n",
      "vicinity of Manila, who fought courageously under the protection of the\n",
      "Spaniards. Religious of all orders accompanied the troops, and among\n",
      "them was a certain father Fray Andres of the Order of St. Dominic,\n",
      "with another lay religious. As if by legitimate inheritance from their\n",
      "father, all the friars of this habit had in their charge the devotion\n",
      "to the Holy Rosary; and hence father Fray Andres suggested to the\n",
      "sargento-mayor that her holy confraternity should be established in\n",
      "this army, that this our Lady might open the door to the difficult\n",
      "entrance they were to make. The sargento-mayor spoke to the governor\n",
      "in regard to the matter, and to the holy bishop of Zebu, Don Fray Pedro\n",
      "de Agurto. The sargento-mayor received permission to discuss it in the\n",
      "army, and the captains and soldiers all agreed with great heartiness;\n",
      "and they determined that the holy confraternity should be immediately\n",
      "established, with all its ceremonies and ordinances, so that this\n",
      "important enterprise might begin with some service done to our Lady the\n",
      "Virgin. The governor ordered the image of our Lady of the Rosary to be\n",
      "embroidered on the royal standard, that she might guide the army. He\n",
      "was the first to pledge himself as a member of the confraternity, and\n",
      "was followed by the master-of-camp, Juan de Esquivel, and the captains,\n",
      "the soldiers and sailors, and the members of his household--all of\n",
      "them promising alms when they should be provided with money on account\n",
      "of their pay. It was then proposed to establish the confraternity in\n",
      "the first city which should be gained from the enemy, and to call it\n",
      "\"the City of the Rosary.\" For this purpose a canvas was painted,\n",
      "having upon it a representation of our Lady with her son Jesus in\n",
      "her arms, distributing rosaries to the governor, the master-of-camp,\n",
      "the captains, and the rest of the soldiers. They confessed and\n",
      "received communion, and went in procession, as is customary when the\n",
      "confraternity is established. The bishop celebrated pontifical mass,\n",
      "giving dignity to this solemn act with his holy presence. According\n",
      "to the ordinances, a Dominican friar is obliged to preach if any be\n",
      "present. Since Fray Andres had little skill in this office, and spoke\n",
      "with little grace, he tried to arrange that the bishop should preach;\n",
      "but matters turned out so that the religious was obliged to preach\n",
      "the great things of the Mother of God and of her rosary. As all this\n",
      "had been guided by God, and the preacher chosen by His own will, God\n",
      "controlled the preacher's tongue in such a manner that all should be\n",
      "fulfilled which concerned His purpose. Thus the father amazed those\n",
      "who were present--the bishop to such an extent that he said aloud to\n",
      "the whole congregation: \"Gentlemen this blessed father has preached\n",
      "in such a manner that it seems the Holy Spirit has been dictating to\n",
      "him that which he has said; and I do not know what account to give of\n",
      "the same except to praise God, for it is He who caused it.\" The fleet\n",
      "sailed to Tidore; and when it reached there the forces spent Holy Week\n",
      "in confessing and receiving communion. While they were there an eclipse\n",
      "of the moon occurred, which was taken by the augurs of the island\n",
      "as a bad omen, and they uttered presages of evil, and cried aloud;\n",
      "but the Spaniards took it as an omen of victory. They did not find in\n",
      "Tidore the king, who was friendly. They discovered two Dutchmen who\n",
      "had a factory there; and they and that which was in the factory were\n",
      "held for the king of Espana. On Friday of Easter week, which was the\n",
      "last day of March, the fleet cast anchor a cannon-shot from the fort\n",
      "of Ternate; and on Saturday the artillery from the ships and galleys\n",
      "was fired, to clear the field. The sargento-mayor made a landing with\n",
      "the army, drawing them up along the creek between the fort and the\n",
      "sea. The vanguard was held by the master-of-camp, Gallinato, lookouts\n",
      "being posted in the trees. While he was planning to make gabions, the\n",
      "tumult of the army, as if the voice of all, declared that they should\n",
      "not doubt the victory; that on that very day they were going to capture\n",
      "the fort and the country, for it was Saturday, a day dedicated to our\n",
      "Lady. They began with great readiness. It was about midday, an hour\n",
      "little suited for an attack in so hot a country, for the sun beat down\n",
      "on them. In addition, on one side they were harassed by falcon-shots\n",
      "fired from the fort of Cachitulco; it was a very effective weapon,\n",
      "although at first they shot their balls too high. After lowering\n",
      "their aim somewhat, they struck seven Spaniards. The companions\n",
      "of the governor forced him to move to another place, as balls were\n",
      "constantly striking where he was. At the very moment when he left the\n",
      "spot, his shield-bearer, stepping into his place, was struck. On this\n",
      "account the sargento-mayor endeavored to hold back the forces until\n",
      "they could hear what the lookouts said, or receive an order from\n",
      "the governor. From among the body of the troops he heard a voice,\n",
      "calling upon him to attack without doubting of the victory; that the\n",
      "mother of God purposed that on that day her holy confraternity should\n",
      "be established in this country. The sargento-mayor turned his head\n",
      "and asked in a loud voice: \"What devout or holy person has said this\n",
      "to us?\" There was no answer, and it was not known from whom the voice\n",
      "proceeded; but it seemed to him that it spoke to him from within, and\n",
      "that it came from heaven. It inspired in him such spirit and courage\n",
      "that he turned to the captains and said: \"Gentlemen, the mother of\n",
      "God wills us to gain this fort today.\" Captain Cubas reached the fort,\n",
      "from which his troops were somewhat driven back by the Moros, and his\n",
      "foot was wounded by a pointed stake [puia]. Some beginning to call\n",
      "\"Sanctiago!\" and others \"Victory!\" they all began to run on boldly\n",
      "and proudly without any order. So quickly was the fort taken that the\n",
      "captain-general did not even know it when the soldiers had actually\n",
      "surmounted the wall. They went on to where the king was fortified,\n",
      "with many arquebuses and culverins; and with four pieces of ordnance\n",
      "(piecas de batir), and with a high wall, from which the enemy did\n",
      "much execution with bucacaos [48] and fire-hardened reeds anointed\n",
      "with poison. But none of these things availed him; and, seeing that\n",
      "the day was lost he fled with some of his followers, in a caracoa\n",
      "and four xuangas, to the island of the Moro, or Batachina [i.e.,\n",
      "Gilolo], to which they had sent their women and children and their\n",
      "wealth. On account of this the sack did not bring very much gold or\n",
      "money, but amounted to only two thousand ducats and some cloth and\n",
      "cloves. The rest of the prize was artillery, culverins, arms, and\n",
      "ammunition. After the victory, the sargento-mayor went to ask the\n",
      "governor for the countersign, and found him on his knees before an\n",
      "image of our Lady, saying: \"I beg humility of you, our Lady, since\n",
      "by you this victory has been gained.\" On the following day, Sunday,\n",
      "the second of April (which was, accordingly, the first Sunday in the\n",
      "month), the governor ordered an altar to be prepared, and directed\n",
      "that the painting we carried of the mother of God of the Rosary,\n",
      "with the governor, the captains and the men at her feet should be\n",
      "placed thereon, so that mass might be said. They brought from the\n",
      "mosque a pulpit, in which father Fray Andres preached. That which\n",
      "had previously been a mosque was from that day forth the parish\n",
      "church and mother church--the religious living in one part of it, and\n",
      "administering the holy sacrament. The confraternity was established,\n",
      "and it and the city and the principal fort received the name of El\n",
      "Rosario [i.e., \"The Rosary\"] that this signal mercy might remain in\n",
      "the memory of those who were to come. In these events there were many\n",
      "things that appeared miraculous. The first of them was the voice which\n",
      "the sargento-mayor heard, with regard to which he declared upon oath\n",
      "that he could not find out who spoke it, that it appeared to speak\n",
      "to him within, and that the words inspired in him great confidence,\n",
      "as has been said. The second miraculous element is the speed with\n",
      "which victory was attained; for when the governor went away to speak,\n",
      "with the king of Tidore, who is friendly, the report that the fort\n",
      "had been gained reached him so quickly that the governor was amazed,\n",
      "and the king did not believe it. The third was the few deaths which\n",
      "occurred on our side; for only fifteen died in the war, and twenty\n",
      "were wounded. The fourth is that when a Dutchman--or, as others say,\n",
      "a man of Terrenate--was trying to fire a large paterero to clear a\n",
      "straight path where a great number of our soldiers were marching up\n",
      "hill in close order, he tried three times to fire it with a linstock,\n",
      "but was unable to do so. When the Moros told him to hasten and fire\n",
      "it, he said that a lady with a blue mantle was preventing him with\n",
      "a corner of the mantle, and sprinkling sand in the touch-hole. So,\n",
      "throwing away the linstock, he began to run; and the Spaniards came\n",
      "up with him and killed him.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the beginning of August in the same year, large reenforcements\n",
      "of religious came from Espana; and so great was the need which there\n",
      "was of them that they came at a very fortunate time, especially since\n",
      "they were picked men in virtue and learning. The first who volunteered\n",
      "for this province were five members of the college of Sancto Thomas\n",
      "at Alcala, which event attracted so much attention in the convent of\n",
      "San Estevan at Salamanca that, when the vicar of the religious reached\n",
      "there, thirteen members of that convent volunteered. Among them was\n",
      "the preacher of that distinguished convent, father Fray Diego del\n",
      "Aguila. To these, others from other convents added themselves, and\n",
      "a member of the college of San Gregorio, of whose great virtue an\n",
      "account will immediately be given. When the time for beginning the\n",
      "voyage arrived, the thirteen members of the order from the convent\n",
      "of San Estevan at Salamanca prostrated themselves on the floor of\n",
      "the church, after thanks had been returned for the meal which had\n",
      "been completed, and asked for the blessing of the superior that they\n",
      "might begin their journey. This act aroused great devotion among\n",
      "those who were present. When they had received the blessing, they\n",
      "went in procession to the convent of novices, where they took their\n",
      "cloaks and bags; and intoning the devout hymn of the Holy Spirit, they\n",
      "began with His divine support upon this journey, with their staves and\n",
      "hempen sandals, after the manner of persons who go on foot. They were\n",
      "led by father Fray Diego del Aguila, the preacher of that convent at\n",
      "the time, and an example of virtue in that city where he had preached\n",
      "with great reputation for the four years preceding. Hence to see him\n",
      "walking on foot, and on his way to regions so remote, was a thing\n",
      "which caused great tenderness and devotion in those who knew him, and\n",
      "who saw so devout and so humble an act, so determined a resignation,\n",
      "and such contempt for the world. He labored much in the ship, hearing\n",
      "confessions, and preaching and teaching; for as in voyages there are\n",
      "so many kinds of people, there is need of all of these things, while\n",
      "many of the people need them all at once, because they do not know the\n",
      "doctrine which it is their duty to know and believe, and do not take\n",
      "that care of their souls which they ought to take. Some of them do\n",
      "not even desire to have such things spoken of, that their ignorance\n",
      "may not be known; and hence there is much labor in teaching them,\n",
      "and it is a great service to God not to refuse this labor.\n",
      "\n",
      "[The member of the college of San Gregorio at Valladolid who came\n",
      "with the rest of these religious was Fray Pedro Rodriguez, a native\n",
      "of Montilla and a son of the convent of San Pablo at Cordoba. His\n",
      "departure caused much grief. His parents loved him tenderly, for he\n",
      "was, like Benjamin, the youngest and was very obedient and docile by\n",
      "nature. The religious of his convent were grieved because they had\n",
      "seen in him so notable a beginning in virtue and letters. In spite\n",
      "of the efforts of fathers, kinsmen, and religious, father Fray Pedro\n",
      "maintained his resolve. His virtues were very great, and he mortified\n",
      "himself constantly. His last illness befell him when the vessel had\n",
      "already come among these islands; and they were already at the port\n",
      "of Ybalon, and were carrying him ashore that he might receive the\n",
      "viaticum, when he lost consciousness. He had desired to be left in\n",
      "the islands of the Ladrones, that he might serve as missionary; but\n",
      "he was not permitted to do so, on account of the great difficulties\n",
      "which he would have met with because of ignorance of the language. It\n",
      "may be that father Fray Pedro would have overcome them; but such things\n",
      "ought not to be left in the hands of a single person. The evil results\n",
      "which follow are morally worse than the gain which may be expected,\n",
      "as has been found out by experience since religious of the seraphic\n",

      "were obliged to spend six, or eight, or even fifteen years without\n",
      "confessing, while some of them had not seen a confessor within\n",
      "forty years. Hence the fathers Fray Thomas and Fray Alonso were\n",
      "anxious to go up into the country to continue the good work which\n",
      "they had begun. The vicar-provincial, Fray Francisco de Morales,\n",
      "sent father Fray Alonso de Mena to the kingdom of Fixen, [49] where\n",
      "there had been no church up to this year 1606. A certain captain,\n",

      "a journey, and on the voyage had been delivered from great danger by\n",

      "many gifts, refusing to accept anything in return except a chain. The\n",
      "king showed him such favor that the captain took advantage of the\n",
      "opportunity to ask permission that father Fray Alonso might establish\n",
      "convents and churches in the kingdom. The king was pleased to grant\n",
      "it, insisting only that the sanction of a great bonze, named Gaco,\n",
      "should first be secured; he was a native of Fixen, and was the most\n",
      "highly regarded man in Japan because of his learning. The king sent\n",
      "his own secretary to go before the bonze, to tell him of the poverty,\n",
      "the penitence, the contempt for the things of this world, the modesty,\n",
      "the humility, and the courteous behavior of the father. The bonze,\n",
      "seeing that it was the pleasure of the king, said that such a man might\n",
      "very well receive this permission. In conformity with it three poor\n",
      "churches and houses were built--one in Famamachi under the patronage\n",
      "of our Lady of the Rosary; the second in the city of Caxima [i.e.,\n",
      "Kashima]. named for St. Vincent; and, after some time, another one\n",
      "at the king's court [i.e., Saga], for which at that time permission\n",
      "had been refused. Father Fray Alonso and his companion, when he had\n",
      "one, got the little they needed for their support from Portuguese\n",
      "and Castilians in Nangasaqui, that they might avoid asking for alms\n",
      "from the Japanese, and might thus give no opportunity for the bonzes\n",
      "to complain against them, and to find a pretext for sending them out\n",

      "native of Billoria in Campos, and a son of the convent of San Pablo\n",
      "at Valladolid. He was a man of ability and of good will. When nearly\n",
      "all the lecturers in theology from that convent, together with the\n",
      "lecturers in arts, and many of their most able and learned disciples,\n",
      "determined to go to the Philippinas, father Fray Domingo joined his\n",
      "masters. He suffered his life long from headache. Being sent to Bataan\n",
      "in company with three other fathers, he, as the youngest, had to carry\n",
      "a very heavy burden of duties. He was fortunate enough not to suffer\n",
      "from any further diseases, the Lord being pleased not to add any to\n",
      "his constant headache. His mortification, fasting, and discipline were\n",
      "very great. He wrote some devout tracts in the language of the Indians,\n",
      "and some others in that of the Chinese. He had printed for the Chinese\n",
      "in their language and characters an essay upon the Christian life,\n",
      "with other brief tracts of prayer and meditation, in preparation for\n",
      "the holy sacraments of confession and the sacred communion. He wrote\n",
      "a practically new grammar of the Chinese language, a vocabulary, a\n",
      "manual of confession, and many sermons, in order that those who had\n",
      "to learn this language might find it less difficult. He was prior\n",
      "of Manila; and in the third year of his priorate the news arrived\n",
      "of the death of father Fray Pedro de San Vicente, who was going to\n",
      "Espana as definitor in the chapter general and as procurator for\n",
      "this province. Since it was necessary to send another in his place,\n",

      "\n",

      "In the year 1605 the missionaries to Pangasinan, not contented with the\n",
      "fruitful results of their labors in the level region of that province,\n",
      "took under their charge the village of Manavag, situated among the\n",
      "mountains at a considerable distance from the other villages. The\n",
      "first entry into this village was made by the religious of our father\n",
      "St. Augustine in the year 1600; they built there a church named after\n",
      "St. Monica, and baptized some children. The village was so small,\n",
      "however, that it was not possible for a religious to find enough to\n",
      "do there to justify his continued residence; and accordingly it was\n",
      "visited from Lingayen, the capital of that province, which was at\n",
      "that time in their hands. It caused them a great deal of labor, since\n",
      "they were obliged to travel three days if they went there by water,\n",
      "and two if they went by land; and therefore it was seldom visited, and\n",
      "little good resulted to the village. Inasmuch as the whole population\n",
      "were heathen, they required much persuasion to lead them to baptism,\n",
      "and a great deal of attention to their religious instruction. On this\n",
      "account, those fathers placed a juridical renunciation of the said\n",
      "village in the hands of the bishop, Don Fray Diego de Soria. The\n",
      "bishop, being a religious of our order, asked his brethren to take\n",
      "charge of this village, since there were in it many baptized children,\n",
      "and no other body of religious could care for and guide them. The\n",
      "bishop, in asking the religious to take this matter in charge, was\n",
      "laying upon them no small burden; yet the need was almost extreme,\n",
      "and the great labor brought with it great reward--for, as the\n",
      "apostle says, each man shall be rewarded at the last judgment in\n",
      "proportion to his labors. Hence they determined to assume the charge,\n",
      "and the superior sent there father Fray Juan de San Jacintho, [50]\n",
      "a devoted religious and an indefatigable laborer in the teaching\n",
      "of the Indians. He went to Manavag in the year mentioned, and the\n",
      "fact was spread abroad among the neighboring villages. On account\n",
      "of the great love which they had for the order, and especially for\n",
      "the religious who was there (for he was like an angel from heaven),\n",
      "some other hamlets were added to that one, and the village of Manavag\n",
      "was made of reasonable size. The Negrillos and Zambales who go about\n",
      "through those mountains were continually harassing this village, partly\n",
      "because of their evil desires to kill men, and partly for robbery. They\n",
      "often came down upon it with bows and arrows, and with fire to burn\n",
      "the houses and the church which was practically all of straw. They\n",
      "committed murders, and robbed women and children. Those in the village\n",
      "being thus terrorized, and the men being unable to prevent the evil,\n",
      "since their enemies came when they had gone out into the fields,\n",
      "it was determined to take as patroness the Virgin of the Rosary,\n",
      "that she might aid them in this need. They accordingly dedicated a\n",
      "new church to her, and solemnized the dedication with many baptisms of\n",
      "adult persons. Within a few months, there was not a heathen within the\n",
      "village--a clear proof that the presence of heathen in the country is\n",
      "due solely to a lack of missionaries. Wherever the missionaries are,\n",
      "all are immediately baptized; and not only those of that village which\n",
      "has the missionaries, but some of their neighbors also, participate\n",
      "in the teaching of the religious, and in the favors of our Lady of the\n",
      "Rosary. This is plain from a miracle which occurred a few years after,\n",
      "and was verified before the vicar-general of this country, who at that\n",
      "time was father Fray Pedro de Madalena. It happened thus. Four leguas\n",
      "from Manavag, in a village of Ygolote Indians who inhabit some high\n",
      "mountain ridges, there lived an Indian chief, a heathen, by the name\n",
      "of Dogarat, who used sometimes to go down to the village of Manavag,\n",
      "and to listen out of curiosity to the preaching of the religious. Since\n",
      "the matters of our faith are truly divine, the Indian began to incline\n",
      "toward them, and even toward becoming a Christian. He therefore learned\n",
      "the prayers, and knew them by heart; and the only thing which held\n",
      "him back was the necessity of leaving his vassals and his kinsmen if\n",
      "he was baptized, and going away from the washings in a river of his\n",
      "village, where they used to gather grains of gold, which come down with\n",
      "the water from those hills and ridges where they are formed. God our\n",
      "Lord, to draw him to the precious waters of baptism, brought upon him\n",
      "a severe illness. When he felt the misery of this disease, he sent to\n",
      "call the religious who was at that time in Manavag, father Fray Thomas\n",
      "Gutierrez, who came to his village, called Ambayaban, and visited the\n",
      "sick Indian, giving him thorough instruction in the matters of our\n",
      "holy faith. When he was thoroughly prepared he baptized him and named\n",
      "him Domingo. By the aid of the Lord he recovered, and used to attend\n",
      "church on feast days. He asked for a rosary, which the religious gave\n",
      "him with a direction to say the prayers of the rosary every day,\n",
      "that the Sovereign Lady might aid him. He went out hunting once;\n",
      "and in order that the rosary, which he always wore about his neck,\n",
      "might not interfere with him or be broken by catching in a branch,\n",
      "he took it off and hung it on a tree, and with it a little purse in\n",
      "which he was carrying a trifle of gold. It happened soon after that\n",
      "some Indians set fire to the mountain to frighten out the game. The\n",
      "fire kindled the tree where the rosary was hanging, and burnt it all\n",
      "to ashes. Some time afterward Don Domingo came back for his rosary,\n",
      "and discovered the destruction which the fire had wrought, and the tree\n",
      "in ashes. As he was looking among them he found his rosary entire and\n",
      "unhurt, while everything else was burnt up, and the purse and the gold\n",
      "were consumed, though they were close to the rosary, which did not show\n",
      "a sign of fire. The Indian, amazed, went and told his story to father\n",
      "Fray Thomas, who for a memorial of this marvel kept the miraculous\n",
      "rosary among the treasures of the church, giving the Indian another\n",
      "in its place. There it remained, in token of the esteem and respect\n",
      "which our Lady willed that the fire should pay to her holy rosary.\n",

      "St. Luis Beltran, whom he succeeded in the office of master of novices\n",
      "at Valencia. When St. Luis returned from the Indias, the Lord moved\n",

      "persons in the city. He was made definitor in the first provincial\n",

      "no other country to flee to, as he had fled from Espana to the Indias,\n",
      "and thence to the Philippinas, to avoid this elevation. He was given\n",
      "to devout exercises and to prayer, reading often from some devout book,\n",
      "usually from St. John Climachus, and afterward discussing the passage,\n",

      "\n",
      "In the month of August, 1607, at the octave of the Assumption of\n",
      "our Lady, a church was erected in the village of Nalfotan, the chief\n",
      "village among those which are called the villages of Malagueg [i.e.,\n",
      "Malaueg] in Nueva Segovia. This church had the name and was under the\n",
      "patronage of St. Raymond. The Indians of these villages were and are\n",
      "courageous and warlike. Hence before the coming of the faith they\n",
      "were constantly at war among themselves and with their neighbors,\n",
      "being men of fierce mind and lofty courage, and highly prizing their\n",
      "valor, strength and spirit, an inheritance left to them by their\n",
      "ancestors. Thus they and their neighbors of Gatarang and Talapa, with\n",
      "whom they were very closely related, gave the Spaniards a great deal\n",
      "of trouble, and were feared and still are feared by the other Indians\n",
      "of that large province. In the village called Nalfotan the chief and\n",
      "lord at this time was a young man named Pagulayan, to whom our Lord,\n",
      "in addition to high rank, great wealth, and courage, had given a quiet\n",
      "and peaceful disposition. He was a friend of peace and of the public\n",
      "weal--[seeking not only] his own advantage, but that of his people,\n",
      "and striving to secure what he recognized as good; and in him ran side\n",
      "by side the love of peace, and military spirit and courage--in which he\n",
      "was distinguished and eminent, and for which he was therefore feared by\n",
      "his enemies. God our Lord, so far as we can judge, had predestinated\n",
      "him for Himself; and this he showed by the great affection with which\n",
      "he listened to matters dealing with the service of God, even when he\n",
      "was a heathen and was living among barbarians, idolaters and demons,\n",
      "such as were all his vassals. When he heard that the Ytabes Indians,\n",
      "his neighbors, had religious of St. Dominic who taught them a sure and\n",
      "certain road to salvation, and to the gaining of perpetual happiness\n",
      "for the soul in heaven by serving God in peace and quietude, he strove\n",
      "with all his heart to enjoy so great a good. He discussed the matter\n",
      "with his Indians, and with their approval went down many times to the\n",
      "city of the Spaniards to carry out his religious purpose, endeavoring\n",
      "to have the father provincial, Fray Miguel de San Jacintho, give him\n",
      "a religious for his village. The provincial would have rejoiced to\n",
      "give him one; but those whom he had were so busy, and he had already\n",
      "withdrawn so many in response to such requests, that he was unable\n",
      "to satisfy this good desire, except with the hope that a missionary\n",
      "would be provided there as soon as the religious had come whom he was\n",
      "expecting from Espana. The good Pagulayan, although he was somewhat\n",
      "consoled, did not cease to complain, with feeling, that he had been\n",
      "unable to bring to his village the good which he desired for it. As he\n",
      "was unable to obtain a religious, he took with him a Christian child\n",
      "from among those who were being taught the Christian doctrine in the\n",
      "church, that the boy might instruct him until a father should come who\n",
      "could complete and perfect his teaching. Nay, more: he and his people,\n",
      "having confidence in the promise which had been given them, erected\n",
      "a church in their village that they might influence the religious\n",
      "[to go there], and have that stronger reason for supplying a minister\n",
      "to them rather than to other villages which had no church. All this\n",
      "greatly affected the religious; and finally, in August of this year\n",
      "[1607], father Fray Pedro de Sancto Thomas [51] went there and found\n",
      "the church already built, and the whole village--men, women, and\n",
      "children--gathered on purpose to receive him, as they did with great\n",
      "joy and the exhibition of much content. This caused like content in the\n",
      "soul of father Fray Pedro, who giving many thanks to the Lord, whose\n",
      "work this was, firmly resolved to labor with all his strength in this\n",
      "vineyard which seemed to bear fruit before it was cultivated. Father\n",
      "Fray Pedro was very well suited to begin a conversion like this;\n",
      "for he was so simple and affable that the most remote barbarians,\n",
      "if they talked with him, were compelled to love him. He was of a very\n",
      "gentle nature, and extremely open-hearted, being entirely free from\n",
      "any duplicity or deceit, and acting in all things with the bowels of\n",
      "charity. This is the greatest snare to catch love which may be set\n",
      "for men. Hence they received him as if he came from heaven, and at\n",
      "the beginning they listened to him and obeyed him with great zeal. The\n",
      "devil at these things suffered from rage and the worst pains of hell,\n",
      "as he saw himself losing, all at once, villages which had been his for\n",
      "so many ages. Hence by the means of a sorceress, a priestess of his,\n",
      "named Caquenga, he began to disturb the Indians, to whom this wicked\n",
      "woman said such things that many determined to follow the rites of\n",
      "their ancestors and not to receive the teaching of the divine law. So\n",
      "devilish was this cursed anitera that she kept stirring up some of them\n",
      "against the religious, while at the same time with those who wished\n",
      "to keep him she pretended to be on their side; thus she deceived\n",
      "them all, especially those who were influenced by their zeal for\n",
      "ancient superstitions. Hence they themselves killed their fowls and\n",
      "the swine which they had bred, tore down their houses, and cut down\n",
      "their palm-groves, in which their principal wealth consisted; and,\n",
      "crying out, \"Liberty!\" they fled to the mountains. Here they joined\n",
      "those who had hitherto been their enemies, that they might be more\n",
      "in number and might bring a greater multitude of weapons against a\n",
      "solitary friar who went unarmed, and whom they had invited to their\n",
      "village with such urgency, and received with such joy; and against\n",
      "whom they had no complaint except simply that he preached to them\n",
      "the law of God and the gospel of peace, at their own invitation, and\n",
      "that a most earnest invitation. Pagulayan, with some of his vassals,\n",
      "was constantly at the side of Fray Pedro--who, being secure in his\n",
      "own conscience, was not intimidated, but strove to bring back those\n",
      "who had revolted. Seeking for means of speaking to them, he determined\n",
      "to send an Indian who should arrange in his behalf for a conference;\n",
      "and who should promise the chief of the revolted ones, whose name was\n",
      "Furaganan, that the Spaniards who were in the city of Nueva Segovia\n",
      "would not punish him for what he had done. That the Indian might feel\n",
      "safe and might believe him, he gave the man a relic of St. Thomas to\n",
      "carry; for among them there was no one who knew how to read or write,\n",
      "because they had no letters of their own, so that he was unable to\n",
      "give him a letter, or any other token better known as coming from\n",
      "the father. This, however, sufficed to cause Furaganan to listen to\n",
      "the messenger without ill-treating him; and he agreed to meet the\n",
      "religious at a certain place and on an appointed day. As a token of\n",
      "fidelity and peace, Furaganan sent his bararao--a dagger with which\n",
      "they stab close at hand, and can easily cut off a head--that it might\n",
      "be put in the hands of the religious. They met on the assigned day;\n",
      "and the Indian, annoyed with Caquenga, who had caused the disturbance\n",
      "among them, immediately joined the party of the religious against whom\n",
      "she had caused them to rebel. Furaganan asked them to give him this\n",
      "Indian anitera as a slave, alleging that she had been a slave of his\n",
      "mother, and that in this way and no other could quiet be restored,\n",
      "because he could not suffer that this intriguing slave-woman should,\n",
      "merely through her crafty acts, be more esteemed by the Spaniards\n",
      "than were the chiefs. She was, he said, full of duplicity, having\n",
      "remained with Pagulayan that she might be able to say afterward to\n",
      "the Spaniards that she was not at fault for the uprising--although,\n",
      "in point of fact, she had been the cause of it. Fray Pedro promised\n",
      "to look after this business with great diligence, and to do what\n",
      "should be best. The Indian departed, apparently in peace; but the\n",
      "others did not continue in that frame of mind. At midnight, while\n",
      "the religious was reciting the matins, on the first Sunday of Advent,\n",
      "and when he had come to the first response, the insurgents set fire\n",
      "to the church, thus alarming those who had remained in the village,\n",
      "and causing them to take flight. Pagulayan came to father Fray Pedro,\n",
      "and, acting as his guide, put him on a safe road, carrying him at\n",
      "times on his shoulders across creeks and rivers on the road which they\n",
      "followed. At dawn they halted in a thicket, whence the father went\n",
      "to a little village farther down, because the place where they were\n",
      "was not safe. Here Pagulayan carried the robes from the sacristy,\n",
      "and father Fray Pedro put them as well as he could into a chest,\n",
      "being obliged to leave out a canvas of our Lady, which on account of\n",
      "its size the chest would not hold. Leaving it there, he went on to\n",
      "the village of Pia, where there was a religious with many Christians,\n",
      "and where the people were peaceful. The insurgents went straight down\n",
      "to the village where the chest and the picture were; and, opening the\n",
      "chest, they took out the ornaments, the chalice, and all the rest,\n",
      "and profaned everything. They cut the ornaments of the mass into\n",
      "pieces, to make head-cloths and ribbons. They tore the leaves out of\n",
      "the missal, and drank out of the chalice, like a godless race governed\n",
      "by the devil. Taking the image painted on the canvas, they set it up\n",
      "as a target for their lances. One of them blasphemously said: \"This,\n",
      "the fathers tell us, is the mother of God; if this were truth, our\n",
      "lances would draw blood, and since she sheds none, it is all trickery\n",
      "and deceit.\" The savage said this when he was throwing his lance at\n",
      "the image, and his audacity did not remain without its punishment, for\n",
      "he was soon after condemned to the galleys; and here, in addition to\n",
      "the ordinary hardships suffered in them, he was maltreated by all the\n",
      "other galley slaves when they learned that his crime had been committed\n",
      "against our Lady. They struck him, buffeted him, kicked him, and abused\n",
      "him with words as an enemy of the Virgin; and in this state he died,\n",
      "passing from the wretched life of the galleys to eternal death in hell.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this same year the Indians of Zimbuey, in the level part of La\n",
      "Yrraya in the same province, rose and murdered their encomendero\n",
      "Luis Henriquez, angered because he had treated them during the\n",
      "previous year with more rigor than was proper. There was no religious\n",
      "here. The Indians, in fear of like severity during the present year,\n",
      "had mutinied against the encomendero and thrust him through with a\n",
      "lance. Out of his shin-bones they made steps to go up to the house\n",
      "of their chief--a piece of savagery such as might be expected from\n",
      "enraged Indians. Information of these two risings was sent to the\n",
      "governor of Manila, who sent out the sargento-mayor Christobal de\n",
      "Azcueta with a sufficient number of soldiers. He ascertained the\n",
      "facts in both cases and brought out the truth clearly--namely,\n",
      "that the excesses of the dead encomendero had caused the Indians\n",
      "of his encomienda at Zimbuey to rise, and that the intrigues of\n",
      "Caquenga had roused the Indians of Malagueg. The latter, conscious\n",
      "of their fault, came to the city of Nueva Segovia to beg that the\n",
      "religious might return to them; and father Fray Pedro de Sancto\n",
      "Thomas returned with them. He had greater confidence in the many\n",
      "hopes which he had, for many of them, that they would be good and\n",
      "faithful Christians, than resentment for the wrongs which he had\n",
      "received from others. All this disturbance came to an end, and he\n",
      "built convents and churches and baptized many. In course of time all\n",
      "those people were baptized. Pagulayan was named Luis, and one of his\n",
      "sisters was named Luysa Balinan. They were always very brotherly and\n",
      "sisterly in all things, especially in following virtue. They remained\n",
      "very firm in the faith, and have aided much to bring their Indians\n",
      "to embrace it. They lived according to the teachings of the faith,\n",
      "giving a noble example in this respect, and obviously surpassing all\n",
      "those of their land in everything that has to do with virtue and the\n",
      "service of God. They were, during all their lives, the support of the\n",
      "mission, the comfort of the religious, and generous honorers of their\n",
      "church--upon the adornment of which they spent freely in proportion to\n",
      "their means, giving silver lamps and other very rich ornaments for the\n",
      "service and beautifying of the church. Nor did they forget the poor,\n",
      "not only of their own village, but of the others, who very often come\n",
      "to this one to find food, since this is generally the village where\n",
      "food is most abundant. Don Luis Pagulayan died while young, in the\n",
      "year 1620. His death was much regretted and deplored, as it still is\n",
      "both by the religious and by his Indians, and much more by his sister,\n",
      "Dona Luysa Balinan. She is yet living, and perseveres in holy customs\n",
      "and in laudable acts of all the virtues; for she wears hair shirts\n",
      "underneath her dress as a married chieftainess, is constantly in the\n",
      "church, and is very frequent in her confessions and communions. She\n",
      "is very careful that not only those of her household (who are many)\n",
      "but all of the village--which is one of the largest in the province\n",
      "of Nueva Segovia--should carefully observe the law of God and hear and\n",
      "learn the Catholic doctrine. This she herself ordinarily teaches, and\n",
      "teaches well, for she has had much practice in this office, so that\n",
      "she greatly aids the ministers. A few years ago, there was in this\n",
      "province a great famine; and Dona Luisa having very fertile land,\n",
      "from which she might have made a great profit, preferred to offer\n",
      "it to Christ through His poor. Hence she spent it all upon them,\n",
      "directing all the poor to come every day to her for their food, as\n",
      "was done. In any tumult or disturbance that may arise, she is one\n",
      "from whom the religious learn with perfect certainty the truth of\n",
      "what has happened; and by her assistance (for she is very prudent)\n",
      "the remedy is obtained. The Lord watches over her and prospers her\n",
      "in all things--not only spiritual, in which she surpasses, but also\n",
      "temporal, for she is one of the richest persons that there are in this\n",
      "province. When some superstitious performances were carried on here\n",
      "by some of the chiefs, she immediately informed the religious. When\n",
      "he asked her if she dared to declare the matter before the guilty\n",
      "persons, that in this way the evil might be demonstrated and cured,\n",
      "she replied that she would venture, even though they should give her\n",
      "poison; for they were unable to avenge themselves in any other way,\n",
      "and she had reason to expect them to do this. Such is the spirit\n",
      "and courage with which she serves the Lord and strives for the good\n",
      "of her fellow-men; and so little does she esteem life when there is\n",
      "an opportunity for her to venture it for such a noble end. In the\n",
      "year 1626, the names of those entered in the records of baptism in\n",
      "this church of Nalfotan were counted. The total was found to be four\n",
      "thousand six hundred and seventy, in addition to those baptized in\n",
      "sickness, who were many; and all this rich harvest was reaped in a\n",
      "village which eighteen years ago was composed wholly of heathen.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of this year, 1607, another church was built in December,\n",
      "on Innocents' day, in a village of the same province named Yguig,\n",
      "two days' journey up the river from the city of the Spaniards. The\n",
      "encomendero had collected his tribute from these Indians with great\n",
      "care; but he had given no attention to providing them with Christian\n",
      "instruction, as God and the king commanded him. The Lord, who overlooks\n",
      "many other grievous sins, was unwilling to let this pass without\n",
      "chastisement; but the punishment which He gave the encomendero was\n",
      "that of a kind father, and was inflicted outside of his clothes--that\n",
      "is to say, it fell only upon his wealth, which, when it is guiltily\n",
      "acquired, shall not profit. This encomendero lost all; and when these\n",
      "misfortunes came upon him, one after the other, he perceived that they\n",
      "did not come by chance, and saw what it was with which the Lord might\n",
      "be angry. This was his supporting idolatry and the service of the devil\n",
      "in this village, by his mere failure to provide Christian instruction\n",
      "in it, as was his duty. He repented of what he had hitherto done,\n",
      "and vowed to provide in this village the teaching of the true God,\n",
      "and a religious to preach and teach it. In this year he asked for the\n",
      "religious from the father provincial, Fray Miguel de San Jacintho,\n",
      "and one was given him. Since there was a discussion as to what patron\n",
      "this new church should be given, many slips with the names of saints\n",
      "upon them were placed in a vessel. Three times the name of Sanctiago,\n",
      "patron of the Espanas, came out; and hence the church was given this\n",
      "name, which has been retained in this village of Yguig. This has been\n",
      "done in spite of the fact that, on account of great inundations and\n",
      "floods of the river, it has been necessary to build the church on\n",
      "four separate sites--the first three having been overflowed, although\n",
      "it did not appear possible that the river should reach land situated\n",
      "so high. This river, however, is very large; and its floods are so\n",
      "extreme that they overflowed these eminences, until the church was\n",
      "finally placed where it now is, which is upon a very high hill. Here it\n",
      "enjoys without disturbance the fresh breezes, and is safe against any\n",
      "flood. Among all these changes and difficulties, this tribe would have\n",
      "been scattered and their village destroyed, if the religious had not\n",
      "sustained them with alms and charities. They received much assistance\n",
      "from the Indian chiefs, in particular from one who far surpassed the\n",
      "others in Christian zeal and in fidelity to God, the church, and the\n",
      "Spaniards. The Lord has wrought him great and apparent benefits for\n",
      "this. One was as follows. He went for many days under a temptation\n",
      "of the devil to kill another Indian chief, who had wrought him a\n",
      "great wrong; and could not rest by day or by night for thinking how\n",
      "he might obtain satisfaction against the guilty man. Now he thought\n",
      "of these plans, now of those, and was in such disquiet that he could\n",
      "not conceal the matter. The religious came to a knowledge of this,\n",
      "called him aside, and rebuked him earnestly, for his guilt and the\n",
      "great sin which he was designing, which was entirely contrary to the\n",
      "laws which should govern a Christian, such as he was, who is bound\n",
      "to love his enemies. It was even contrary to the principles of his\n",
      "rank and his chieftainship for him to desire to commit a murder. Don\n",
      "Ambrosio Luppo (as this Indian was named) responded, weeping freely:\n",
      "\"Would to God, father, that you might see my heart, in order that you\n",
      "might understand well how much I suffer from the deed of this man,\n",
      "and might also see plainly how great an impression your teachings have\n",
      "made upon me. If I had not looked to God for some way of following\n",
      "your teachings, would this man have had his head on his shoulders\n",
      "so long? But I pardoned him because God pardoned me; and from that\n",
      "time I have been calm, and more devout than before.\" He received\n",
      "another benefit. He and his wife much desired to have children, but,\n",
      "though they had lived for many years together, they had now passed\n",
      "their youth, and had no children. They communicated their desire to\n",
      "the father, and he advised them what they ought to do, saying: \"When\n",
      "good Spaniards feel these desires, they offer particular devotion to\n",
      "the mother of God and to other great saints\"--naming some who are of\n",
      "most signal assistance in such cases--\"and they go to the churches\n",
      "and offer prayers before their images, that they may intercede with\n",
      "God who can do all things. In this way they many times attain what\n",
      "they desire.\" \"All this will we do very willingly,\" answered husband\n",
      "and wife; \"but what shall we say in our prayer after we have recited\n",
      "the Paternoster and the Ave Maria?\" The religious taught them what\n",
      "they ought to say and what prayers they ought to make to our Lady,\n",
      "briefly indicating to her the desire which they had, and offering\n",
      "to her service the fruit of the blessing which they might attain by\n",
      "their prayers. This they did, going with their petition to the Lady\n",
      "of the Rosary which was in their church. A year later they had a son,\n",
      "to whom the religious, in memory of that which had been agreed upon,\n",
      "gave the name of Juan de Sancta Maria. The parents recognized him as\n",
      "a gift from our Lady. Afterward this same Lady, by means of this same\n",
      "religious, restored the child to complete health in an instant, when it\n",
      "was almost at the point of death. This she did for the comfort of the\n",
      "parents, for it seemed as if they would follow it out of sorrow. On\n",
      "many other occasions she has come to their help; and the Lord has\n",
      "rewarded them with a generous hand for the faith and the good services\n",
      "which, since they became Christians, they have done and are doing.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In April, 1608, the electors, assembled in the convent of Sancto\n",
      "Domingo at Manila, chose as provincial father Fray Baltasar Fort,\n",
      "minister of the holy gospel in the province of Pangasinan. He was by\n",
      "habit and profession a son of the convent of San Estevan at Salamanca,\n",
      "and adopted into that of the Preachers in Valencia, his native land,\n",
      "whence he came to this province in the year 1602. He was at this time\n",
      "prior of the convent. He was of a character such that all necessary\n",
      "qualities for so high an office were united in him; and hence his\n",
      "election was very agreeable to all, both religious and lay, because he\n",
      "was greatly loved and reverenced by all--not only of his own religious\n",
      "order, but also of the others. In this chapter were accepted the\n",
      "houses which had been newly formed in Japon, Pangasinan, and Nueva\n",
      "Segovia, an account of which has been given in the two preceding\n",
      "chapters. What had been at other times ordained and commanded was\n",
      "recalled to mind--namely, that in our conversations we should speak\n",
      "constantly of God, a subject which is never exhausted, is never\n",
      "wearisome to a good man, is edifying to all, and keeps the religious\n",
      "in the fulfilment of the obligations that belong to their estate.\n",
      "\n",
      "[At this time the fathers who were laboring for the good of the natives\n",
      "of Japon had a joyful day in seeing the martyrdom of a person who had\n",
      "been brought to the faith, instructed, and baptized by their ministry;\n",
      "and in whom the faith had struck so deep roots that he yielded fruit\n",
      "an hundred fold, according to the gospel, by suffering martyrdom\n",
      "within four months after becoming a Christian. Having been baptized on\n",
      "July 22, 1608, he was decapitated for his confession of faith on the\n",
      "seventeenth of November in the same year, in the kingdom of Satzuma,\n",
      "his native country. There were laws of the emperor, and also of the\n",
      "actual king of that region, that no soldier or person of rank should\n",
      "be baptized, since it was believed that the strength of these persons\n",
      "would be weakened if they gave up their obligations to those deities\n",
      "from whom victory was expected. In spite of this law, many soldiers and\n",
      "persons of rank were baptized, among them Xichiyemon, a youth of high\n",
      "rank. He received baptism from the hands of father Fray Joseph de San\n",
      "Jacintho, who warned him of the tumult which his baptism would arouse,\n",
      "and of the destruction of his soul which would follow if he were to\n",
      "renounce his baptism. He was so determined and courageous that the\n",
      "father baptized him by the name of Leon. His devotion was such that\n",
      "his conversion could not long be hidden; and, when it was known, the\n",
      "valiant Leon was obliged to resist the supplications of his superior\n",
      "officers, his friends, and his relatives, who represented to him the\n",
      "shame which he would bring upon his family if he should die by the\n",
      "hands of the executioner. This is a thing above measure infamous in\n",
      "Japon, because all malefactors of rank who are condemned to death cut\n",
      "open their own abdomens, and wound their bowels with their own knives\n",
      "[catanas], and thus kill themselves, that they may not die at the\n",
      "hands of another.\" [52] His obligations to his wife and children,\n",
      "and his duties of obedience as a soldier, were insisted upon; but he\n",
      "remained resolved to die as a Christian, not taking his own life, but\n",
      "offering it. He was not imprisoned, and visited his spiritual father,\n",
      "Fray Juan Joseph de San Jacintho, in a little village a quarter of\n",
      "a legua from Firaca. At the appointed time he dressed himself in new\n",
      "white clothes, washed his head, and gird on two swords. He then went\n",
      "to the cross-roads where he was to suffer, and died with a rosary in\n",
      "his hand and a little picture of the descent from the cross on his\n",
      "bosom. His holy body was exhumed by the Christians, and was kept by\n",
      "the fathers of St. Dominic, who afterward, when they were driven from\n",
      "the country, took it with them to Manila and placed it in the chapel\n",
      "of the relics. The tyrant commanded that Leon's wife and eldest son\n",
      "should suffer death, because they had been unable to persuade him to\n",
      "recant. Pablo, Leon's friend, who was accused at the same time, was not\n",
      "so happy as he, but was merely banished from the kingdom of Satzuma.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the eleventh of April in this year (i.e., 1609) there arrived at\n",
      "Manila some religious from the number of those who were brought from\n",
      "Espana to this province by father Fray Gabriel de Quiroga. He died\n",
      "on the voyage before he reached Mexico, and most of the others were\n",
      "scattered, and remained in Nueva Espana. Father Fray Gabriel was a son\n",
      "of our convent at Ocana. He was a great preacher, and had come to this\n",
      "province in 1594. He was in the ministry to the Chinese; being unable\n",
      "to learn the language on account of his advanced age, and being in\n",
      "ill health, he returned to Espana. Here he felt scruples at having\n",
      "left the province of the Philippinas, and asked permission of the\n",
      "most reverend general to return to it with a company of religious. In\n",
      "1607 he gathered a company in Sevilla, but was unable to come for\n",
      "lack of a fleet. Later in the same year, learning that six pataches\n",
      "were being prepared for the voyage, he arranged to reassemble the\n",
      "religious and to take them in these vessels, though he had already been\n",
      "appointed bishop of Caceres. He quickly got together thirty associates,\n",
      "taking the risk of sailing in December. The storms were so furious,\n",
      "and the asthma from which the bishop suffered was so severe, that he\n",
      "departed this life on the way. Of all those who came with him only\n",
      "eight completed the voyage which they had begun.\n",
      "\n",
      "The success of the religious in Satzuma during the six years which\n",
      "they had spent in that kingdom aroused the tono, who was persuaded by\n",
      "the devil and his servants the bonzes to expel the fathers from his\n",
      "country. The case of the holy martyr Leon contributed to influence\n",
      "the tono. It was said in that kingdom that no one ever failed to do\n",
      "what his lords commanded him, and hence such disobedience as that of\n",
      "Leon was regarded as dangerous to the state. The bonzes particularly\n",
      "were bitter against the Christians, who despised the deity whom they\n",
      "worshiped. [53] All the cases of misfortune and all the downfalls which\n",
      "had happened to Christian princes within a few years were referred to\n",
      "their belief, although the misfortunes of the heathen princes had been\n",
      "much more numerous. As the king of Satzuma was at this time actually\n",
      "preparing for a war of conquest against the islands of the Leuquios,\n",
      "[54] he was greatly impressed by these reasonings. He was also\n",
      "disgusted because no vessels had come from Manila to this country,\n",
      "the desire for trade having been his chief object in sending for\n",
      "religious. The king of Satzuma sought for some pretext for expelling\n",
      "the father, without finding any. In the month of August, he sent word\n",
      "to them that the emperor complained because the Spanish religious in\n",
      "his country had never appeared before him. This was only a pretext\n",
      "to get the religious out of the country. There were at that time\n",
      "in all Japan, outside of Nangasaqui, not more than three churches\n",
      "licensed by the emperor: one in Meyaco, of the fathers of the Society;\n",
      "a second in Yendo, of the Franciscan fathers; and a third in Ozaca,\n",
      "of the Society. All the rest were practically in concealment, and\n",
      "had license only from the tonos or kings. The emperor, though he knew\n",
      "this, paid little attention to the matter. The fathers, however, were\n",
      "able to say that father Fray Alonso de Mena had visited the emperor,\n",
      "and had received license from him for the stay in Japan of the rest\n",
      "of the fathers. Still, thinking that they might do well to appear\n",
      "before the emperor, they decided to follow the suggestion of the\n",
      "tono, and father Fray Francisco de Morales went directly to visit\n",
      "him and was kindly received. Before father Fray Francisco returned,\n",
      "the tono gave commands that all the Christians should recant, and\n",
      "exiled those who refused to obey, confiscating their goods. When this\n",
      "happened, there were in Satzuma only the fathers Fray Joseph de San\n",
      "Jacintho and Fray Jacintho Orfanel. Father Fray Joseph went directly\n",
      "to appear before the old tono, and was received with much apparent\n",
      "courtesy, which was a mere cloak for the evil which he was preparing\n",
      "to execute. The father also desired to go to visit the young tono,\n",
      "but was advised that he could do no good; and therefore he went from\n",
      "village to village, strengthening and encouraging the converts. He and\n",
      "father Fray Jacintho, happening to be both at once within the convent,\n",
      "the governor forbade the religious to leave the church, and prohibited\n",
      "the Christians from going to it, hoping thus to prevent the religious\n",
      "from receiving any support. There was only one half-leprous boy,\n",
      "named Juan, who succored them at this time. When he went to buy what\n",
      "they needed, the people paid no attention to his coming and going,\n",
      "because of his being afflicted in this way.]\n",

      "[The kingdom of Japon is subject to constant changes and novelties, as\n",
      "may be known by those who have lived in it, and by those who have read\n",
      "what historians have to say of it. Although the plague of inconstancy\n",
      "is very common among all heathen, the Japanese are particularly subject\n",
      "to it. It is not to be wondered at that the king of Satzuma, after\n",
      "all that he had done to bring religious from St. Dominic to Manila,\n",
      "should have expelled them without any cause. The natural inconstancy\n",
      "of this race is sufficient explanation for his conduct. St. Francis\n",
      "Xavier was expelled from the same kingdom of Satzuma, as he was\n",
      "afterwards from the country of Yamagucu, [55] whence he fled to the\n",
      "kingdom of Firando. As early as the year 1555, the heathen Japanese\n",
      "believed that so soon as the faith should enter their country the\n",
      "kingdom would be destroyed; and in the following year the city of\n",
      "Amaguchi was destroyed, and there was a great persecution. In the\n",
      "year 1564 there was another persecution, even more severe, in Meaco,\n",
      "the imperial court. Father Cosme de Torres was obliged to leave there\n",
      "and to go to the kingdom of Bungo. In Firando the churches were\n",
      "overthrown, and the emperor Nabunanga imprisoned Father Argentino\n",
      "[56] and his associate, refusing to release them until he received,\n",
      "as a ransom, from the most noble and Catholic Don Justo the fortress\n",
      "called Tayca Yama. [57] In 1599 the Taico [i.e., Iyeyasu] banished\n",
      "by public edict all the religious there were in Japon (all of whom\n",
      "were then Jesuits), declaring that all Christians were his enemies;\n",
      "but soon after he granted to father Fray Juan Cobo--a religious of\n",
      "St. Dominic, who had come from Manila as ambassador--that he, and\n",
      "religious of the Society or of any other order, might preach and make\n",
      "converts in Japon. The sons of the seraphic father St. Francis went,\n",
      "under this permission, in 1593, and were kindly received; but very\n",
      "soon afterward commands were given to crucify them, as preachers of the\n",
      "gospel. Father Fray Francisco de Morales felt that conditions were such\n",
      "that it was necessary to comply, and began by taking down the church\n",
      "and looking for boats to carry it in; for it was fitted together with\n",
      "grooves, without nails, and could be, used elsewhere. They removed\n",
      "for a time to Meyaco, and soon afterwards to the city of Ozaca. In the\n",
      "erection of both churches they were bitterly opposed by the members of\n",
      "the other religious orders, although the others could not serve the\n",
      "twentieth or the thirtieth part of the people of those cities. The\n",
      "Japanese banished from Satzuma suffered greatly. Among this people\n",
      "banishment is often worse than death, which is not greatly feared by\n",
      "them. Banishment is generally accompanied with a loss of their goods,\n",
      "so that those who are noble and rich are by it instantly reduced\n",
      "to poverty and drudgery. The fathers carried away their vestments,\n",
      "the timber of the church, and the body of the holy martyr Leon,\n",
      "removing them to Nangasaqui. Father Fray Francisco also carried\n",
      "with him the lepers of the hospital which he had before his house,\n",
      "that they might not be left in the power of wolves. In the meantime,\n",
      "the affairs of Christianity went on prosperously in the kingdom of\n",
      "Fixen. In July, 1609, father Fray Juan de Sancto Thomas, who sent\n",
      "the first religious to Japon when he was provincial, came to Japon\n",
      "as vicar-provincial, bringing with him as his associate brother Fray\n",
      "Antonio de San Vicente. He labored much and successfully in Fixen,\n",
      "and the Lord showed the fathers grace by enabling them to baptize many\n",
      "whom He had predestinated at the point of death. There were especially\n",
      "many cases of baptism of new-born children, whom the parents intended\n",

      "One day's journey up the river from Abulug, in the province of Nueva\n",
      "Segovia, there is a village named Fotol in the midst of a number of\n",
      "other smaller villages, as is customary among the mountains. When\n",
      "these villages were visited for the purpose of collecting tribute,\n",
      "the religious was accustomed to go along that he might be there\n",
      "conveniently to give them some knowledge of the law of God, and strive\n",
      "to bring them to a love of the faith by which they might be saved. This\n",
      "diligence, although it was exercised so seldom--only once a year--was\n",
      "yet not in vain; for the words of the gospel sown in the hearts of\n",
      "these heathen took root and caused them to go down [the river],\n",
      "voluntarily, for the purpose of seeking a preacher to live among\n",
      "them, to teach, direct, and baptize them. Father Fray Miguel de San\n",
      "Jacintho, vicar of Abulug, sent there father Fray Diego Carlos. [58]\n",
      "The Spaniards did not dare to visit the village when they collected\n",
      "the tribute, except in numbers and with arms. On this account,\n",
      "and because they were surrounded by mountaineers who were heathen,\n",
      "untamed, and ferocious, it seemed to the Christian Indians of Abulug\n",
      "that the religious ought not to go without a guard to protect his life;\n",
      "but since the order given by our Lord Jesus Christ is not such, but\n",
      "directs that His preachers should go as sheep among wolves, father\n",
      "Fray Diego would not receive the advice given him by these Indians,\n",
      "though they were friendly; and departed alone with his associate,\n",
      "as a preacher of peace and of the law of love. All the Indians,\n",
      "great and small, came out to receive them with great joy; and the\n",
      "religious immediately began to preach to them and to teach them. In\n",
      "a short time they did a great work, and baptized not only those of\n",
      "this village, but also those who dwelt near there. They left their\n",
      "old sites and, gathering in this one, formed a new settlement. The\n",
      "church was built under the patronage of our Lady of the Rosary,\n",
      "and here the Christian faith went on flourishing until the devil,\n",
      "hating so much good, disturbed them and caused them to fall away for a\n",
      "time--to their great harm, spiritual and temporal; though afterward,\n",
      "recognizing their error, they returned to their obedience to their\n",
      "Creator, as will be told hereafter. Almost in the same manner, and\n",
      "following the same course, another church was built at this time in\n",
      "the high region at the head of the great river, six days' journey\n",
      "from the city of the Spaniards, in a village named Batavag. Here\n",
      "father Fray Luis Flores, who was afterward a holy martyr in Japon,\n",
      "gathered together seven little hamlets, making one very peaceful\n",
      "one. He preached to them, taught them, and baptized many, without\n",
      "receiving any other assistance in all this than that which the Lord\n",
      "promises those who, for love of Him and from zeal for souls, go alone,\n",
      "disarmed, and in gentleness among heathen. To such no evil can happen,\n",
      "since, if the heathen hear the teaching and are converted, all is\n",
      "happiness and joy both in heaven and for the preachers, since the\n",
      "sinners are converted; while if they refuse to admit them, or if,\n",
      "when the preachers are admitted, the heathen do not become converts,\n",
      "the preachers have a certain reward, as the Lord has promised. This\n",
      "reward will be much greater if the heathen, in addition to refusing\n",
      "to be converted, treat them ill, or take their lives from them, for\n",
      "the sake of the Lord whom they preach. Therefore in this as in all the\n",
      "other conversions the religious have always gone alone, unarmed, and\n",
      "in poverty, but sure that they are to suffer no evil. The results in\n",
      "Batavag were very good, although they did not last many years because,\n",
      "desirous of a greater laxity of life than the divine law permits,\n",
      "the natives went up into the neighboring mountain, apostatizing from\n",
      "the faith which many of them had professed in baptism.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the mountains of Ytui, which are not far from Pangasinan, father\n",
      "Fray Juan de San Jacintho went on a journey at this time, accompanied\n",
      "by only two Indians. Here he taught, settled their disputes, and\n",
      "brought them to the faith. These people were a race of mountaineers,\n",
      "among whom other religious had not been safe even with an escort of\n",
      "many soldiers; but the gentle manners of father Fray Juan caused them\n",
      "to become calm, and many of them came sometimes to Pangasinan to ask\n",
      "that religious might be given to them. Many years passed before it was\n",
      "possible to provide them with religious; but the father provincial had,\n",
      "as minister of Pangasinan, seen their pious desires and wished to give\n",
      "them the religious. For this he requested the sanction of the ordinary,\n",
      "and asked the governor for the royal patronage. When the fathers of\n",
      "St. Francis learned this, they came and said that this conversion\n",
      "belonged to them, because it was very near to the ministry and the\n",
      "convent which they had in Baler. The order (which needed religious\n",
      "in other regions) instantly yielded without any dispute, permitting\n",
      "the fathers of St. Francis to take charge of these Indians. This they\n",
      "did, but very soon abandoned them, since the region was not one to be\n",
      "coveted, but was very unhealthy. As a result these Indians remained\n",
      "for some time deprived of the ministry of the holy gospel; and,\n",
      "what caused greater regret, they were morally certain to apostatize,\n",
      "like many other Christians among heathens, since they were children\n",
      "among idolatrous parents and kinsmen, without religious and without\n",
      "instruction.\n",
      "\n",
      "[In this year, 1609, father Fray Juan de Anaya departed this life. He\n",
      "was a native of San Pedro de las Duenas, two leguas from Segovia,\n",
      "and was a professed son of the convent at Valladolid, whence he came\n",
      "to this province in 1598. He was sent immediately to Nueva Segovia,\n",
      "the conversion of which had just begun. He learned the language very\n",
      "quickly, and so wrought with them that he not only taught them the\n",
      "gospel and the Christian life, but also civilization. He showed them\n",
      "how to build their houses, and how to work their fields; and taught\n",
      "them all other matters of human life, not only by instruction, but\n",
      "by example. He sought out the Indians, and brought them down from the\n",
      "mountains and the hiding-places where some, deluded by their sins, had\n",
      "gone to hide from grace. Father Fray Juan was not content to ask where\n",
      "they were and to send for them; but, trusting in his natural strength,\n",
      "he went to look for them and brought them down from the mountains,\n",
      "traveling through the rough and thorny places among the thickets\n",
      "where they hid. He compelled them to enter upon the path of their\n",
      "welfare, not by the violence of a tyrant, but by the force of love and\n",
      "charity. When he was vicar of Pilitan, some of the poor Indians lost\n",
      "all their harvest from an overflow of the river. Not daring to wait\n",
      "for those who were to come and get the tribute, and indeed through\n",
      "fear of starvation, they left the village, and many of them fled to\n",
      "the mountains. Father Fray Juan was deeply afflicted because of the\n",
      "danger which their souls ran. This grief and his many labors affected\n",
      "his health, and finally brought on a flux, from which he died. Another\n",
      "religious, a subordinate and companion of Father Juan, father Fray\n",
      "Vicente Alfonso, died eight days later. He was a Valencian by birth,\n",
      "and had been a sailor up to his twenty-fourth year. He assumed the\n",
      "habit in the convent of Preachers in Valencia, and set a good and\n",
      "humble example as a religious. He was very charitable, giving away even\n",
      "his clothes to the poor. In the province of Pangasinan, in the month of\n",
      "August, 1609, there departed from the miseries of this life father Fray\n",
      "Francisco Martinez, a native of Zacatecas, and a son of the convent\n",
      "of Mexico. He came to Manila in 1598, and was assigned to Pangasinan,\n",
      "where he learned the language of the natives with great perfection. He\n",
      "was constant in labor and in prayer. To defend the Indians, he did not\n",
      "shrink from suffering or fear the perils of the sea. On one occasion,\n",
      "when he had gone to Manila on this account, he fell into the hands\n",
      "of Japanese pirates on his way back to Pangasinan, and was several\n",
      "times in danger of death, with the pirate's knife at his throat, who\n",
      "intended by such terrors to increase the ransom. Death called him from\n",
      "his labors and sufferings. He rejoiced, and died a most holy death.]\n",
      "\n",
      "In this year the most reverend general of the order, seeing how many\n",
      "great things were wrought by the medium of the divine grace through\n",
      "the religious of this province, and condemning the silence with which\n",
      "they hid and covered them, without giving any account of them even to\n",
      "the general head and superior of the order, issued a mandate to the\n",
      "provincials that they should every year, on pain of incurring mortal\n",
      "sin, give him information of what took place in this province of the\n",
      "Philippinas, Japon, and China in the conversions of the heathen and\n",
      "the extension of the holy Church, the service of the divine Majesty,\n",
      "and the edification of the people of Christ. In addition to this, they\n",
      "were to give an account of the state of our order in each province,\n",
      "declaring how many and what convents it included, how many religious it\n",
      "possessed, and of what virtue, sanctity, learning, and good example\n",
      "they were; telling if any of them, after having done illustrious\n",
      "things, had died gloriously; and recounting all other matters which\n",
      "might be an honor to God, a source of comfort to the religious, and\n",
      "an adornment and decoration of our religious order. Together with\n",
      "this mandate, he wrote with his own hand the following letter, from\n",
      "which may be seen the high esteem in which he held this province. The\n",

      "[Death fell heavily upon our fathers in this year, seizing the best on\n",
      "every side. In Manila it cut short the thread of the life of father\n",
      "Fray Bartolome de Nieva. Father Fray Bartolome was a native of Nieva\n",
      "in Castilla la Vieja. While still a layman, he went to the Indias in\n",
      "the search for wealth. He spent some years in Mexico; and in spite of\n",
      "the great wealth of that country, the luxury of life there, and the\n",
      "agreeable climate, he could not be satisfied or find peace. Hence he\n",
      "determined to change his course of life, that he might find the calm\n",
      "for which he sought. Though he was already a grown man, he became\n",
      "a child in following the duties of a religious order. He assumed\n",
      "the habit in the convent of Sancto Domingo in that illustrious\n",
      "city, and began not only upon the elements of the religious life,\n",
      "but upon those of grammar. He did well in the studies of arts and\n",
      "theology, and by the aid of the Lord he came forth a religious of\n",
      "great spiritual qualities--prayer, penitence, and prudence, both\n",
      "spiritual and temporal. He joined a company of religious who passed\n",
      "through Mexico in the year 1594, on their way to the Philippinas. He\n",
      "was too old to learn the language of the Indians, but he accompanied\n",
      "the brother who taught and baptized the Chinese in the hospital for\n",
      "that people; and thus assisted the other minister, whose duty it was to\n",
      "live in the hospital. When he determined to go to the Philippinas his\n",
      "companions in Mexico strove to prevent him, because he suffered from\n",
      "several infirmities, and the labors in the Philippinas were known to\n",
      "be very severe. The Lord, however, gave signs that He desired him to\n",
      "go. He showed especial devotion to the holy Virgin and was a useful\n",
      "and devoted minister. The Lord gave father Fray Bartolome wonderful\n",
      "powers of spiritual conversation, and of insight into character; and\n",
      "even some powers of prophecy, of which a number of illustrations are\n",
      "given. Through him the Lord healed not a few sick. A letter of his is\n",
      "reported at length, in which he incites a sinner to give up his evil\n",
      "way of life, and shows a knowledge of the man's heart which could only\n",
      "have been given him by God. Other instances of the same sort are cited\n",
      "and an account of the holy death of father Fray Bartolome is given.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time there died brother Fray Pedro Rodriguez, a companion\n",
      "of the first founders of this province. He was most closely associated\n",
      "with those who taught and baptized the Chinese. During his whole life\n",
      "he had sole charge of the temporal affairs of the hospital. Father Fray\n",
      "Pedro was not content with receiving those who came, but had persons\n",
      "to inform him if there were any sick in the orchards or quarries, or\n",
      "other places where the Chinese who live about Manila were gathered for\n",
      "work; and immediately sent to have them brought to the hospital. He\n",
      "often went in person to bring them, and, no matter how offensive or\n",
      "disgusting their diseases, he cared for them with his own hands. He\n",
      "waited upon them at all hours of the day and night, caring for\n",
      "their bodies; and he strove to teach them the things necessary for\n",
      "the salvation of their souls, as soon as their sickness gave him an\n",
      "opportunity. He suffered greatly from asthma; but, in spite of this\n",
      "affliction, he constantly employed the discipline of stripes--not\n",
      "upon his flesh, for he had none, but upon his bones, which were\n",
      "covered with nothing but skin; insomuch that some Spaniards came to\n",
      "look at him, regarding it as a marvel that such a living image of\n",
      "death should be able to stand. His head was like a skull with eyes\n",
      "in it, but so sunken that it seemed almost as if he had none. The\n",
      "truth is that he ate no more than sufficient to sustain him in this\n",
      "condition; yet he was so attentive and careful to provide dainty food\n",
      "for a sick man that the religious were sent there to him during their\n",
      "convalescence. He had no greater pleasure than this and his unexpected\n",
      "success in converting some heathen. The Lord provided him with these\n",
      "pleasures, which served him as food and drink to sustain his life. To\n",
      "the two hours of mental prayer observed in the whole province he added\n",
      "two others daily, continuing them after that which follows matins,\n",
      "and prolonging them till dawn. As soon as daylight appeared he left\n",
      "the work of Mary to go to that of Martha in caring for his sick,\n",
      "giving them breakfast after their own custom--which is followed in\n",
      "all the care that is given them, and in everything done for them. In\n",
      "spite of all these labors he thought so humbly of himself that one\n",
      "day when a religious heard him uttering heavy groans and deep sighs,\n",
      "and asked the cause, being unable to refrain from doing so, Fray Pedro\n",
      "answered that it was because he was so evil that, though he had so many\n",
      "times prayed to the Lord for a trifle of His love and charity, he had\n",
      "not gained it. The superior desired to try him as to his obedience;\n",
      "and seeing that he labored with such delight at the hospital, and\n",
      "took such joy in serving the sick, he determined to find out if there\n",
      "were some self-love hidden in all this. He therefore directed him to\n",
      "leave the hospital, and to come to the city and take up the office of\n",
      "sacristan in the convent. Fray Pedro immediately obeyed, and, going\n",
      "into the sacristy which was entrusted to him, he fulfilled his duty\n",
      "with cleanliness, neatness, and good grace in all things, just as if\n",
      "he had exercised it all his life, and had never been occupied with\n",
      "the other. He was accordingly directed to return to the hospital,\n",
      "where he was more needed. The governor, Don Juan de Silva, went to\n",
      "visit the hospital; and when he saw this brother with nothing but\n",
      "bones and skin, and when he heard the things which they said of him,\n",
      "he felt such reverence for him that he kissed his hand, and offered him\n",
      "his favor for all things of which his hospital had need, and arranged\n",
      "to grant him all that he wished, for the governor looked upon him\n",
      "and venerated him as a saint. At the time of his death, about three\n",
      "thousand who had died in the hospital had received baptism. In the\n",

      "[The events which happened in the case of this father are such as God\n",
      "rarely manifests, even in the case of those who are nearest to Him;\n",
      "and I should not dare to bring them to the light if they were not\n",
      "attested by three notable circumstances. The first is that he never\n",
      "formed his own judgment about what happened, but submitted the matter\n",
      "to a learned and spiritual man. The second is, that father Fray Luis\n",
      "kept such silence about these things that he only revealed them under\n",
      "the solemn mandate of his superior. The third is the innocence of his\n",
      "life, and his marvelous virtue. A formal certificate as to these three\n",
      "circumstances is given at length; it is by Fray Juan de Sancto Thomas,\n",
      "and is dated at Manila, August 10, 1615. Father Fray Luis Gandullo\n",
      "was a native of the town of Aracena in the archbishopric of Sevilla,\n",
      "and was born of a rich and noble family. At the age of fourteen he\n",
      "made a vow to assume the habit of the Dominican order. This vow he\n",
      "was unable to carry out for eight years, because of his duties to\n",
      "his widowed mother and his two sisters. While still a youth, he was\n",
      "favored with a vision of the Virgin, which was followed soon after\n",
      "by a vision in which the devil appeared to him. After his two sisters\n",
      "were settled in life a certain trouble befell him in his own country,\n",
      "which obliged him to leave it and to go to the Indias. He dwelt for\n",
      "some time in Nueva Espana, where he lived with some freedom, the Lord\n",
      "preparing to drive him, by the very thorns which he should find in this\n",
      "road, to the religious life. His ancient desires to become a friar of\n",
      "St. Dominic returned to his mind, and he began to arrange with the\n",
      "prior of the convent of the city of Puebla to assume the habit. The\n",
      "prior and the friars of the convent, being asked by him if a secret\n",
      "business pledge which he had made had any validity, declared that it\n",
      "had no force in conscience, and would not hold him in a court of law\n",
      "if the party concerned would tell the truth of the case. He assumed\n",
      "the habit and waited for fourteen months to be professed. While he\n",
      "was looking for his profession to take place his creditor entered the\n",
      "convent, declaring that they were taking away his money by permitting\n",
      "the novice to enter the profession, since he could earn what he owed\n",
      "in the secular life. Upon this, the superior commanded Luis to lay\n",
      "aside the habit; but the Lord punished the creditor by burning a\n",
      "great deal more of his property than the debt amounted to. Luis,\n",
      "who knew that the obligation was merely a confidential agreement,\n",
      "refused to pay it because he did not owe it. He was ordained as priest,\n",
      "having determined to become a secular clergyman. Under this condition\n",
      "he prayed God to help him fulfil his vow; and afterward had visions,\n",
      "among them a dreadful one of the devil in the form of a snake. Being\n",
      "constantly attended by visions, he determined to carry out his vow,\n",
      "and one night heard a voice calling to him, \"Luis!\" He answered,\n",
      "\"Lord!\" and the voice went on to say, \"Rise, and go to Mexico to\n",
      "assume the habit.\" It seemed to him that it was the voice of his dead\n",
      "brother. His conduct when he came to the convent was such that the\n",
      "brethren there decided to grant him the habit and the profession\n",
      "together, since he had already completed his novitiate. When the\n",
      "founders of this province went through Puebla, father Fray Luis\n",
      "desired to accompany them, but was unable to carry out his wish at\n",
      "that time. He received intimations from a holy woman, a penitent\n",
      "of his, that the Lord favored his desire to come to this province;\n",
      "and to this intimation were added other supernatural signs. A great\n",
      "scandal having arisen because of violence shown by the viceroy\n",
      "to a superior of a certain religious order, [59] father Fray Luis\n",
      "felt called upon to preach against the viceroy; he was condemned\n",
      "to exile in the Philippinas, and received the sentence with joy. He\n",

      "I recently discovered <PERSON> and enjoy her writing style so when I saw this on Netgalley, I couldn't resist. While this novel had a strong start with many elements that make for a deliciously awesome story, it wasn't executed well and dragged in the middle, ultimately lowering the rating.  <PERSON> writes very simply. Her prose isn't flowery or overly complicated. She writes a great story that is easy to read, which is a rare skill and something I appreciate during those times when I just want to escape into a story and forget about the stress I currently have in my life.  In this novel, Lady <PERSON> is currently retired from London as she struggles to learn how to walk again after a debilitating illness. <PERSON> is an impoverished Irish earl who had traveled to England to find a wife whose dowry can hopefully help him save his land and tenants during the potato famine. He has traveled to Lady <PERSON>'s estate at the invitation of her aunt who has agreed to support him. Lady <PERSON> is not aware of this invitation and when her aunt is gone and <PERSON> arrives with nothing except his pants due to a robbery, she does not believe his identity, but his bearing and compassion sway her to let him stay until his identity can be verified.  Lady <PERSON>'s family has a host of issues: a mother with some kind of mental disorder, a secretly married sister who is desperate for her missing husband to return from India, opinionated servants, <PERSON>'s handicap, and missing rents. Despite all of this, in addition to <PERSON>'s own issues with his mother's hatred, his father's murder, and the famine, the novel doesn't feel overly dark. The struggles have shaped the characters into the compelling people that they are, but many of the issues are a way of life and not something they dwell on and cannot get past. Both characters are survivors and I appreciated that element. It made them real and easy to relate to.  The story opened strong and I enjoyed the pull between the characters. However, after an excellent set-up, the story seemed to stall. There was too much inner angst on <PERSON>'s part and too much repetition of the characters over whether they could be together. It got boring. Then, towards the end, <PERSON> acts completely out of character and rejects <PERSON> at a time when he needed her the most, really causing me to downgrade my positive feelings for her. Everything wrapped up a little too neatly and I just didn't feel as emotionally invested in the story at the end.  Overall, I really liked <PERSON>'s character and appreciated his innate kindness and ability to adapt. I also appreciated <PERSON>'s strength, but felt that as she regained her physical faculties, her emotional capacity diminished, ultimately making me lose respect for her. The story had an excellent set up but lost steam towards the middle and end, lowering the rating. I am definitely going to check out the next books in this series as <PERSON> offered up two interesting heroines in this novel, but I believe that this book would have been better as a long novella with less flip-flopping within the characters' hearts.  I received a complimentary copy through Netgalley to read and review. All opinions are my own. I appreciate the opportunity.\n",

      "It’s an exciting day for Splatoon 2 fans, as a slew of news regarding the game’s forthcoming updates has been uncovered. Dataminers from the Wii Sports community team have dug up information that indicate the sequel title will introduce new maps and weapons, which appear to include both brand-new additions and returning classics, as well as cosmetics, game modes, and more.\n",
      "Reddit user <PERSON> the news on the Splatoon 2 forums, thanking the Wii Sports for conducting the mine and then affirming that they are simply the messenger passing on the data. It should be noted that the information collected contains massive spoilers for Splatoon 2, so those wanting to maintain an untainted gameplay experience should view with caution.\n",
      "The first section of leaked info covers upcoming maps both old and new. In the game’s 1.1.1 update.Incomplete files for two revamped version of the Kelp Dome and Blackbelly Skatepark from the original Splatoon have been introduced. It’s also been discovered that additional maps called “Line” and “Tunnel” are currently in development. Whether these names are simply placeholders until final titles are decided upon remains unclear. Given that proxy images for new maps titled “Kawa” and “Pillar” are also present, it seems likely that “Line” and “Tunnel” are stand-in names for now.\n",
      "Nintendo is also including testing versions of Shifty Station, the online multiplayer stage available exclusively in Splatfests. In Shifty Station, players spawn on opposite ends, standing on raise platforms that slope to sequentially shorter risers that are linked by ramps. A large open area can be seen to the right, and a small passage connects the map together. The datamine reveals that in the most recent ketchup versus mayo Splatfest, the game downloaded the real Shifty Station stage model and the layout file separately, which explains why existing files contain debugging and testing objects.\n",
      "Splatoon 2 developers are conducting trials on new Salmon Run stages, currently operating with the internal names “Shakehouse” and “Threepoints.” As with the Kelp Dome and Blackbelly Skatepark maps, files for Shakehouse and Threepoints are bundled in the 1.1.1 update. What’s different is that these are the last two of the four planned Salmon Run stages as of the 1.0.0 version of Splatoon 2.\n",
      "Off the map news, the datamined information shifts into new Splatoon 2 weapons and reveals that Grizzco-branded weapons were found in the files and appear to be underway. Players can anticipate three additions: a Blaster, which shoots ink out in a firework-like pattern; a Charger, which fires a powerful shot; and a Brella, which is a short-range shotgun that pops out into an umbrella shield.\n",
      "But that’s not what will hype fans up the most. The discovery of a new weapon type is. Dataminers found that a weapon called the Squeezer will kick off a new classification in Splatoon 2. A fellow Redditor by the name of NEFARIOUS_SQUID posted a full description of the Squeezer, as well as information on the supplementary Foil Squeezer:\n",
      "“The Squeezer main is a new type of semi-auto shooter where one trigger pull equals one ink shot! Holding down [ZR] won’t provide a steady stream of ink, but spamming the trigger will give you rapid fire with a damage output you’ll dig! Set up a Splash Wall to protect your team, then head for the front lines! The semi-auto style is a great way to control your ink use. Put even far-off foes on notice with the Sting Ray special! If you’ve got confidence in your aim, give this single-shot set a try! Foil Squeezer: We took a Squeezer, slapped the manufacturer’s logo on it, and the Foil Squeezer was born. BOOM! The main weapon has the action of the original Squeezer, but it now comes with Splat Bombs. So flush ’em out, then take careful aim! Blow up the front lines with the Bubble Blower special, then charge in with your team and take out the opposition! It’s a fairly aggressive set, but the main weapon requires steady aim, making it suited for veteran battlers.”\n",
      "Beyond upcoming maps and weapons, big changes are apparently coming to the game’s Octolings like the fan-favorite Marina. What was previously known as the user’s “gender” in the original Splatoon will be replaced with a parameter called PlayerType. A similar parameter titled ModelType shares the same values and seemingly affects in-game characters. The possible values are SquidGirl, SquidBoy, and Oct. Dataminers found a fourth value named OctBoy in the game’s executable, but models and text for boy Octolings haven’t yet been discovered. In the same vein, it can’t be confirmed at this time whether Octolings will become playable without in-game testing.\n",
      "If all the leaked information is fully accurate, Splatoon 2 enthusiasts have a mountain of incredible updates to get hyped up about. However, as some fans have noted, the development for version 1.0.0 seems a bit rushed, and it appears that Nintendo left a lot behind (namely the unfinished Marooner’s Bay) despite attempting file clean-ups. Hopefully the company can play catch-up before update 1.1.1 — and all this cool content — rolls out.\n",

      "cioè a Marsala. Ma sul più bello gli si rivoltarono le retrovie: liberati momentaneamente dal pericolo punico, i sicelioti ne avevano abbastanza anche di <PERSON>, che dovette tornarsene a Taranto quasi in fuga. Così, nella ennesima oscillazione del pendolo, i cartaginesi finirono nuovamente nei pressi di Siracusa, da cui il neoeletto generale <PERSON> riuscì però a ributtarli. Nel 269 egli fu acclamato re e prese il nome di <PERSON>: l'omonimo predecessore era vissuto due secoli prima e <PERSON> cercava con strani alberi genealogici di dubbia fattura di discenderne per li rami. E già da <PERSON> si chiede a gran voce la guerra contro Cartagine, mentre il grande poeta <PERSON> incita <PERSON> a scacciare dall'isola l'odiato sempiterno nemico, che si è installato perfino a Messina. A questo punto son le cose, quando un terzo interlocutore si fa avanti per dialogare con i due litiganti: <PERSON>.\n",
      " Una guarnigione cartaginese, agli ordini di un tale <PERSON>, presidiava Messina nell'estate del 264 a.C. Un reparto di soldati romani traghettò nella città e il tribuno militare che li comandava intimò ad <PERSON> di sgomberare la piazza, altrimenti lo avrebbe scacciato con la forza. <PERSON>, timoroso di scatenare la violenza dei nuovi venuti – che sapeva di mano pesante – e di innescare una guerra, di cui il suo popolo gli avrebbe fatto <PERSON>, timoroso però altresì di essere accusato di pusillanimità, <PERSON> fra i due rischi scelse il secondo, che credeva minore, e fece luogo al presidio romano. Tornato a Cartagine fu crocifisso, come era sorte dei comandanti che i cartaginesi giudicavano inetti. Nel frattempo però i romani avevano messo piede a Messina e nessuna forza al mondo li avrebbe scacciati per otto secoli.\n",
      " Ma chi erano questi romani? Roma aveva avuto una elaborazione interna più tormentata di quella di Cartagine. Secondo la tradizione, dopo <PERSON> essa era stata dominata per più di due secoli da altri sei re, alcuni dei quali sono considerati figure storiche e non leggenda. I sette avrebbero regnato in media 35 anni ciascuno, e quattro di essi sarebbero periti di morte violenta. All'epoca regia gli storici antichi fanno risalire un gran numero di ordinamenti civili e militari, fra cui la divisione della popolazione in classi di censo e di armamento, con il diritto-dovere di servire la patria: dalla milizia erano infatti esclusi i nullatenenti, e i romani non impiegavano mercenari. L'ultimo periodo regio, il VI secolo, coincide con la constatabile influenza etrusca sulla città di Roma e con il suo ingrandimento urbano, che toccò dimensioni per quell'epoca veramente considerevoli: 427 ettari cinti da otto <PERSON>, con una popolazione cittadina di 50.000 abitanti e una popolazione totale di circa 100.000, viventi su un territorio di 2000 chilometri quadrati, un po' più della superficie dell'attuale comune di Roma.\n",
      " Con la caduta della monarchia, che la tradizione colloca nel 510 a.C., Roma andò incontro a un indebolimento. E tutto il V secolo, oltre che impegnata a combattere contro i minacciosi vicini – equi, ernici, volsci, etruschi –, Roma fu percorsa da fremiti interni, che lentamente equilibrarono le varie stratificazioni\n",

      "hello what's up internet early morning stream again the last holiday before Oh three minutes and grab it together okay um yeah I usually do these early morning streams because early morning is the only time I get to play now or play with any you know where I I'm sure I won't I won't say get bothered but I won't be disturbed by uh either of my kids needing something and then of course you know you should pay attention to your kids which is why I don't use the game when I know there I know what's up Rafael James so I do really try to play a bit early now so that you know you can get maybe 45 minutes of uninterrupted time although I'm I'm kind of mad Onna sorry I thought it was the skirmish but I'm kind of mad at OverWatch to the way the ranking works now is that you need to do it you get to feeling tight rant it every seven wins or 22 losses so I've been I've had two batches of seven wins like didn't went straight but you know I've won 14 games I've I've been ranked twice for two win batches and for the past two win batches my rank hasn't changed I've stuffed research bronze one which is the highest level of bronze so it's not it's not anything to brag about and like every time I get a you know I think okay okay after I get the next batch of wins you know I'm gonna level up now get out of there hold on ah [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] be fair it's always tough too camping out of our base come on guys come on let's do this let's break it up thank you come on come on do this foreign instead okay let's time this properly let's plank them and then and then let's get it okay yeah yeah okay one team kill for another team let's do this guys you need only ask for my help don't do that thanks don't do that thanks for First Take Care oh thank come back come back stop healer and stop damage dealers still bronze one first this is a time again to try again oh yeah I act like I'm bitter about it but to be honest I I can see why I really have a lot of bad habits um to be honest I blame I blame the fact that I I oh crap get out of there I blame the fact that I oh you know when I first started playing FPS decades ago it was just like running oh crap ah idiot it's just kind of like a run and Gun container foreign looks like we need a mercy do this come on yes I'll say that I blamed it on the fact that when I first started playing a wedding when I first started playing FPS it was just like you just have to you just have to say ah you just have to charge in there and you know kind of use your reflexes and weave in and out pero Mexico uh now it's very tactical you know there's a lot of other considerations just blindly charging in because I'm a old dude that's just really how I play FPS oh come on come on come on that's it GG [Music] the usual complaints about being made oh look they're me if that was the last one to die how is FPS gaming on the new monitor very nice very nice the pg48 uq I have no regret it's just like really immersive with the screen all over you know all over my face all over my face man 12 minutes for a game for rank not doing that whereas unranked only as one minute Junior so I'm not super articular um ranked unranked yeah it doesn't take it doesn't change I'm always just um bronze one I win and you go online and everybody's trashing the bronze players like you're only in bronze because you suck which again I I have to admit yes I do have a lot of bad habits painfully trying to unlearn don't charge it and don't be an idiot don't be a hero I know this is OverWatch but don't be a hero but I I said something like um Nepal wire doesn't really do well in this stage or at least when I play Moira oh but somebody got Mercy okay stop Ray zero I'm saying something like there's nothing um uh yeah my OverWatch rank is nothing to get excited about what is uh well I woke up today to very some very exciting news I mean some of our minor long but uh it's really like wow anyway but um apparently our video on our latest video on warranties regarding where we have actual data on failure rates uh came out in Tom's Hardware it was one of the things they had a whole write-up about it about um describing what the videos uh describing what the video is detailing they even um I don't want to say copied but they they had all of our failure rates there like 600 plus for the oh grabbing one already I I funny funny all right see that's problem like I get too fixated on a Target and I'm not there's no game awareness situational awareness because I what I wanted to do morning punish the Winston for taking out our Mercy but but all right okay my healing is basically on par with well our painful our Mercy is not doing so well although I think to be fair that Mark was she get picked a lot the enemy team is very aggressive with their picks foreign thank you Mercy ah nice 99 captured in overtime well at least it won't be a perfect win for these guys you don't flawless to me ah time again to try again we're holding the point OverWatch game still again hey what happened oh we lost MRT yeah ah crap okay that might be it that might be it good fight back from 99 from 990. ah we actually got it up to 94 so they were at 99. and then we got it up to 94. so not bad two one did a loss but um yeah so anyways I woke up today to some very exciting newsparently Tom's Hardware featured Hardware sugar or featured one of Hardware sugars videos um in featured yeah sorry um featured one of our videos that's a recent warranty video where we talk about failure rates and stuff and so they go very in depth on reporting like this is the data that we showed and these are the Brands and stuff like that and so actually and the Tanner the article was like we want more we want more info like on the breakdown in Nvidia cards MD cards oh don't worry I'll be right behind you I like this oh sorry grab it ah crap foreign get back in here oh get up there oh my Mercy never die sorry to be honest I still thought that was Moira and then I still thought that was Mario and I was gonna hold the the direct damage thingy and that was pretty but I'm like why am I crying I don't think we're gonna have a fight back from this one can't feel play of the game I messed up in OverWatch one you could uh endorse opponent which I thought was that you just wanna acknowledge the skill of the other side foreign okay two games two losses but nothing uncompt nothing not an unfamiliar stat when I play OverWatch yes everybody's like if you're in bronze it's your fault you're in bronze don't blame it on your teammates Etc and it's true it's true I uh still have a lot to learn or unlearn rather yeah a lot of bad habits that be doing though that could be nice to get I was actually ranked silver before earlier on when OverWatch 2 was new but I think because of the system was biased against like oh this guy played a lot of OverWatch once he Guru knows what he's doing but I guess that assumption is wrong it was good how are you if we do this right they won't even know what happened no huh five four three yeah so the waking up to the news actually one of our is one of the rocky the programmer who saw it that we were covered in Tom's Hardware I was like wow it's like big on CNN or something is there a hug where's our thing guys I can't okay hi like I got two kills I'm not quite sure what happened there to be honest apparently I caught there uh in a pocket so she was trying to Ambush someone in that corner so I was there for you take all the robot from us it's hard to go up against the whole team um yes I managed to get two kills in that pocket I'm not quite sure special delivery oh that happened if you can thank you charged over there over there okay all right back up no I do not have backup probably around 70. also I think oh my goodness my goodness all right guys let's um foreign artists looks like you're being paid foreign oh crap ah man walked right into that one okay well I was right in the middle of that one Mercy is so slow mainstream connected hey diving into their hands though fairness I hit with that melee though I need healing yeah you do it's okay don't worry I'll rescue you uh no thank you enhancing your strength the healing over here improving your vices foreign fire in the hall stop that pushing tomorrow pew thanks for the Boost ER this is kind of a hash Ina stop score top Hills and top heels enhancing could go back to I'll replay this game and watch it helping you up hey I never say that yeah okay all right so I do have a lunch a brunch date but that's still hmm they're also not try about no okay zero three just four minutes I get one more game in so like in the OverWatch games it's not really like the games you have fun in aren't it doesn't matter if you win or lose but it's like if you have a good team like they're supportive and they're chat and things like that um and maybe it's like one is the three like you get one good team like that versus three where everybody's shouting at you like you're not doing your job and the team is losing because of you and things like that so definitely in the majority young major toxic nah play experience but if you do get like that nice team like somebody says no now um I'm a new player to the game and like legit you can see that they are a new player and everybody's still supportive like the best advice I got was like all right so the best advice I saw someone give us just shoot the enemy team pretty much what boils down to uh yes you don't even mind if you if you lose that one trying to practice Anna my aim is terrible what's up Jason emir whyimir select your Heroes technically I think if you're defending you spawn so if you die you spawn so far away from the the card that a good Mercy really helps the team survival because with the rescue I'm assuming you can get into a place for a good rescue um those pressure seconds I mean it's all about the time for defense like just gotta hold the line bye after another timing know you should focus on training you waste your time playing games attackers incoming foreign oh sniper up making a full recovery right now wait long somebody let me latch onto you crap there we go let's go hi it's regulating well Jordan's old oh foreign ah Jesus you know what's going on anymore steps man I got one blaster killed Moira ah you resurrect someone and you run back to your front line you don't like you two seconds away from the uh Shield of your tank this is why I'm still bronze one I try you know my healing stats are up there mean let's see that why why would I turn my back and then I could use all of my fading after that please I mean you can't close the line by itself I am great do they have a Sombra all right oh if the other Moira that I know I thought

      "Clarke was told by a short Scottish woman with serious anger management issues (In Clarke's defence she really did look short enough to be a student, and she wouldn't have be that rude to her if she had known that she was the house mother) that she was rooming with the two girls, Octavia and Raven. She couldn't decide whether she liked them or not. The room was nice though, for a dorm room. It was big enough and the wooden floorboards were painted white, gauzy curtains hung over the windows and Octavia seemed to be covering every available surface in fairy lights.\n",
      "\"So that is your bed\" Octavia stopped hanging fairy lights around her pin board and pointed to the bed on the far left of the room, underneath the biggest window \"there's a loose floorboard underneath if you've got anything to hide.\"\n",
      "\"Please tell me you're interesting enough to have something to hide new girl\" Raven said looking up from the suitcase that she was unpacking.\n",
      "Clarke raised an eyebrow.\n",
      "\"Something tells me I'm the most interesting person in this place\"\n",
      "\"God I hate rich kids\" Raven scoffed \"you're all so full of yourselves\"\n",
      "\"You go to private school, I don't think you've got a leg to stand on \" Clarke countered\n",
      "\"Me and O are both on full scholarships\"\n",
      "\"Well I hate smart kids so we're even\"\n",
      "There was a silence and then Octavia started to giggle.\n",
      "\"I like you Clarke, I might not be bored to tears being here this year. I think we're gonna be friends\" she managed to say through her laughter\n",
      "\"I'm not good at having girl-friends\"\n",
      "\"That's because you're a bit of a bitch\" said Raven.\n",
      "\"Yeah but so are we\" Octavia smiled.\n",
      "Clarke glared at them both.\n",
      "Octavia and Raven looked at her unimpressed, sadly they didn't seem to be the slightest bit intimidated, only amused.\n",
      "\"Well don't get attached to me, I'm not staying long\"\n",
      "\"How come?\"\n",
      "\"Because Abby likes to send me to a new school every year. The minute she sees me and realises that her daughter is still the spawn of satan, her words not mine, she'll find somewhere else for me to go\"\n",
      "\"Who's Abby?\" Octavia asked\n",
      "\"My mom\"\n",
      "\"You call your mom by her first name, weird.\"\n",
      "Raven coughed.\n",
      "\"Shit sorry, I say things without thinking sometimes\" Octavia looked slightly guilty.\n",
      "\"It's cool, it is weird, but so is my mom\"\n",
      "\"Amen\" Raven smiled at her, possibly for the first time since she'd met her.\n",
      "3. Welcome To Hell\n",
      "**Summary for the Chapter:**\n",

      "> I'm sorry I'm rubbish at updating and only write short chapters, thanks everyone for the lovely comments and encouragement to keep writing (I will no matter how long it takes). Anyway enjoy the chapter\n",
      "\"I'd literally rather set myself on fire than wear that\"\n",
      "\"Well if you die they'll give us passing grades for the rest of the semester, so take one for the team\"\n",
      "Clarke threw a pillow in the general direction of the offending uniform in question.\n",
      "\"Ow\" Octavia yelped, almost dropping the hideous green check skirt and matching green blazer.\n",
      "Clarke regarded the uniform again.\n",
      "\"Nope I'm not doing it\"\n",
      "Octavia gave Raven a look. Clarke had seen less menacing looks on Pitbulls.\n",
      "\"If we have to force you into it ourselves Clarke, we will\"\n",
      "\"Fine\" Clarke narrowed her eyes and snatched the clothing out of Octavia's hands.\n",
      "She went to get changed in the bathroom and did her best to make herself look less like a 1950's English school girl. All things considered, she didn't look too bad. She rolled the skirt up high enough that her new tattoo peaked out from under the hem slightly and left one too many buttons undone on her shirt. She smudged her eyeliner a little and swiped on a coat of lip balm.\n",
      "\"Clarke hurry up\" Raven yelled, banging on the bathroom door.\n",
      "She took one last look, fluffed up her messy blonde hair and opened the door.\n",
      "\"Okay quit yelling at me, let's go\"\n",
      "Octavia and Raven took one look at her and burst out laughing.\n",
      "\"God you are such a stereotype\" Octavia giggled.\n",
      "\"You are never going to get away with that uniform\"\n",
      "\"Can we please just go\" Clarke rolled her eyes.\n",
      "\"Young lady what are you wearing!\" the angry Scottish lady from the day before practically jumped in front of Clarke as she walked into the dining hall for breakfast.\n",
      "\"Um? Clothes\"\n",
      "\"Underwear you mean\" she hissed\n",
      "Clarke rolled her eyes. Again. This school seemed to make her do that a lot.\n",
      "\"I'm wearing the uniform\"\n",
      "\"You're wearing something but that is certainly not the uniform. I'll let you off because it's your first day but if you're not in proper uniform by tomorrow you'll be in big trouble\"\n",
      "Octavia and Raven nodded at the matron and pulled Clarke to a table. It was at the very back of the room and a couple of boys were already crowded round it.\n",
      "The girls still had Clarke's arms in an iron grip and they practically marched her to a seat at the table.\n",
      "\"Well done\" Raven nudged her as she sat down \"you didn't piss off anyone in the 5 feet we had to walk\"\n",
      "A dark haired boy at the end of the table laughed, not looking up from the paperback he was reading.\n",
      "\"Trust me, that's progress\" Clarke smirked, waiting for the boy to look up.\n",
      "She couldn't tell what he looked like with his head down the way it was.\n",
      "\"That's my brother, Bellamy\" Octavia sighed \"Bell, head out of the book and say hi\"\n",
      "Clarke was not a cliche despite Octavia's earlier comment so she did not gasp when the boy looked up from the book. But if there was a face worth gasping over, it was Bellamy's. Freckles covered his face and he looked at her through long dark eyelashes. His brown eyes that had been previously glued to the book looked her up and down.\n",

He began the expedition with his brother Al and three others on a trip up the Yukon River. They commissioned construction of and fitted out a small, shallow-draft sternwheel steamer which they named the New Packet. Schieffelin prospected during the trip in Alaska and found some specks of gold. He was for a while convinced he had found the continental belt he had been searching for. But he was extremely discouraged by the Arctic cold he experienced, up to 50 F below zero (-46 C). He decided that mining in Alaska was a lost cause and he returned to the lower 48 states.\n",

      "{'text': 'It is done, and submitted. You can play “Survival of the Tastiest” on Android, and on the web. Playing on the web works, but you have to simulate multi-touch for table moving and that can be a bit confusing.\\n\\nThere’s a lot I’d like to talk about. I’ll go through every topic, insted of making the typical what went right/wrong list.\\n\\nConcept\\n\\nWorking over the theme was probably one of the hardest tasks I had to face.\\n\\nOriginally, I had an idea of what kind of game I wanted to develop, gameplay wise – something with lots of enemies/actors, simple graphics, maybe set in space, controlled from a top-down view. I was confident I could fit any theme around it.\\n\\nIn the end, the problem with a theme like “Evolution” in a game is that evolution is unassisted. It happens through several seemingly random mutations over time, with the most apt permutation surviving. This genetic car simulator is, in my opinion, a great example of actual evolution of a species facing a challenge. But is it a game?\\n\\nIn a game, you need to control something to reach an objective. That control goes against what evolution is supposed to be like. If you allow the user to pick how to evolve something, it’s not evolution anymore – it’s the equivalent of intelligent design, the fable invented by creationists to combat the very idea of evolution. Being agnostic and a Pastafarian, that’s not something that rubbed me the right way.\\n\\nHence, my biggest dillema when deciding what to create was not with what I wanted to create, but with what I did not. I didn’t want to create an “intelligent design” simulator and wrongly call it evolution.\\n\\nThis is a problem, of course, every other contestant also had to face. And judging by the entries submitted, not many managed to work around it. I’d say the only real solution was through the use of artificial selection, somehow. So far, I haven’t seen any entry using this at its core gameplay.\\n\\nAlas, this is just a fun competition and after a while I decided not to be as strict with the game idea, and allowed myself to pick whatever I thought would work out.\\n\\nMy initial idea was to create something where humanity tried to evolve to a next level but had some kind of foe trying to stop them from doing so. I kind of had this image of human souls flying in space towards a monolith or a space baby (all based in 2001: A Space Odyssey of course) but I couldn’t think of compelling (read: serious) mechanics for that.\\n\\nBorgs were my next inspiration, as their whole hypothesis fit pretty well into the evolution theme. But how to make it work? Are you the borg, or fighting the Borg?\\n\\nThe third and final idea came to me through my girlfriend, who somehow gave me the idea of making something about the evolution of Pasta. The more I thought about it the more it sounded like it would work, so I decided to go with it.\\n\\nConversations with my inspiring co-worker Roushey (who also created the “Mechanical Underdogs” signature logo for my intros) further matured the concept, as it involved into the idea of having individual pieces of pasta flying around and trying to evolve until they became all-powerful. A secondary idea here was that the game would work to explain how the Flying Spaghetti Monster came to exist – by evolving from a normal dinner table.\\n\\nSo the idea evolved more or less into this: you are sitting a table. You have your own plate, with is your “base”. There are 5 other guests at the table, each with their own plate.\\n\\nYour plate can spawn little pieces of pasta. You do so by “ordering” them through a menu. Some pastas are better than others; some are faster, some are stronger. They have varying costs, which are debited from your credits (you start with a number of credits).\\n\\nOnce spawned, your pastas start flying around. Their instinct is to fly to other plates, in order to conquer them (the objective of the game is having your pasta conquer all the plates on the table). But they are really autonomous, so after being spawned, you have no control over your pasta (think DotA or LoL creeps).\\n\\nYour pasta doesn’t like other people’s pasta, so if they meet, they shoot sauce at each other until one dies. You get credits for other pastas your own pasta kill.\\n\\nOnce a pasta is in the vicinity of a plate, it starts conquering it for its team. It takes around 10 seconds for a plate to be conquered; less if more pasta from the same team are around. If pasta from other team are around, though, they get locked down in their attempt, unable to conquer the plate, until one of them die (think Battlefield’s standard “Conquest” mode).\\n\\nYou get points every second for every plate you own.\\n\\nOver time, the concept also evolved to use an Italian bistro as its main scenario.\\n\\nCarlos, Carlos’ Bistro’s founder and owner\\n\\nSetup\\n\\nNo major changes were made from my work setup. I used FDT and Starling creating an Adobe AIR (ActionScript) project, all tools or frameworks I already had some knowledge with.\\n\\nOne big change for me was that I livestreamed my work through a twitch.tv account. This was a new thing for me. As recommended by Roushey, I used a program called XSplit and I got to say, it is pretty amazing. It made the livestream pretty effortless and the features are awesome, even for the free version. It was great to have some of my friends watch me, and then interact with them and random people through chat. It was also good knowing that I was also recording a local version of the files, so I could make a timelapse video later.\\n\\nKnowing the video was being recorded also made me a lot more self-conscious about my computer use, as if someone was watching over my shoulder. It made me realize that sometimes I spend too much time in seemingly inane tasks (I ended up wasting the longest time just to get some text alignment the way I wanted – it’ll probably drive someone crazy if they watch it) and that I do way too many typos where writing code. I pretty much spend half of the time writing a line and the other half fixing the crazy characters in it.\\n\\nMy own stream was probably boring to watch since I was coding for the most time. But livestreaming is one of the cool things to do as a spectator too. It was great seeing other people working – I had a few tabs opened on my second monitor all the time. It’s actually a bit sad, because if I could, I could have spent the whole weekend just watching other people working! But I had to do my own work, so I’d only do it once in a while, when resting for a bit.\\n\\nDesign\\n\\nAlthough I wanted some simple, low-fi, high-contrast kind of design, I ended up going with somewhat realistic (vector) art. I think it worked very well, fitting the mood of the game, but I also went overboard.\\n\\nFor example: to know the state of a plate (who owns it, who’s conquering it and how much time they have left before conquering it, which pasta units are in the queue, etc), you have to look at the plate’s bill.\\n\\nThe problem I realized when doing some tests is that people never look at the bill! They think it’s some kind of prop, so they never actually read its details.\\n\\nPlus, if you’re zoomed out too much, you can’t actually read it, so it’s hard to know what’s going on with the game until you zoom in to the area of a specific plate.\\n\\nOne other solution that didn’t turn out to be as perfect as I thought was how to indicate who a plate base belongs to. In the game, that’s indicated by the plate’s decoration – its color denotes the team owner. But it’s something that fits so well into the design that people never realized it, until they were told about it.\\n\\nIn the end, the idea of going with a full physical metaphor is one that should be done with care. Things that are very important risk becoming background noise, unless the player knows its importance.\\n\\nOriginally, I wanted to avoid any kind of heads-up display in my game. In the end, I ended up adding it at the bottom to indicate your credits and bases owned, as well as the hideous out-of-place-and-still-not-obvious “Call Waiter” button. But in hindsight, I should have gone with a simple HUD from the start, especially one that indicated each team’s colors and general state of the game without the need for zooming in and out.\\n\\nDevelopment\\n\\nDevelopment went fast. But not fast enough.\\n\\nEven though I worked around 32+ hours for this Ludum Dare, the biggest problem I had to face in the end was overscoping. I had too much planned, and couldn’t get it all done.\\n\\nContent-wise, I had several kinds of pasta planned (Wikipedia is just amazing in that regard), split into several different groups, from small Pastina to huge Pasta al forno. But because of time constraints, I ended up scratching most of them, and ended up with 5 different types of very small pasta – barely something to start when talking about the evolution of Pasta.\\n\\nPastas used in the game. Unfortunately, the macs where never used\\n\\nWhich is one of the saddest things about the project, really. It had the framework and the features to allow an endless number of elements in there, but I just didn’t have time to draw the rest of the assets needed (something I loved to do, by the way).\\n\\nOther non-obvious features had to be dropped, too. For example, when ordering some pasta, you were supposed to select what kind of sauce you’d like with your pasta, each with different attributes. Bolognese, for example, is very strong, but inaccurate; Pesto is very accurate and has great range, but it’s weaker; and my favorite, Vodka, would triggers 10% loss of speed on the pasta hit by it.\\n\\nThe code for that is mostly in there. But in the end, I didn’t have time to implement the sauce selection interface; all pasta ended up using bolognese sauce.\\n\\nTo-do list: lots of things were not done\\n\\nActual programming also took a toll in the development time. Having been programming for a while, I like to believe I got to a point where I know how to make things right, but at the expense of forgetting how to do things wrong in a seemingly good way. What I mean is that I had to take a lot of shortcuts in my code to save time (e.g. a lot of singletons references for cross-communication rather than events or observers, all-encompassing check loops, not fast enough) that left a very sour taste in my mouth. While I know I used to do those a few years ago and survive, I almost cannot accept the state my code is in right now.\\n\\nAt the same time, I do know it was the right thing to do given the timeframe.\\n\\nOne small thing that had some impact was using a somewhat new platform for me. That’s Starling, the accelerated graphics framework I used in Flash. I had tested it before and I knew how to use it well – the API is very similar to Flash itself. However, there were some small details that had some impact during development, making me feel somewhat uneasy the whole time I was writing the game. It was, again, the right thing to do, but I should have used Starling more deeply before (which is the conundrum: I used it for Ludum Dare just so I could learn more about it).\\n\\nArgument and user experience\\n\\nOne final aspect of the game that I learned is that making the game obvious for your players goes a long way into making it fun. If you have to spend the longest time explaining things, your game is doing something wrong.\\n\\nAnd that’s exactly the problem Survival of the Tastiest ultimately faced. It’s very hard for people to understand what’s going on with the game, why, and how. I did have some introductory text at the beginning, but that was a last-minute thing. More importantly, I should have had a better interface or simplified the whole concept so it would be easier for people to understand.\\n\\nThat doesn’t mean the game itself should be simple. It just means that the experience and interface should be approachable and understandable.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nI’m extremely happy with what I’ve done and, especially given that this was my first Ludum Dare. However, I feel like I’ve learned a lot of what not to do.\\n\\nThe biggest problem is overscoping. Like Eric Decker said, the biggest lesson we can learn with this is probably with scoping – deciding what to do beforehand in a way you can complete it without having to rush and do something half-assed.\\n\\nI’m sure I will do more Ludum Dares in the future.

(assuming the ban was for something rather unforgivable, 20 years is a long time?) \\nThey both could have been in the Order by then, but unlikely given Aberforth's attitude in Deathly Hallows once the trio arrive in Hogsmeade looking for the tiara.  We learn now that a lot of trafficking goes on through the Hogs Head so maybe Dung was trading with Aberforth, Sirius' mirror and various other Black artifacts, he just was not allowed in the pub. \\nAnyone with something in canon or more plausible?\\n\\nA:\\n\\nwhy was he banned?\\nI'm not able to find any canon data on that, either book text search or interviews transcripts.\\n\\nhow is it that he is then speaking to Aberforth in Halfblood Prince?\\nIn HBP, he's speaking to Aberforth, NOT being inside Hog's Head.

      "{'text': 'Working Women, Special Provision and the Debate on Equality\\n\\nThere has been considerable coverage in the media recently about the possibility of offering women in employment paid leave from work during their menstrual period. This has generated a broad range of responses relating to long-standing discussions about ‘equality’ and ‘difference’: is women’s equality best achieved by treating them the same as men or by making provisions that recognise their differences in terms of physiological constitution and biological functions?\\n\\nIf the UK introduces such an initiative, it would not be the first country in the contemporary world to do so. Many countries in Asia already make the provision and Russia debated introducing a law in 2013. The policy also has a significant historical precedent. A whole chapter of my book Women Workers in the Soviet Interwar Economy: From ‘Protection’ to ‘Equality’ (Macmillan, 1999), based on extensive research conducted for my PhD, is devoted to ‘Provision for “Menstrual Leave”’.\\n\\nIn the 1920s, scientific researchers and labour hygiene specialists in the Soviet Union conducted extensive investigations into the impact of menstruation on women’s capacity to work in manual and industrial jobs requiring a significant degree of physical labour. Their recommendations led to two decrees being issued that targeted specific categories of women workers:\\n\\nDecree ‘On the release from work during menstruation of machinists and iron press workers working on cutting machines without mechanised gears in the garment industry’, 11 January 1922\\n\\nDecree ‘On the working conditions of women tractor and lorry drivers’, 9 May 1931\\n\\nThese decrees arose from research that suggested, amongst other things, that inadequate seating at machines and on tractors resulted in congestion and tension in the abdomen that was exacerbated during menstruation. In practice, the decrees did not provide for regular absence from work. Women seeking to benefit from the provision had to provide a doctor’s note, similar to the usual requirements for sick leave.\\n\\nThe official research into the impact of menstruation on women’s capacity to work and the application of the decrees in practice raised a number of issues on both sides of the argument. I offer only a summary of the contemporary research findings and observer commentary here:\\n\\nFor the provision:\\n• employers have a responsibility to protect the health of their workers and unhealthy, poor and inadequate working environments can have a detrimental impact on women’s reproductive health\\n• women’s labour productivity and output would rise as a result\\n• it is essential to protect the professionalism of certain categories of workers: the debates here centred on performance artists and female theatrical employees engaged in highly physical and intensely emotional work\\n• heavy physical labour and strenuous exercise can lead to disruptions of the menstrual cycle\\n• women’s physical and intellectual capacities are reduced during menstruation; women lose muscular strength and powers of concentration\\n• women’s biological constitution and reproductive functions require specific recognition in law\\n\\nAgainst the provision:\\n• employers are less likely to appoint women if they are guaranteed paid time off work during menstruation\\n• (often from male workers, who viewed the employment of women as competition) women should not be employed in jobs for which they lack the physical strength and mental capacity\\n• if necessary, women could be transferred to different tasks involving easier work during menstruation\\n• the provision would be open to uneven application and abuse\\n• women cannot expect to be considered equal with men if they are given special treatment in the law\\n\\nIt is worth noting also that the various research projects often revealed that the vast majority of women reported no regular problems or abnormalities with menstruation, and that men commonly reported higher levels of sickness than their female colleagues. Many of the problems experienced by women in the workplace could be mitigated by the introduction of improvements to their physical working conditions (not sitting down or standing up in the same position for long periods of time) or by the simple introduction of very short breaks that would allow women to walk around and get some exercise.\\n\\nDebates in the UK, on the TV and in the press, are unlikely to reach a consensus on this issue.

And you’re going to have to practice patience even more as your toddler learns to become more independent.\\n\\nFor example, she tells you she can’t finish the puzzle she’s doing.

We’re not kids anymore, Tai. You _have_ a kid, you can’t act like you’re still some party guy on the coolest team at Beacon anymore—and that’s not what this is, anyways. You drink to try and forget her, you still end up in that old diner where you had your first date moping every other week—she was my _sister,_ Tai. She’s been there my _entire_ life, I feel empty without her around because I’ve never had to be without her; I know that it hurts, but you have to move forward, man. Yang deserves better than a dad who can’t stop wallowing in the past and missing someone who left on her own.”\\n_Summer deserves better than to be second to Raven’s shadow._\\n“Qrow…”\\nQrow shook his head, sighing once more. “Just—promise you’re gonna try to move on, man. Give a life without Raven—a _happy_ one—a chance. Okay?”\\n“Why do you care so much?” The question caught Qrow a little off guard, and _‘because I’m in love with Summer and I think she might be falling for you and I want you to make her happy_ ’ seemed like a terrible response. Taiyang watched him expectantly, and with a shrug, Qrow found another answer that was just as true.\\n“Because Yang’s my niece, and because you’re practically my brother. You’re my teammate, and my friend, and I’ve got to be honest, man, I hate seeing you like this. I know you, and I know you deserve more happiness than this. I just… want to see things get better for you.”\\nThey were both quiet for a few moments, and then Taiyang finally spoke. “I’ll… try, man, if you really think it’s better for Yang. But don’t make it sound so easy.”\\n“It’s not easy and I know it. Like I said—she’s my twin, it’s hard for me, too. But trying’s all we can do, and when it gets hard—when you need help, just… don’t be afraid to talk to Summer and I. Don’t be afraid to ask for help or vent—don’t rush to drink or fall apart, okay?” Pausing, Qrow started to stand again, adding earnestly, “We’re here for you, brother.”\\nHe was halfway to the door when Taiyang’s confused voice halted him. “You dyin’, Qrow?”\\nDropping his head, Qrow chuckled a little. He knew that he and Taiyang didn’t often make a habit of offering emotional talks like this, but—well, it didn’t take a death to make him get over that.\\nApparently, it just took him worrying about Summer’s happiness.\\n“No, man. Just worried about you, is all. Summer is, too. Sleep tight, Tai.”\\nFaint smile still on his face, slowly shifting to a rueful one, Qrow slipped back out of the room and made his way down the hallway once more.\\n**Notes for the Chapter:**\\n> I felt ridiculous for using 'bro' and 'man' so much during that talk, but you know these two can’t have an emotional conversation without using a surplus of those words as like a ‘we’re still manly despite our emotions tho’ and ‘no homo tho’ disclaimer.\\n>\\n> Thank you so much for reading!

Thus he may ascribe his unhappiness to something fixed and unalterable in his character or his environment: he has a 'sad disposition', or he has been treated badly by other people. Alternatively, it can be that he portrays himself under grandiloquent labels that somehow determine his place and destiny in the world: for example, the 'unfortunate individual', the 'tragic hero'. Again, and more generally, he may take refuge in a Romantic _Weltschmerz_ , using a tone of disillusioned pessimism and treating questions of practical decision as if they could be of no final significance; whatever a man does he will end up regretting. In all such ideas it is possible to find a spurious tranquillity; one can even take a quiet pride in them. For their eventual issue is 'an out and out fatalism, which always has something seductive about it' (EO ii, 241); by accepting a fatalistic or necessitarian viewpoint, the individual tacitly absolves himself from accountability for his condition as well as from an obligation to do anything about it. It is implied, however, that this is never more than a pretence, a cover, behind which he conceals his unavowed determination to remain at a stage from which he could, if he chose, release himself.\\n All in all, <PERSON>'s analysis of aestheticism is conducted with a psychological subtlety and an elaborate attention to detail that defy brief summary, and it has been possible here only to pick out some of its leading themes. As I have already indicated, he employed his basic categories in an extremely elastic way. This allowed him to point up unexpected connections between apparently diverse phenomena in a manner that can be genuinely illuminating; even so, there are times when his extended use of them seems to put their determinate significance in jeopardy, and a reader of 'Equilibrium' may be excused if he occasionally wonders if there is anything that could not, with a little ingenuity, be interpreted as 'living aesthetically'. Nor is this the sole problem which it poses. For it is not always clear whether <PERSON> is speaking of the aesthetic consciousness in quite general terms or whether, on the other hand, he is concerned with some specific manifestation of it that was of particular relevance to his own period and culture. There can, however, be no question that he supposed much of what he said to bear upon contemporary currents of thought and behaviour. At one point, for instance, it is explicitly stated that 'aesthetic melancholy', the failure 'to will deeply and sincerely', is a sickness under which 'all young Germany and France now sighs' (EO ii 193). And there are also discernible parallels between the judge's account of certain typical aesthetic attitudes and <PERSON>'s later strictures, in _The Present Age_ and elsewhere, on other tendencies implicit in the prevalent social ethos of his time: absorption in the 'outward', the external; absence of a clear sense of individual identity and responsibility; complacent acquiescence in deterministic myths as opposed to serious practical commitment; a pervasive cult of indifference presenting\", 'Mumbai: Usha Narayanan, executive director of market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) and a member of its takeover regulation advisory committee (Trac), aired her views in an interview last week on issues of control and triggers with regard to mergers and acquisitions.

Having rented Iron Man 2 at Amazon VOD, I was surprised at how little action there was, when compared to the first movie. The majority of the action takes place in the last quarter of the movie.  Now don't misunderstand me, this was a good movie and a good sequel, but I don't feel that it was better than the original. Some of the side stories were interesting, but this movie felt more like a setup for the Avengers movie. <PERSON> was pretty good as <PERSON>, and <PERSON> was a suitable replacement for <PERSON>, though I would have preferred that <PERSON> swallowed his pride and kept the original cast in place for the sequel. Unfortunately <PERSON> didn't receive enough screen time in my opinion.  All in all the movie was a 3.5-4.0, compared to my 5 star rating for Iron Man. It was a good movie, but <PERSON> could have done better.\", \"Thank you so much for all your help! I can now add books to my system.

If you want to say \"This thing,\" you\\'d say, \"这个东西\". If you want to say, \"This much,\" you\\'d say, \"这么多\".\\nI understand the reasons for the 只 and the 个, but what does the 么 really mean?\\n\\nA:\\n\\n么 has lost most of its lexical meaning in modern usage, but it appears to have originally been derived from the word 物, meaning \\'thing\\'. Chinese by Jerry Norman, pp. 119-20 makes mention of the etymology of various modern words featuring 么:\\n\\nIn an insightful article, Zhāng Hùiyīng (1982) has shown that shénme 什么, the standard modern word for \\'what\\', comes from shí wù 什物 (MC źjəp mjuət). This form (in a number of different phonological shapes) makes its first appearance in the Tang dynasty. Shí wù 什物 originally meant \\'vessels, household utensils, things (of various sorts)\\'. The development of a interrogative meaning \\'what\\' from a meaning \\'thing\\' finds a parallel in modern Italian, where cosa \\'thing\\' is also used to mean \\'what\\'. ...\\n...\\n[Regarding \\'how\\'...] In the late Tang and Wudai periods, a different form begins to be found; it consists of the verb zuò 作 (MC tsuo-) plus one of several variants of the morpheme meaning \\'thing, what\\' discussed in relation to the origins of modern shénme 什么 ... In the Wudai period, a fusion word zěn 怎 (from an earlier *zěm) based on these forms appears for the first time. It is this fusion form that is directly ancestral to the modern zěnme 怎么 \\'how\\'. Zhème 这么 \\'in this way\\' and nàme 那么 \\'in that way\\' were probably analogically based on this form.\\n\\nNotes:\\n\\nThe article by Zhāng Hùiyīng 张惠英 referenced in that excerpt refers to an article entitled 释「什么」in《中国语文》1982年第4期, pp. 302-5. I wasn\\'t easily able to obtain a copy of that article though.\\nMC in that excerpt refers to how the words were pronounced in Middle Chinese (ca. 600-1000 AD).\\n\\nWhile it\\'s interesting that 么 in these words was derived from a word meaning \\'thing\\', it\\'s essentially a bound morpheme that is no longer productive and can\\'t be used on its own. In effect, its modern usage doesn\\'t have any particular meaning in practice. In many ways, it could be considered a cranberry morpheme.\\n\\n', '<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\\n<!-- NewPage

you.\" \"Wait, hang on a second.\" \"This guy is you.\" \"I saw a profile Nova did on you.\" \"You\\'re like the youngest guy to ever graduate MIT.\" \"Standards were lower back then.\" \"You got an IQ of 178.\" \"Published three books and 35 papers, all before the age of 18?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Sorry, I really need to get going, so if I could just get you to sign off...\" \"All right.\" \"I\\'ll trade you.\" \"I\\'ll sign if you\\'ll sign.\" \"I\\'m not that guy any more.\" \"Come on, man.\" \"This is the most exciting thing that\\'s happened in this place in years.\" \"Come on, don\\'t be like that.\" \"I\\'m paying you a compliment.\" \"It\\'s not that.\" \"I\\'m...\" \"My hand\\'s not working.\" \"Hey, hey.\" \"Whoa, whoa.\" \"You okay?\" \"No.\" \"$2.32.\" \"Put it on Dr. Wilson\\'s tab.\" \"I don\\'t know who Dr. Wilson is, and we don\\'t have tabs.\" \"Do you know who I am?\" \"No.\" \"Good.\" \"But, sir...\" \"I got it.\" \"It\\'s all right.\" \"Thanks.\" \"Although, I should make it clear that for two bucks, all you get is top half, over the clothes.\" \"Any plans for turkey day?\" \"Going to my sister\\'s for dinner.\" \"Why?\" \"Just making pleasant conversation.\" \"I heard tell of folks doing such.\" \"How about we talk about this?\" \"Fifteen-year-old, recurring migraines and blurred vision.\" \"Great.\" \"Really?\" \"Sure.\" \"There\\'s no point putting a band together if we\\'re not gonna play any gigs.\" \"Hold on.\" \"Take this instead.\" \"I was expecting more resistance.\" \"That was the old me.\" \"New me is static guarded and friction free.\" \"Enjoy your drumstick.\" \"Ready to save some lives?\" \"Thirty-two-year-old courier, ataxia, anemia, mild cough.\" \"CT was clear, tox screen negative.\" \"What are you so excited about?\" \"Why wouldn\\'t I be?\" \"Got all my starters back, plus a couple of first-class free agents.\" \"I feel like Mike Tomlin.\" \"Probably not as much as you do, but you get the idea.\" \"Ataxia and anemia, could be viral, maybe West Nile.\" \"No fever, lymph glands were normal.\" \"Anybody seen Wilson?\" \"Hyperbilirubinemia?\" \"Yeah, like that\\'s a real thing.\" \"Meningitis.\" \"Anemia\\'s a stretch.\" \"Page Dr. James Wilson at 558.\" \"What about sickle cell?\" \"The guy\\'s white.\" \"Whites can get it.\" \"Come on.\" \"We get the tennis elbow and all the money, let them have sickle cell.\" \"TTP is a better fit.\" \"He\\'s right.\" \"What, you thought I wouldn\\'t agree with him?\" \"Ever?\" \"Well, you didn\\'t agree with him.\" \"That\\'s why he dumped you.\" \"Oh, sorry, it was mutual.\" \"We\\'re cool, okay?\" \"Nobody\\'s angry, nobody\\'s hurt.\" \"Sounds passionate.\" \"TTP makes sense to me.\" \"Not to me.\" \"What if he had a history of...\" \"One big happy family.\" \"TTP it is.\" \"Confirm with a blood smear and ADAMTS13 antibodies.\" \"Dr. James Wilson, please dial 558.\" \"Can you cure it?\" \"TTP isn\\'t completely curable, but the symptoms are manageable with the proper treatment.\" \"Is this the treatment?\" \"No.\" \"First we need to do a blood test to confirm the diagnosis.\" \"But he\\'s gonna get better?\" \"Honey, that\\'s what she\\'s saying.\" \"I\\'m gonna be okay.\" \"Don\\'t worry.\" \"How can\\'t I worry?\" \"You\\'re in the hospital.\" \"I\\'m gonna be fine.\" \"Are you sure everything was fine before?\" \"I mean, given your educational background, you\\'d think you could at least find a job with a medical plan.\" \"We have money.\" \"Don\\'t worry.\" \"It\\'s not that.\" \"It\\'s just I want to make sure we have all the information we should.\" \"My husband wouldn\\'t lie.\" \"It\\'s okay, baby.\" \"He\\'s just doing his job.\" \"He just wants to make sure I\\'m not a secret drug addict or an alcoholic.\" \"Or hiding a history of mental illness.\" \"I work as a courier because I want to.\" \"It\\'s easy.\" \"I don\\'t have to think.\" \"It\\'s too hard to think?\" \"No.\" \"Just unpleasant.\" \"No matter what I did, it really wasn\\'t good enough.\" \"Then I met Dara.\" \"She didn\\'t care how smart I was, or what I might accomplish in the future.\" \"It was the first time in my life that I was really happy.\" \"So I decided I would rather be happy than smart.\" \"You all right?\" \"Sorry.\" \"I know you\\'re not okay.\" \"I mean...\" \"She left.\" \"Went back to Chicago.\" \"Any chance of reconciliation?\" \"No.\" \"You sure you don\\'t wanna grab a drink after work?\" \"I figured we could talk about the perils of dating doctors.\" \"I wasn\\'t dating Cameron.\" \"I\\'m sorry.\" \"I didn\\'t mean to...\" \"I know what you\\'re doing, and I appreciate it.\" \"But I\\'ve got it under control.\" \"That\\'s what you said about the Dibala incident, and obviously you didn\\'t.\" \"And talking about it obviously made things so much better.\" \"Didn\\'t you think there was something weird about that guy?\" \"Not really.\" \"In fact, he seemed pretty normal.\" \"That\\'s my point.\" \"Guys with IQs off the chart are usually completely abnormal.\" \"Speaking of House, why did you come back?\" \"I mean, you must have taken a major pay cut.\" \"Life\\'s too short to worry about money.\" \"Your wife feel the same way?\" \"She\\'s happy to cut back on some things.\" \"Like sex.\" \"Why\\'d you come back?\" \"Why wouldn\\'t I?\" \"Like Foreman said, nobody\\'s angry, nobody\\'s hurt.\" \"Schistocytes.\" \"That means TTP.\" \"Which is what we thought it\\'d be, remember?\" \"This is a good thing.\" \"This is an easy thing, and House doesn\\'t take cases that are easy, which means it\\'s not TTP.\" \"And he wants to see how long it takes us to catch up to him.\" \"Schistocytes suggest TTP.\" \"Good, now what?\" \"Normally we\\'d try plasmapheresis, but the patient has an albumin colloid allergy.\" \"So?\" \"So that means we have to give him a splenectomy.\" \"Yes, it does.\" \"Wilson?\" \"No.\" \"Do you know where he is?\" \"Not in here.\" \"You\\'re sure you want us to take out his spleen?\" \"Is that what a splenectomy is?\" \"I thought it was an ice cream treat.\" \"Yuck.\" \"So you do really think he has TTP.\" \"You\\'re not just testing us.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Like I have time for games.\" \"So, why did you really take this case?\" \"Isn\\'t it obvious?\" \"I\\'m fishing for a dinner invite.\" \"Missed you at breakfast this morning.\" \"And lunch.\" \"I had a dentist appointment.\" \"You know where Cuddy\\'s sister lives?\" \"You see, this is why I don\\'t answer your urgent pages, because they\\'re not urgent pages.\" \"I\\'ve decided what I\\'m gonna do about Cuddy and Lucas.\" \"I\\'m going to break them up.\" \"Of course.\" \"It\\'s given me a purpose in life, a goal, a raison d\\'etre.\" \"Albeit a selfish, mean-spirited, childish raison.\" \"I think of it more as benevolent.\" \"There\\'s only two possible outcomes for their relationship, they split or they stay together forever.\" \"If it\\'s split, then the sooner it happens, the better for everyone.\" \"If it\\'s stay, then my meddling won\\'t matter.\" \"In fact, if they survive it, it might even make their bond stronger.\" \"How you manage to elevate your narcissism to beneficence is masterful.\" \"And I\\'ve decided to do it at Thanksgiving dinner, just \\'cause I\\'m sentimental.\" \"Dinner\\'s at Cuddy\\'s sister\\'s, which brings us back to...\" \"House, don\\'t.\" \"I fished for an invite.\" \"Cuddy wasn\\'t biting, so I\\'ll have to crash.\" \"I have no idea where Cuddy\\'s sister lives.\" \"Ask and thou shalt receive.\" \"You can\\'t honestly think I would help you with this.\" \"Not help me, help Cuddy, remember?\" \"If you don\\'t get it, I\\'ll be forced to use more nefarious methods.\" \"Happy holidays.\" \"Ah.\" \"Looks great.\" \"So, he\\'s all better?\" \"Probably be on some long-term meds, and he\\'s about 10 ounces lighter, other than that, he won\\'t even know it\\'s gone.\" \"Did you hear that, honey?\" \"You\\'re gonna be just fine.\" \"When can I get out of here?\" \"If everything checks out, less than a week.\" \"Good. \\'Cause those boxes aren\\'t gonna deliver colors.\" \"Colors?\" \"Green and orange and ceiling.\" \"Mr. Sidas, do you know where you are?\" \"Chewing.\" \"Jimmy?\" \"Shirt.\" \"He\\'s stroking.\" \"Call the cath lab, now!\" \"Oh, my God.\" \"Blood flow\\'s restored, appears to be no permanent damage.\" \"Good news is it turns out to be an exciting, action-packed thrill ride of a case after all.\" \"Bad news is we took out his spleen for nothing.\" \"Thank God he\\'s still got his appendix and tonsils.\" \"So what looks like TTP, acts like TTP,\" \"Tests like TTP, but isn\\'t TTP?\" \"CNS Vasculitis, explains the ataxia and anemia, maybe the stroke.\" \"CT would have picked up something.\" \"Hi, I\\'m Greg House.\" \"I\\'m a friend of your sister, Lisa.\" \"Could be DIC.\" \"Lisa Cuddy.\" \"Sorry, wrong number.\" \"You gonna ask?\" \"I\\'m sure he\\'s got a perfectly logical explanation.\" \"Can\\'t be DIC, no hemorrhaging.\" \"And I\\'m calling all 12 Julia Cuddys within 100-mile radius.\" \"See?\" \"Completely reasonable.\" \"Acquired pancytopenia?\" \"WBC\\'s normal.\" \"Hey, Julia.\" \"You\\'re Lisa\\'s sister, right?\" \"Are you sure?\" \"You are number 12.\" \"Maybe she got married and changed her name.\" \"Otis Campbell.\" \"Probably kept her first name.\" \"The mnemonic for toxins.\" \"\"O\" for organophosphates, \"T\" for tricyclics, \"l\" for insulin...\" \"Or as I remember it, \"Moist Place.\"\" \"That\\'s \"Place\" spelled with two \"L\"s and a silent \"B.\"\" \"Except the tox screen was negative.\" \"Standard tox screen.\" \"Unstandard toxins don\\'t show up on it.\" \"Well, you two do an unstandard tox screen.\" \"You two search his home.\" \"Otis Campbell\\'s gotta be hiding somewhere.\" \"Smartest guy in the world and this is the best he can do?\" \"Maybe he\\'s doing what he loves.\" \"Delivering boxes was a childhood dream.\" \"Soda, processed cheese, marshmallow spread.\" \"Nothing in here is capable of going bad.\" \"Ibuprofen, eye drops, cough syrup.\" \"You want to come over for Thanksgiving dinner?\" \"You never asked me over before, why now?\" \"Just never thought of it.\" \"But now that we\\'re both on the team...\" \"And my wife left me?\" \"Is that a bad reason?\" \"No, but I\\'m okay.\" \"On both the food and friends.\" \"Mice.\" \"Leptospirosis could explain the ataxia and the anemia.\" \"But not without a fever.\" \"You have someone to talk to?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Who?\" \"What, you want names?\" \"Look, you lost a friend, I get it.\" \"But I\\'m not Kutner.\" \"Good. \\'Cause Kutner never used to come over for dinner.\" \"I\\'m going to pretend there\\'s something interesting over here, so you\\'ll shut up.\" \"Actually, there is.\" \"He\\'s got sketches of atomic structure.\" \"This one is full of math proofs.\" \"They\\'re all old.\" \"Nothing since \\'96.\" \"This isn\\'t some homework assignment his parents forced on him, this is passion.\" \"Why would he want to stop doing this?\" \"Marriage destroyed his soul?\" \"Ooh.\" \"Or maybe it was just the booze.\" \"Thank you, Doctor.\" \"You\\'ve been wonderful.\" \"As have you, Diana.\" \"Be well.\" \"Thank you.\" \"You\\'re helping.\" \"Voluntarily.\" \"He\\'s done six already.\" \"I figured you might be getting backed up with the holiday season and all.\" \"So which one of us slipped through the wormhole into an alternate dimension?\" \"I have always loved to travel.\" \"And paint.\" \"Lucky number seven.\" \"House, I know you\\'re trying to be nice.\" \"But I also know you\\'re doing it because you have an agenda.\" \"Wow.\" \"Sexy and smart.\" \"Lucas is a lucky guy.\" \"The question is, is this a bad agenda or a good one?\" \"Either you\\'re trying to screw with me, or you\\'re trying to show me that you\\'ve really changed.\" \"So which is it?\" \"I\\'m dying to know.\" \"What are you doing for Thanksgiving dinner?\" \"Peace in our time!\" \"Only cost me 45 minutes of clinic duty.\" \"This is a three-hour drive.\" \"Have you considered the possibility that this is a fake address?\" \"You think she\\'d send me to a vacant lot for Thanksgiving dinner?\" \"If she\\'s smart.\" \"She is.\" \"That\\'s why I ran it through Motor Vehicles.\" \"Good as gold.\" \"This cannot end well.\" \"Don\\'t want it to end well.\" \"You should come as my date.\" \"You\\'re not gonna want to miss this.\" \"The unstandard tox screen was as clean as the standard one.\" \"But we found vodka stashed away in his place.\" \"What\\'s with the ties?\" \"Makes me look adorably non-threatening.\" \"Party or party-hearty?\" \"Liver failure would explain all the symptoms.\" \"Party.\" \"So, the guy\\'s a brainiac and his secret drug of choice is booze?\" \"It\\'s kind of pedestrian, don\\'t you think?\" \"Talk to him, he\\'s a pedestrian guy.\" \"With pedestrian alcoholism.\" \"Liver biopsy can wait until after Thanksgiving.\" \"Yes, assuming the biopsy is going to tell us exactly what we expect it to tell us, it can wait till after New Years.\" \"On the other hand, Taub and Thirteen can do the liver biopsy today.\" \"Why us?\" \"Juniority.\" \"Welcome back.\" \"What do you want us to do?\" \"Same as me.\" \"Have a happy Thanksgiving.\" \"I\\'m not an alcoholic.\" \"Yes, you just hide vodka around the house for fun.\" \"I drink, just not a lot.\" \"Since when do you drink at all?\" \"I have one shot when I get home from work, baby.\" \"That\\'s it.\" \"So why lie to your wife about it?\" \"Because it\\'s not important.\" \"What difference does it make?\" \"That you drink every day, by yourself?\" \"I have one lousy drink, okay?\" \"Have you ever seen me drunk?\" \"Ever?\" \"No, but you\\'ve obviously been drinking enough to hurt your liver.\" \"My liver is fine.\" \"Hold still.\" \"There we go.\" \"This test is a waste of time.\" \"Hey.\" \"This wine?\" \"All right.\" \"Very good.\" \"There, we got this...\" \"String beans?\" \"Julia?\" \"No, I\\'m the house sitter.\" \"They\\'re in Hawaii for the week.\" \"Happy Thanksgiving.\" \"Happy Thanksgiving, you guys.\" \"Happy Thanksgiving.\" \"Cheers.\" \"Cheers.\" \"You must be Dr. House.\" \"I was told I should offer you a turkey sandwich.\" \"Tuna salad.\" \"Closest thing they had to turkey.\" \"Thanks.\" \"But I\\'m hoping I can still get out of here and catch the tail end of dinner with my wife.\" \"Anything?\" \"No cirrhosis, no scarring, no infection.\" \"Blood panel?\" \"Elevated albumin, 7.2.\" \"That\\'s it?\" \"Everything else is fine.\" \"So it was a waste of time.\" \"Unless, it\\'s not his liver that\\'s elevating his albumin, it\\'s his kidneys.\" \"Renal failure.\" \"Explains the anemia.\" \"If he developed hyperkalemia, that would explain the ataxia, but the stroke...\" \"Ischemic encephalopathy.\" \"Nice.\" \"Except now we have to stay and test his kidneys.\" \"Key under the mat.\" \"There\\'s no key under the mat.\" \"Oh, right.\" \"You need to replace one of your kitchen windows.\" \"I helped myself to your wine cellar.\" \"I\\'ll leave a buck on the way out.\" \"You\\'re not right for her.\" \"And you are?\" \"Less wrong.\" \"Ah.\" \"But then I started thinking...\" \"What was I saying?\" \"You were saying it\\'s late and...\" \"She invited me.\" \"She didn\\'t know if she should.\" \"She was trying to figure out if I really have changed or if I\\'m still the same old SOB I\\'ve always been.\" \"But she always gave me a chance.\" \"Eight hundred and thirty-two chances, and I used up every one of them.\" \"Eight hundred and thirty-two\\'s her limit, make a note.\" \"How about a cup of coffee?\" \"It\\'s just instant, but...\" \"I\\'m pathetic.\" \"I don\\'t deserve her.\" \"Okay.\" \"Okay.\" \"All right.\" \"Here.\" \"Maybe you should crash here.\" \"It\\'s a sofa bed.\" \"I love her.\" \"Patient\\'s liver is fine, it\\'s his kidneys that are shot.\" \"And where the hell is House?\" \"He left a message on the machine.\" \"He\\'s not coming in today.\" \"So what causes kidney failure?\" \"Rhabdomyolysis.\" \"No edema.\" \"I trust you had a wonderful Thanksgiving.\" \"I don\\'t remember.\" \"So I guess I did.\" \"Multiple myeloma.\" \"No bone pain.\" \"You got drunk alone?\" \"No.\" \"That would be a sign that I need to talk to you about this.\" \"Polycystic kidney disease.\" \"No UTIs or flank pain.\" \"Well, what if his cough is more than just a cold?\" \"He hasn\\'t been coughing.\" \"It\\'s in his history, and we found a new bottle of cough syrup in his medicine cabinet.\" \"Cough could mean Goodpasture Syndrome, affects kidneys and lungs.\" \"Start him on immunosuppressors and dialysis.\" \"We\\'ll do it right after we run it by House.\" \"He\\'s not answering his pager.\" \"Looks like he\\'s leaving it up to us.\" \"Us.\" \"Not you.\" \"And since we don\\'t disagree, you can save your fight for another case.\" \"How long do I have to be hooked up for?\" \"Four to six hours a day until we see an improvement.\" \"What if you don\\'t?\" \"Then we keep doing it until he gets a transplant.\" \"You were sure it was his spleen, and then you were sure it was his liver, which he told you it wasn\\'t, and now you\\'re sure it\\'s his kidneys.\" \"It\\'s definitely his kidneys.\" \"We just don\\'t know why it\\'s his kidneys.\" \"Any word from Cameron?\" \"Nope.\" \"I started seeing a counselor after my diagnosis.\" \"She\\'s really good.\" \"Why does everyone assume that everyone works in the exact same way?\" \"We pretty much do.\" \"Our egos want us to think we\\'re all snowflakes, no two alike, but really, we all want the same things, love, forgiveness, chocolate.\" \"Well, what I want is for everyone to leave me alone.\" \"How do I get that?\" \"What did you say to Lucas last night?\" \"I know there were a lot of consonants.\" \"I don\\'t remember how I got here, never mind what I said.\" \"Well, I just talked to him.\" \"And he said he thought it\\'d be better if we stopped seeing each other.\" \"Said he didn\\'t realize how much there still was between you and me.\" \"And he didn\\'t want to get caught in the middle of us.\" \"I was drunk.\" \"Whatever I said, he can\\'t really...\" \"I\\'ve had enough, House.\" \"I actually felt bad about scamming you, but then you lived down to my expectations, and then some.\" \"There is no us.\" \"There never will be.\" \"It worked.\" \"Please tell me you\\'re talking about a medical procedure.\" \"They split up this morning.\" \"You\\'re the very first one I\\'ve told.\" \"And you think she\\'ll start dating you?\" \"I\\'m sure she hates you.\" \"But her eyes say,\" \"\"How will I ever pay you for that tennis lesson?\"\" \"What a shame.\" \"They\\'ll get over it.\" \"I meant for you.\" \"I\\'ll get over it faster than they do.\" \"I can\\'t believe that Lucas fell for my\" \"\"I\\'d never say this because it\\'s so personal\" \"\"except that I\\'m drunk\" profession of love.\" \"Second oldest trick in the book.\" \"You\\'re right.\" \"It\\'s his fault because he\\'s stupid.\" \"He certainly is.\" \"You\\'re stupid.\" \"Well, I\\'m rubber and you\\'re glue...\" \"He\\'s not pedestrian, he\\'s stupid.\" \"Or at least stupider than he should be.\" \"He\\'s a DXM junkie.\" \"Dextromethorphan.\" \"As in cough syrup?\" \"He wasn\\'t taking it for his cough.\" \"It\\'s cheap, available at your corner drugstore, and taken in high doses, it\\'s a dumb drug.\" \"Dumb drug?\" \"He obviously hasn\\'t...\" \"He\\'s smart compared to you, he\\'s a moron compared to what he was.\" \"Robotripping lowers the IQ, it also causes brain damage.\" \"Unless taken with the proper amount of ethanol, about one drink per day.\" \"He wasn\\'t abusing the booze and taking the cough remedy medicinally, he was abusing the cough meds and taking the booze medicinally.\" \"Bravo.\" \"Why would you do that?\" \"If you had a gift, why would you just throw it away?\" \"I didn\\'t throw it away.\" \"I just turned it down a little.\" \"When my brain was on low, everything didn\\'t seem so miserable any more.\" \"Life was bearable.\" \"I thought that I did that.\" \"You do.\" \"Long-term abuse of DXM explains all your symptoms.\" \"Even, oh, sweet irony, your cough.\" \"Whole bowel lavage, activated charcoal.\" \"We get all traces of it out of your system, you\\'ll be the unhappiest little courier in no time.\" \"I don\\'t think I can live without it.\" \"You\\'d be surprised what you can live without.\" \"Make him a genius.\" \"I can\\'t believe it.\" \"He looks so much better already.\" \"We were thinking about calling GQ.\" \"Lavage has removed all traces of DXM from his body.\" \"You\\'re drawing again.\" \"What is it?\" \"Just doodles.\" \"No, it\\'s not.\" \"Come on, Jimmy, I want to know.\" \"This is a toroidal helicon plasma device.\" \"It determines the amount of energy expended by the subatomic particles.\" \"I\\'m thirsty.\" \"Could you get me a juice or something?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Of course.\" \"I\\'m so happy, Jimmy.\" \"I told you.\" \"You know what the difference between her IQ and mine is?\" \"91 points.\" \"In relation, she\\'s closer to a gibbon than she is to me.\" \"Having sex with her would be an act of bestiality.\" \"I assume you didn\\'t marry her for her skill in Applied Physics.\" \"I just wish she could spell it.\" \"You really think you\\'d be happier with someone who could spell better?\" \"No.\" \"That\\'s the problem.\" \"I\\'m the one who\\'s a jerk.\" \"But I owe her everything.\" \"I want to want to be with her.\" \"And when I\\'m clear, I...\" \"I can\\'t.\" \"Fainting, dizziness, shortness of breath?\" \"Sometimes.\" \"Is the wait always this long?\" \"Only on days that end in \"day.\" \"\" Diarrhea, weight loss?\" \"A bit.\" \"Don\\'t you ever shave?\" \"Yeah, once a week.\" \"How about you?\" \"Stomach pain, tenderness?\" \"Every now and then.\" \"Are you this rude to all your patients?\" \"Oh, yes, don\\'t think you\\'re special.\" \"So we got a lot of vague, unverifiable symptoms, yet all the physical signs are perfectly normal.\" \"What do you think I have?\" \"I\\'m not sure, but I think it\\'s a lame job.\" \"What?\" \"You\\'re a rat.\" \"Insurance company sends you out to check on the quality of medical care.\" \"That\\'s ridiculous.\" \"Is it really?\" \"\\'Cause you seem a lot more interested in asking questions than answering them.\" \"Handwriting in your medical records is obviously not a doctor\\'s, \\'cause I can almost read it.\" \"And when you went out for a urine sample, I looked in your purse.\" \"Found the list of questions you were supposed to memorize before you came to the clinic.\" \"I was looking for gum.\" \"You\\'re an ass.\" \"Put it in your report.\" \"I\\'ll tell you what.\" \"I\\'ll give you 20 bucks if you\\'ll pretend that I\\'m not when we leave this room.\" \"Remember, first ice, then heat.\" \"If you have any problems, don\\'t hesitate to call me.\" \"Thank you, Dr. House.\" \"Wait a second.\" \"Where\\'s Cuddy?\" \"Gone for the day.\" \"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" \"Sorry, can\\'t remember if I\\'ve mocked you yet for being a male nurse.\" \"I think this counts.\" \"Fair enough.\" \"That isn\\'t the man I married.\" \"Yes, he is.\" \"He\\'s just smarter.\" \"Give him some time.\" \"I\\'m sure...\" \"He hates me.\" \"His body is going through withdrawal.\" \"He\\'s adjusting.\" \"Maybe he never loved me.\" \"Not really.\" \"Maybe we never really had anything at all.\" \"Somebody help!\" \"I can\\'t feel my legs.\" \"I can\\'t feel my legs.\" \"Anywhere.\" \"Nothing.\" \"We have to talk about this.\" \"It\\'s late.\" \"I\\'m tired.\" \"I know it\\'s a big pay cut, but I\\'ll always have the chance to make money.\" \"I won\\'t always have the chance to do this job.\" \"That\\'s what you think?\" \"That it\\'s about the money?\" \"So it\\'s that I didn\\'t consult you before I took the job?\" \"That was offensive, but it\\'s not about that either.\" \"So then...\" \"Can you give me the first letter?\" \"When we got married, you were an intern working 30-hour shifts, doing grunt work, and we both put up with it because we knew that it was leading to something better.\" \"In your private practice, you are the boss.\" \"You call the shots.\" \"But now, you\\'re 40 years old, you\\'re still doing grunt work.\" \"That\\'s what this is about?\" \"You think I\\'m a wuss?\" \"He made you miss Thanksgiving dinner.\" \"Vitamin B12 deficiency gives us anemia, numbness...\" \"Not a stroke.\" \"If he has a vascular malformation...\" \"Anemia\\'s not macrocytic.\" \"Sorry to inconvenience you.\" \"Dying patients can be so thoughtless.\" \"Don\\'t.\" \"Great comeback.\" \"Is that Oscar Wilde?\" \"Come on, people.\" \"Bone marrow malignancy.\" \"Wouldn\\'t produce schistocytes.\" \"Lupus.\" \"Gee, thanks for coming in.\" \"ANA was negative.\" \"What about you?\" \"You got any predictable drivel you\\'d like to add?\" \"I think they\\'ve given you enough already.\" \"At least they\\'re trying, not just sitting there like roadkill.\" \"Give me something!\" \"Give me something or I\\'ll get your ex-smarter half on the phone and ask her.\" \"House...\" \"You\\'re going to be pressing charges?\" \"Against the ottoman I tripped over?\" \"Against Chase.\" \"I\\'m pretty sure the ottoman was acting alone.\" \"You free for dinner this weekend?\" \"At least three other people saw him do it.\" \"Mass hysteria.\" \"Either night?\" \"I can\\'t have doctors punching each other out.\" \"Oh, my God, who got punched?\" \"And more importantly, for Chase\\'s sake,\" \"I need to know if he\\'s able to handle himself or if I should be getting him some help.\" \"Chase couldn\\'t have punched anyone.\" \"He was with me when I tripped over the ottoman.\" \"If you\\'re not planning on eating this weekend, maybe a movie?\" \"I\\'m not doing this, House.\" \"It\\'s not fun any more.\" \"Just do your job.\" \"I need your help.\" \"What happened to your face?\" \"I was mowing the lawn when the phone rang.\" \"You\\'re a computer.\" \"I\\'m gonna feed you data, and you analyze it.\" \"What are you gonna feed me, 20 years of medical knowledge, too?\" \"It\\'s not gonna work.\" \"I know.\" \"But I don\\'t have anyone else to ask.\" \"It\\'s lonely, isn\\'t it?\" \"It\\'s not that bad.\" \"Then you\\'re not that smart.\" \"You ever try to kill yourself?\" \"Not quickly.\" \"I did.\" \"Twelve years ago, I jumped off the top of my eight-story building into a dumpster bin the day before pick-up.\" \"I broke my collar bone, my leg and three ribs.\" \"When I was in the hospital, they put me on narcotics and suddenly everything was just better.\" \"I didn\\'t feel isolated or lonely.\" \"That\\'s where I met my wife.\" \"She was so happy and dumb.\" \"And I was smart and miserable.\" \"You tell me who the genius is.\" \"I fell in love with her buzzed out of my head and I knew I wanted to stay that way forever.\" \"Enjoy.\" \"Easier on your conscience if I die an idiot?\" \"What\\'s a conscience?\" \"Which ribs did you break in the fall?\" \"Down the left side?\" \"Yeah, bottom three.\" \"But that was 12 years ago.\" \"This probably cost me my marriage, so it better be awesome.\" \"Ferrous oxide contrast?\" \"It gets absorbed by the spleen, unless he doesn\\'t have one, in which case it\\'s absorbed by the liver and fries that.\" \"You\\'re killing him?\" \"You think I opened him up and didn\\'t take out his spleen?\" \"All organs do look kind of the same, red and squishy.\" \"Oh, my God.\" \"Accessory spleens.\" \"Okay, that is amazing.\" \"Twelve years, eight stories and a dumpster ago, he broke three ribs, damaged his spleen.\" \"Bits of it split off, circulated through his blood stream until they landed and attached somewhere else.\" \"So, it is TTP.\" \"I just didn\\'t remove all of his spleens.\" \"Sixteen splenectomies, pretty sure he gets a set of steak knives with that.\" \"I can outrun you.\" \"Sorry about the nose.\" \"And the eye.\" \"And the eyebrow.\" \"Guess I deserved it.\" \"Well, if I thought that, I wouldn\\'t be apologizing.\" \"Your fist slipped?\" \"Everybody kept bugging me, asking if I was okay.\" \"So you bust my nose to keep people off your

All three were\\ndressed in white, and looked as delightfully cool, sweet and airy, with\\ntheir floating white ribbons and wind-blown curls, as summer maidens\\ncan possibly look.\\n\\n\"If I were an artist, I would immortalize that glorious scene,\" cried\\nLily Ryder, her blue eyes sparkling with the fire of enthusiasm.\\n\\n\"And if I were an artist, I would paint _you_,\" cried a handsome,\\nfair-haired young man _sotto voce_, who had stopped short in his stroll\\nalong the sands with his friend, to admire the three lovely young\\ngirls, feeling sure that his keen scrutiny would not be observed, they\\nwere gazing so intently out to sea.\\n\\n\"Who are they, Ravenswood?\" he asked, eagerly, turning to his\\ncompanion. \"You know everyone at Newport worth knowing, of course--\\'a\\ngolden key throws open all doors.\\'\"\\n\\n\"Oh, of course,\" echoed Philip Ravenswood, with the slow drawl habitual\\nto him. \"They are called at Newport \\'The Three Graces.\\' The blonde\\nfairy to the right is Lily Ryder, an ex-governor\\'s daughter. The\\nbewitching girl in the center of the group is Miss Hildegarde Cramer,\\na banker\\'s daughter; and, by the way, she\\'s one of the jolliest girls\\nthat ever dazzled a fellow\\'s wits as well as his eyes--looks more\\nbewitching every time you see her.\"\\n\\n\"But who is the other young girl?\" interrupted his companion,\\nimpatiently. \"According to my ideas of feminine loveliness, she\\'s far\\nthe prettiest of the three.\"\\n\\n\"Hold on, my dear Royal Ainsley, lest you provoke a duel here and now.\\nRemember, that trio contains the peerless Hildegarde,\" laughed Philip\\nRavenswood, relighting a fresh Havana.\\n\\n\"All allowance made for difference of opinion,\" smiled Ainsley; \"but\\nreally, Phil, who is the dark-eyed beauty this way?\"\\n\\nLittle dreaming of what would come of those few idly spoken words,\\nPhilip Ravenswood answered, carelessly:\\n\\n\"Her name is Ida May. She\\'s the only living relative of the Mays of\\nBoston, I understand. I do not know the Mays personally, but know them\\nwell by reputation. They are fabulously rich, it is generally believed.\"\\n\\n\"Suppose you introduce me to the Three Graces,\" said Royal Ainsley,\\nbanteringly.\\n\\nHis companion flushed, and looked a trifle uncomfortable.\\n\\n\"At another time, my dear fellow,\" he said, answering Ainsley\\'s\\nquestion after a moment\\'s pause. \"Let the girls enjoy their rhapsodies\\nover the sunset in peace this time. We really haven\\'t time just now.\\nThe fellows are waiting for us at the club, you know.\"\\n\\nBut Ainsley refused to go on; yet he did it in such a gay, off-hand,\\nrollicking, fun-loving fashion, his friend did not see the fixed\\npurpose in his action.\\n\\nHe was quite sure that if they stood there long enough they could not\\nhelp attracting the attention of the pretty maidens, and there was\\nno time like the present to meet them. In this surmise, he was quite\\ncorrect. Attracted by the sound of voices almost behind them, Miss\\nRyder glanced around.\\n\\n\"Hildegarde--Ida!\" she exclaimed, in a flutter of delighted surprise,\\n\"why, here is Mr. Ravenswood!\"\\n\\nShe stopped short, for just then she observed that the handsome young\\ngentleman in the white linen suit, standing a little apart from Mr.\\nRavenswood, was with him.\\n\\nIt was too late to beat a retreat then, for he had been discovered. He\\nwas certainly in for it, and there was no help for it but to bring his\\ncompanion forward with the best possible grace and present him to the\\nyoung ladies.\\n\\nAinsley bowed low in his most charming manner, raising, with a smile,\\nhis white straw hat from his fair, clustering hair, and Philip\\nRavenswood could see, with consternation, the apparent admiration for\\nhis friend on all three girlish faces, including Hildegarde, whom he\\nhad believed to be quite smitten with himself.\\n\\nRoyal Ainsley made the most of that next half hour on the sands. He was\\nso brilliant, so witty, so clever, he fairly astonished his friend,\\nused as he was to his gay _bon-mots_ and to see him the life of all\\nthe affairs at the club.\\n\\nThey chatted brightly enough, until Hildegarde exclaimed, with a little\\ncry:\\n\\n\"Why, there is some bell striking seven! We have been here over an\\nhour. We must get back to the hotel, girls, or we will never be dressed\\nfor dinner. Won\\'t you stroll back that way with us?\" she added, with a\\ndazzling smile to both of the young gentlemen.\\n\\n\"I think not,\" replied Ainsley, quickly, taking it upon himself to\\nanswer for his friend. \"We have an engagement, and have barely time to\\nsave ourselves from being the annoying cause of giving our friends a\\ncold dinner.\"\\n\\n\"We hope to see you both soon again,\" said Lily, with another blush.\\n\\n\"We do, indeed!\" echoed Hildegarde, archly. But the girl with the\\nvelvet <DW29> eyes made no audible remark, though her crimson lips\\nparted, then shut quickly again.\\n\\nThe next moment the two gentlemen were gone, and the three young girls\\nretraced their steps slowly hotelward along the beach. They had a much\\npleasanter subject to discuss now than the sunset.\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t the new-comer handsome?\" remarked Lily.\\n\\n\"Splendid! but not quite as Phil, though.\"\\n\\nAgain they both asked together:\\n\\n\"What say _you_, Ida?\"\\n\\nThe girl with cheeks like a damask rose and velvety <DW29> eyes blushed\\nto the roots of her jetty curls.\\n\\n\"He is like the hero of a novel. I have never seen any one so handsome\\nbefore--so fair, so smiling--so--so--delightful,\" she answered.\\n\\n\"Ida May\\'s heart has been hit by the first shot of those arrows of blue\\neyes,\" laughed Lily, mockingly. \"I knew when she declared that, come\\nwhat would, she would not fall in love with any young man she met at\\nNewport, she was more than likely to meet her fate.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II.\\n\\n\\nFor some moments the two young men walked on in silence, which was at\\nlast broken by Ainsley.\\n\\n\"I say, Phil,\" he began, eagerly, laying his hand on his friend\\'s\\nshoulder, \"do you think any one of those three beauties would accept\\nan invitation to go down and see the yacht-race with me to-morrow\\nafternoon?\"\\n\\nRavenswood looked shocked.\\n\\n\"You are surely jesting to ask my opinion as to whether any one of\\nthose young girls would accompany _a stranger_ to a place of amusement.\\nYou certainly know, as well as I do, that they wouldn\\'t entertain such\\na thought for an instant. And even suppose they did? Their parents\\nwould soon let you know what _they_ thought on the subject. Like all\\nsweet rosebuds, they are guarded by thorns. A very stern _duenna_\\nusually accompanies them on their afternoon rambles, and woe to\\nanything masculine who attempts to hold a few moments\\' conversation\\nwith any one of them. I confess I was surprised to find them alone\\nto-day--very much surprised, I must say.\"\\n\\n\"Fate interposed in my behalf,\" laughed Ainsley, nonchalantly; adding:\\n\"I tell you, Phil, I am a strong believer in fate, no matter what\\nany one says to the contrary, believing with the poet--everything is\\npreordained, planned out ahead for us, and we can not escape it.\\nWe are to meet certain people. One girl makes no impression upon us\\nwhatever, no matter how pretty she may be; we meet another, and lo!\\nwith the first glance from her eyes, the mischief\\'s done--_we_ are done\\nfor. Now, am I not correct?\"\\n\\n\"I hope you have not made such a fool of yourself as to fall in love at\\nfirst sight with any one of those young ladies to whom I was mad enough\\nto introduce you, Ainsley!\" cried Ravenswood, very much nettled.\\n\\n\"And why not, pray?\" returned Royal Ainsley, coolly. \"You should blame\\nfate if I have done so, not me, my dear fellow.\"\\n\\n\"I am sorry for you, Ainsley, if such is indeed a fact,\" declared\\nPhilip Ravenswood, gravely, \"for I do not think you could win the girl.\\nPlainly speaking, you are no match for either of them. You know that.\\nBut which one of them is it?\"\\n\\n\"The one with the <DW29> velvet dark eyes--with the face of a damask\\nrose--Ida May, I believe you called her.\"\\n\\nRavenswood looked wonderfully relieved. As long as it was not\\nHildegarde, he would not trouble himself.\\n\\n\"By George!\" exclaimed Ainsley, stopping short, \"I believe those three\\nyoung girls ride the bicycle. Now that I think of it, I\\'m sure I saw\\nthem whirl past the club yesterday morning. They wore natty navy blue\\nsuits and blue veils. I couldn\\'t see what their faces were like. Two\\nelderly gentlemen accompanied them.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, they ride the wheel,\" assented Ravenswood, reluctantly. \"The two\\ngentlemen were Mr. Ryder and Mr. Cramer, who are very enthusiastic over\\nthe sport. There\\'s a millionaire\\'s club of wheelmen here at Newport.\"\\n\\n\"I presume they will be at the fancy masquerade cycle tournament next\\nweek, then?\" said Ainsley, carelessly, though he listened anxiously for\\nthe reply.\\n\\n\"No doubt,\" returned Ravenswood. \"They were all at the last one. By the\\nway, it\\'s a very select affair. One has to be a member of the club, or\\nhave considerable outside influence, to secure tickets.\"\\n\\n\"Are you a member?\" asked Ainsley, quickly.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" returned Ravenswood. \"It was Hildegarde\\'s father who proposed my\\nname. I did not get even one black ball, and was consequently voted a\\nmember.\"\\n\\n\"Do you suppose, if you had been a poor devil of a clerk, instead of\\na millionaire\\'s son, you would have been voted in?\" asked Ainsley, a\\ntrifle bitterly, a hard light flashing into his eyes.\\n\\n\"Possibly not,\" replied Ravenswood, with a good-humored laugh.\\n\\n\"I should have thought you would have improved the opportunity of\\nseeing considerable of the Three Graces awheel,\" said Ainsley, after a\\nfew moments\\' pause.\\n\\n\"Their fathers discourage anything of that kind,\" laughed Philip; \"as\\nmore than one young man has found out.\"\\n\\n\"But Miss May\\'s relatives--do none of them ride?\"\\n\\n\"They are too old for that sort of thing,\" laughed Ravenswood. \"The old\\ngentleman is as deaf as a post, and is relegated to the hotel piazza\\nbecause of the gout. His wife is equally as deaf, and is too unwieldly\\nto venture far from her corner of the piazza. It is laughable to hear\\nthem shout at each other through their ear-trumpets. I have often\\nthought what a lonely life of it that beautiful young girl must have\\nwith those two old people. It would be unendurable, I fancy, if it were\\nnot for her two young friends.\"\\n\\n\"Probably they make up for not being companionable by not being so\\nstrict with their pretty prospective little heiress?\" suggested\\nAinsley, again listening eagerly for his friend\\'s reply.\\n\\n\"They certainly allow their granddaughter, or niece, whichever she is,\\nmore liberty than Hildegarde\\'s or Lily Ryder\\'s parents do. Still, I\\nsuppose they are confident that she can come to no harm, surrounded by\\nsuch careful friends and companions.\"\\n\\n\"Did you say, Philip, you were going to the fancy-dress masquerade\\ntournament?\" asked Royal Ainsley, slowly.\\n\\n\"I do not propose to miss it,\" responded Ravenswood.\\n\\n\"Do you think you can secure me a ticket, Phil?\" asked Ainsley,\\npoint-blank. \"Grant me that favor if you can. Remember, I ask it _as a\\ngreat favor_. Surely you can manage it somehow for me.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll try,\" replied Ravenswood. \"If it\\'s possible, you shall attend.\"\\n\\nDuring the next few days that followed, handsome Royal Ainsley saw as\\nmuch of the Three Graces as was possible. One day he was content with\\na bow or a smile--on the next, a few words in passing; but he was wise\\nenough to keep out of the way whenever their relatives were about.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III.\\n\\n\\nThe fancy-dress masquerade cycle carnival had been the talk of\\nfashionable circles in Newport for the last fortnight, and now, as the\\nauspicious evening drew near, excitement was almost at fever heat.\\n\\nThe tickets of admission had been closely guarded; gold could not buy\\nthem. The tickets, which were strictly _not transferable_, had been\\nduly delivered by messengers to the different members whose names they\\nbore, and the promoters of the affair felt duly satisfied that no one\\noutside the charmed circle of Newport\\'s fashionable Four Hundred could\\nby any possibility invade the sacred precincts.\\n\\nA whole army of officers were to guard against intruders. There was\\nto be a banquet in the supper-room at midnight, after the masks of\\nthe merry cyclers had been removed, that would be so startling in its\\nsumptuousness that the whole country would be talking about it, and\\nthose who had been fortunate enough to attend would never forget it in\\ntheir after lives.\\n\\nPhilip Ravenswood had indeed done his utmost to secure the admittance\\nof his friend; but even he had failed signally. The officers were\\ninexorable in their polite but firm refusal to his request.\\n\\nTwo hours later the grand masquerade cycle carnival was at its height.\\nThe marble walls of the millionaire club never held a more brilliant\\ngathering of ladies fair, with eyes behind silken masks brighter than\\nthe diamonds they wore, and men braver than the famous knights of old\\nin their powdered wigs, satin knee-breeches and spangled waistcoats.\\n\\nOne wheelman, in the costume of handsome Romeo, sprung from his wheel\\nnear one of the fountains, and watched with keen eyes through his mask\\nthe cyclers as they passed him one after another.\\n\\n\"Aha! I have them at last,\" he muttered, as he noted three wood-nymphs\\nhovering close together. \"Well, I declare, I thought I should have\\nlittle difficulty in distinguishing one from the other,\" he muttered;\\n\"but to save my life, I can not tell them apart. I shall trust to fate\\nto choose for me, hoping it will be the beauteous Hildegarde.\"\\n\\nSuddenly two plumed cavaliers sprung from their wheels before the two\\nforemost wood-nymphs, and asked permission in silent pantomime to ride\\nas their escorts around the rink, which request was graciously acceded\\nto, but with the dignity of young princesses.\\n\\n\"This is my opportunity,\" thought Romeo. \"I must claim the remaining\\nwood-nymph before some other fellow has the chance to capture her.\"\\n\\nThe next instant he was bowing low before her.\\n\\n\"May I have the great honor of riding as your escort around the rink,\\nfair wood-nymph?\" he whispered in a low, melodious voice. \"Ah, pardon\\nmy speaking; it was purely a slip of the tongue. I should have made\\nknown my request in pantomime. But pray forgive, and do not betray\\nme, fairest of all maidens, to the floor manager, pray, or I shall be\\nordered from the floor in deep disgrace.\"\\n\\n\"If she answers, I shall know by her voice which one of the three\\nheiresses she is,\" he thought.\\n\\n\"Oh, I shall not betray you, Mr. Ainsley,\" replied the girl, with a\\njolly little laugh, showing the whitest of pearly teeth, \"and I accept\\nyour escort to ride with me. I--I am so afraid of tumbling off my\\nwheel, this gay throng and the flashing lights bewilder me so. I--I was\\njust wondering if you would be here to-night.\"\\n\\n\"Fair maid, you know me?\" he whispered, in apparent amazement. \"I am\\nastounded, yet flattered. Pray be kind enough to exchange confidences.\\nI have been hoping against hope that _you_ are the one whom I longed to\\nsee here. Surely the throbbings of my heart tell me who you are, fair\\nnymph. Shall I breathe to you the name of her whom I ardently wish it\\nto be?\" he asked, softly.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" she answered, eagerly; and there was no mistaking the\\ncharacteristic catching of the breath, and the intense, eager gaze in\\nthe velvety eyes behind the silken mask.\\n\\nHe crushed the furtive hope that had stirred his heart for an instant\\nthat it might be Hildegarde, and answered, boldly:\\n\\n\"I prayed the fates to lead me to the feet of beauteous Ida May! Oh,\\ntell me--am I right? Do be kind, and tell me.\"\\n\\n\"Then the fates have answered your prayer,\" she replied. \"I suppose I\\nought _not_ to tell you until unmasking time, but really I can not help\\nit. I _am_ Ida May.\"\\n\\n\"Thanks, ten thousand thanks for ending my suspense, dear girl,\"\\nhe murmured, as only Royal Ainsley could utter the words. A few\\nsweeps around the rink, where handsome Romeo, with his superb fancy\\nriding, was the cynosure of all eager feminine eyes, midst murmurs\\nof admiration, then he whispered to his companion: \"Come into the\\nconservatory; the air is too close here. You are riding as though you\\nwere dizzy. Are you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" she answered. \"I _must_ have air. I----\"\\n\\nThe wheel suddenly wobbled recklessly from side to side, as though its\\nrider had lost control of it entirely.\\n\\nRoyal Ainsley sprung from his wheel just in time to prevent her from\\nfalling, and in that instant he crushed her closely to his heart, then\\nas quickly released her.\\n\\nThe excitement was so great, no one noticed this little by-play, or\\nsaw Romeo lead the fair wood-nymph from amid the glittering lights to\\nthe shadowy depths of the cool conservatory. Standing their wheels\\nagainst a marble Flora, he found a rustic bench on which he placed\\nher, taking a seat beside her, dangerously near, his hand closing over\\nthe fluttering little white one, his handsome head, with its fair,\\nclustering hair, bent near her own. A half hour they spent amid the\\ndim, cool shadows, the perfume of the roses enfolding them, the soft,\\nlow, bewildering echo of the delicious music floating out to them.\\n\\nRemember, the young girl was only seventeen, dear reader, otherwise the\\nplace, and the scene, and the fair, handsome lover by her side could\\nnot have infatuated her so quickly or so deeply.\\n\\n\"This is heaven!\" he whispered. \"How I wish we could linger here\\nforever, Ida--I your devoted knight, and you my queen, the world\\nforgetting, by the world forgot! Do _you_ wish it could be so?\"\\n\\nThe low cadence of his voice; the thrilling touch of that strong, white\\nhand that was stealing around the supple waist, drawing her toward\\nhim; the panting of his breath, which she could feel on her flushed\\ncheek; the mesmeric, steady gaze of those bright blue, shining eyes,\\nbewildered her--made her heart flutter as it had never fluttered\\nbefore.\\n\\n\"Do you wish we could be always together, Ida?\" he persisted.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" answered the girl, with a half sob of affright, trembling under\\nthe strange spell that had slowly but surely been cast over her.\\n\\n\"Then marry me, Ida!\" he cried, \"this very night--within the hour, and\\nno one can ever part us after that! Oh, Ida, do not refuse me!\" he\\nurged. \"I love you so that I would die for you. Fate surely intended us\\nfor each other, or we would never have met and loved as we do. Oh, my\\ndarling, you can not deny it! You do love me, Ida May?\"\\n\\nShe strove with all her might to deny it; but, in spite of herself,\\nhe wrung the truth from her lips--that she _did_ love him. A sudden\\nlight that she could not quite understand leaped up into his eyes for a\\nmoment, and a triumphant smile curved his lips.\\n\\n\"We shall be married to-night, Ida!\" he cried. \"I will arrange it\\nsomehow;\" and as he uttered the words, he told himself that the great\\nheiress was as good as won.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV.\\n\\n\\nThe crash of the music, the hum of voices, and the song of the rippling\\nfountains seemed to dazzle Ida May\\'s senses.\\n\\n\"Promise me that you will marry me, my darling!\" cried the impetuous\\nlover. \"Would it be so very difficult, Ida?\" he whispered.\\n\\nShe clung to him, the terror deepening in her eyes.\\n\\n\"This is a little romance all our own,\" he added, clasping her\\nclosely. \"Ida, let me kiss you!\" He clasped his arms around her and\\ndrew her to his breast. \"You are mine in life, mine in death, and mine\\nthrough all eternity!\"\\n\\nHe kissed the sweet lips over and over again.\\n\\nShe was so young that she believed him.\\n\\n\"Let us be married first, then we can talk over all these things\\nafter!\" he exclaimed, impetuously.\\n\\nShe was dazed by his passionate words.\\n\\nHe felt quite sure that this sweet, beautiful, dainty young girl could\\nnot hold out against him if he only persisted.\\n\\nOne more bold stroke, and the heiress would be his.\\n\\nThere would be a scene, he well knew, when he brought the young girl\\nback to the old folks. But it would surely end by their forgiving her.\\nThey could not hold out against her very long.\\n\\n\"You are--sure--it--it--would be right, Mr. Ainsley?\" she faltered.\\n\\n\"You must not call me \\'mister\\' sweet one,\" he cried. \"To you I shall\\nbe \\'Royal\\' from now on to eternity. Let me manage this affair, my\\ndarling,\" he added.\\n\\nAll power of resistance seemed swallowed up by his indomitable will.\\n\\n\"Go to the cloak-room, my love,\" he whispered, \"and change your attire\\nas quickly as you can. I will meet you at the fountain nearest the\\nentrance. Not one word to either of your friends, Ida,\" he said,\\nwarningly. \"Promise me that!\"\\n\\nThere was no crossing him. Indeed, the very power to even think for\\nherself seemed to have left her.\\n\\nLike one in a dream, Ida May donned her street clothes, the thought\\nfilling her mind of what Hildegarde and Lily would say when it was\\nunmasking time and they came to look for her. How startled they would\\nbe!\\n\\nOutside all was confusion. There was a great crush of carriages, the\\nbabble of coachmen and footmen, the crunching of wheels, and the\\ncalling of numbers. To the girl whom Royal Ainsley led on to so strange\\na fate it seemed like a dream. Some one followed with their wheels.\\nRoyal Ainsley took them from the man, and she saw him toss him several\\npieces of silver.\\n\\nHe did not tell her that he had written a note to an old minister,\\nliving two miles out of the village, asking him to remain at home to\\nmarry them. No name had been signed to the note; but he had argued to\\nhimself that the minister, who probably was sadly in need of making an\\nextra dollar, would stay at home to perform the ceremony. If his plans\\nmatured well, all well and good; if they miscarried, well, no one would\\nbe the wiser as to who sent the letter.\\n\\nHe assisted her to mount her wheel, and, as if in a dream, they went\\nspeeding down the boulevard.\\n\\n\"We must make quicker time, my darling,\" he said.\\n\\nWas it a sob he heard coming from the girl\\'s lips? Ida May seemed to\\nhave suddenly awakened to a sense of what she had done. A brief half\\nhour since she had been in the midst of a brilliant party, and now,\\nscarcely knowing how it had come about, she found herself flying with\\nthe handsome lover, whom she had known but a few short weeks, going she\\nknew not whither.\\n\\nThe awakening came to her like a terrible shock.\\n\\n\"Royal!\" she cried, \"oh, Royal, what have we done? Where are we going?\\nI did not mean to run away. I must have been mad. Let us go back\\nagain!\"\\n\\nAs she spoke, the great clock from some adjoining tower struck the hour\\nof twelve.\\n\\n\"We are too late,\" he said. \"We have burned our bridges behind us. They\\nare unmasking now, and they have missed you. They will soon institute a\\nsearch.\"\\n\\nShe clasped his arm.\\n\\n\"Oh, Royal! I must tell you all!\"\\n\\nThe hot, trembling hand clung to him, the lovely young face was full of\\nawful grief.\\n\\n\"My own darling!\" he cried, leaning over and rapturously embracing her,\\nthough in doing so he nearly caused her to fall from her wheel.\\n\\nSuddenly the heavens overhead seemed to darken, the wind to freshen,\\nand the booming of the waves, as they dashed heavily against the shore,\\nsounded dismally in the distance.\\n\\n\"We must make haste,\" said Royal Ainsley; \"there is a storm coming up.\\nI think we could save nearly half a mile by cutting across this field.\"\\n\\nHe swung open a gate opening out into a broad patch of land, and Ida\\nrode in.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V.\\n\\n\\n\"I see a light glimmering in a window a short distance away. I will\\ntake you there, and walk back to the village to get some kind of a\\nconveyance.\"\\n\\nIn a few moments they found themselves knocking for admission at the\\nlittle cottage from whence they had observed the light.\\n\\nHis impatient knock brought a white, terrified face to a window which\\nwas opened above.\\n\\n\"What do you want?\" asked a voice in unmistakable tones of fear.\\n\\n\"I must have shelter for this young lady for a little while,\" exclaimed\\nAinsley, impatiently; adding: \"I will pay you handsomely if you will\\nallow her to remain here an hour or two, until I can go for a carriage\\nfor her.\"\\n\\nThe window was closed quickly down again, and Royal heard some one say\\nquite distinctly:\\n\\n\"I tell you it is only a _ruse_. It is an officer of the law.\"\\n\\nAgain Royal knocked impatiently.\\n\\n\"It is commencing to rain,\" he called. \"For Heaven\\'s sake, open the\\ndoor quickly!\"\\n\\nDespite the sobs and protestations of the voice inside, a man opened\\nthe door and stepped out, confronting them. One hand held a lighted\\nlamp and the other rested upon his hip pocket.\\n\\nTo Royal Ainsley\\'s intense astonishment, he found that he was at the\\nsummer cottage of Newport\\'s haughty mayor.\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon,\" stammered the man, in dire confusion.\\n\\n\"It is rather late to awaken any one; but you have heard the words,\\n\\'any port in a storm\\'? The truth is, I want to find shelter for this\\nyoung lady until I can go for a conveyance to take her to a minister\\nwho is awaiting us to perform the marriage ceremony.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, that is it!\" exclaimed the mayor, with a look of relief coming\\nover his face. \"An elopement, eh?\"\\n\\n\"All is fair in love, you know,\" laughed the young man, leading Ida\\ninto the parlor, his host preceding them.\\n\\n\"Who are you, and who is the young lady?\" inquired the man.\\n\\nIt was Royal\\'s turn to hesitate now. If he found out that the young\\ngirl clinging to his arm was the heiress of the Mays, would he not\\nrefuse to perform the ceremony until they could be communicated with?\\n\\n\"I am Royal Ainsley,\" answered the young man, affecting not to hear the\\nlast part of the question; and Ida, thinking she was called upon to\\nspeak, responded, promptly:\\n\\n\"And I am Ida May, sir.\"\\n\\nThe mayor wheeled about quickly.\\n\\n\"What! Did I hear you say the name May? Are you the young girl stopping\\nat the Ocean House whom they call the niece of the Mays?\"\\n\\nThe girl was trembling so she could not answer.\\n\\n\"We might as well put a bold front on the matter,\" whispered Royal,\\nclasping quickly the ice-cold hands.\\n\\n\"She is, sir,\" he answered, with an air of assurance which he was far\\nfrom feeling.\\n\\nThe effect of his words upon his host was wonderful. An expression that\\nwas almost diabolical flashed over his face.\\n\\n\"Hold!\" he cried. \"You need look no further for a minister; I will\\nperform the ceremony. It is a pity for the young lady to have to go out\\nin the storm to have a little service like that rendered. Old May\\'s\\nniece!\" he muttered under his breath. \"Ah, what a glorious revenge it\\nis for me to give her to this profligate! Of course, old May don\\'t know\\nanything about the escapade of this girl!\"\\n\\nHe clinched his hands tightly together as he looked at her. There was\\nno feature of old John May perceptible in this slender little creature;\\nbut for all that, he hated her--ay, he hated her with a deadly hatred.\\n_He knew why._\\n\\n\"I will help you in this affair,\" he said, with a peculiar laugh that\\nmight mean much or might mean little.\\n\\nThe ceremony was not a long one, and almost before Ida could realize\\nwhat was taking place, Royal Ainsley was bending over her, and calling\\nher his dear little wife. But there was something about the kiss that\\nhe laid on her lips that made a strange shiver creep over her.\\n\\nRoyal Ainsley could hardly conceal his triumph. No matter if the Mays\\ndid find her now, they could not undo what had been done. He had wedded\\nher and her millions!\\n\\n\"Is there a train that leaves for New York?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"Yes; one passes here in about twenty minutes from now. By cutting\\nacross over to that side road you could easily catch it.\"\\n\\nHalf an hour later, they were steaming toward the city as fast as steam\\ncould carry them. The dark curly head nestled against his shoulder,\\nwhile Royal looked out of the window, out into the blackness of the\\nnight, little dreaming that he was on the eve of a terrible tragedy.\\n\\nHe had been lucky enough to secure the little compartment at the rear\\nof the drawing-room car, which those who have money enough to pay for\\ncan secure exclusively for themselves.\\n\\n\"I ought to tell you something that is weighing very heavily upon my\\nmind, Royal,\" she said, nestling closer to her fair, handsome, boyish\\nhusband.\\n\\n\"Not until to-morrow, love,\" he declared, drawing her toward him, and\\nkissing her fondly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI.\\n\\n\\nIt was early the next morning when the Newport express steamed into the\\nGrand Central Depot.\\n\\nRoyal Ainsley cast a furtive glance around him as he stepped upon the\\nplatform. He had quite expected a dozen or more detectives to spring\\nforward, for, of course, the telegraph wires had been busy during the\\nnight.\\n\\nThey would no doubt be waiting to arrest him for abducting the heiress.\\nBut when he had blandly informed them that lovely Ida May was his wife,\\nwhat could they do but fall back abashed and disconcerted.\\n\\nTo his great surprise, he seemed to create no sensation whatever. No\\none even noticed him as he joined the throng, with Ida May clinging\\ntightly to his arm.\\n\\n\"I will give them some little trouble to find us,\" he thought to\\nhimself.\\n\\nHe knew of a quiet, aristocratic family hotel facing the park, and\\nplacing Ida in a carriage, he took a seat beside her, and directed the\\ndriver to proceed as quickly as possible to the place indicated.\\n\\nWhirling through the streets of gay New York was quite a sensation to\\nIda, who had never been outside of her own country village, save for\\nthat fateful trip to Newport.\\n\\nWith Royal clasping her two little fluttering hands in one of his\\nstrong white ones, his left arm holding her close as the cab rattled\\nup Broadway, her fear of the noise, the great rush of people hurrying\\nhither and thither, and the great crush of vehicles that threatened to\\ndemolish them every moment, gradually subsided as they rode along.\\n\\nThey reached their destination, and a moment more were ushered into the\\nlittle white-and-gold parlor.\\n\\n\"We will have the best breakfast that they can prepare,\" said Royal,\\n\"and then I shall take you to see the sights of the city.\"\\n\\nHe was obliged to take the hotel clerk into his confidence.\\n\\n\"It\\'s an elopement,\" he whispered in the clerk\\'s ear. \"My bride is the\\nheiress of the wealthy Mays, of Boston. There may be a deuce of a row\\nwhen they trace us to this place, but it will end all right by the\\nfatted calf being killed for us. But as for the breakfast, how long\\nwill it take to prepare it?\"\\n\\n\"Not more than fifteen minutes,\" returned the clerk, with an obsequious\\nbow. \"We will send up to the parlor, and let you know when it is\\nready,\" he added.\\n\\nHe turned away with a royal air. Already he felt as if the May millions\\nwere in his pocket, that he was a man to be envied, that he was of\\ngreat importance.\\n\\nRoyal Ainsley immediately joined Ida in the parlor. He found her\\nensconced in one of the large velvet easy-chairs, looking out of the\\nwindow, with something very like fright in her great dark eyes.\\n\\n\"Oh, Royal, are you sure it is quite right?\" she sobbed. \"Did you want\\nme to marry you so very much?\"\\n\\n\"What a silly little girl you are!\" he cried, impetuously. \"Of course,\\nI want you. I could not live without you. I know you must be very\\nhungry, as well as tired from loss of sleep. Come over to this sofa and\\nsit down, and we will talk over our plans.\"\\n\\n\"Royal,\" she whispered, clasping his hands closer, \"you would not\\nlisten to me when I tried to tell you something in the conservatory;\\nbut you must listen to me now. I can not be quite happy, dear, until\\nyou know all. I--I have a confession to make.\"\\n\\nHe looked at her blankly.\\n\\n\"What odd words you use, my darling Ida!\" he said. \"A confession! I do\\nnot like to hear you use such an expression. I hope that there is no\\nother lover in the background?\"\\n\\n\"It is not a lover!\" she cried, clinging to him. \"I have never loved\\nany one else but you!\"\\n\\n\"Then it is all right, my angel!\" he cried, brightly, gathering her\\nclosely to him, despite the fact that people were passing in the\\ncorridor outside, and had a full view of all that was taking place\\nwithin the room. She struggled out of his arms, blushing like a peony,\\neven though she was his bride.\\n\\n\"Sit opposite me, where I can see you, and it will not be so hard to\\ntell you _all_,\" sobbed Ida, faintly.\\n\\nHe complied with her wishes.\\n\\n\"Cut the story as short as possible, dear,\" he said, \"or you will be\\nobliged to have it continued in our next, as breakfast will soon be\\nready.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, how shall I tell you the truth, Royal!\" she said, distressedly.\\n\"Perhaps you won\\'t smile so when you know all, and--and--you might even\\nhate me.\"\\n\\n\"No matter what the little story is that you have to tell me, my\\ndarling, I will love you better than ever.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Royal, are you sure of it?\" she cried, with that frightened look\\nwhich puzzled him so.\\n\\n\"Yes; I give you my word beforehand, that, no matter what you have to\\ntell me, I will love you all the more!\"\\n\\n\"I will tell you all, then, and throw myself on your mercy to forgive\\nme for the past,\" she sobbed. \"Hold my hands, Royal, closely in your\\nown, while I tell you all of the pitiful past, from beginning to end;\\nand then, Royal, you shall kiss my tears away, even--oh, Heaven, pity\\nme!--though I have sinned beyond pardon!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII.\\n\\n\\nLittle dreaming of the purport of the story Ida had to tell, Royal\\nAinsley drew near. For a moment, Ida May\\'s great somber eyes looked\\ninto his as though she would read his very soul.\\n\\n\"Tell me over again that you will forgive me, no matter what it is that\\nI have to tell you.\"\\n\\n\"I have already given you that promise over and over again,\" he\\ndeclared. \"Surely you don\\'t want me to take an oath to that effect?\"\\n\\n\"Not if your solemn promise is strong enough to bind you.\"\\n\\n\"You forget that you are wasting time, Ida?\" he said, good-humoredly.\\n\\n\"It will not take me long to tell my sad little story,\" she answered,\\nwith a half sob; \"and oh, what a world of comfort it will be for me to\\nknow that you will care for me, no matter what the world may think.\\nWhen you hear my story you will understand the great temptation, and\\nwill not judge me too cruelly.\\n\\n\"To begin with, my mother and I lived with a very wealthy family in\\nDorchester. My mother was housekeeper, and I--well, I had no regular\\nposition there, until, owing to the meager salary they paid my mother,\\nI was compelled to learn telegraphy, and found a position at the\\nstation. To gain my mother\\'s consent to do this was extremely hard.\\n\\n\"\\'They will not be pleased, Ida,\\' she said, piteously.\\n\\n\"\\'What do the Deerings care for you or me?\\' I answered, bitterly. \\'Only\\nto make you toil year in and year out for a pittance so meager that it\\nscarcely keeps body and soul together!\\'\\n\\n\"\\'But they allow me to keep you with me, my dear child. That is\\neverything to a mother who is poor,\\' she sighed.\\n\\n\"\\'I am not a child any longer,\\' I cried. \\'I am quite sixteen. I must be\\nmaking money now, if ever, to help you!\\'\\n\\n\"\\'But what can you do?\\' she asked.\\n\\n\"When I told her my plans, she looked at me dubiously.\\n\\n\"\\'Surely Mrs. Deering would not object,\\' I declared.\\n\\n\"But she did object. To my surprise she flew into a terrible rage when\\nI summoned courage enough to go to the morning-room the next day and\\nasked to speak to her.\\n\\n\"I unfolded to the cold, proud woman my plans to make a living. She did\\nnot wait to hear me through, but flew into such a passion of rage that\\nI drew back in terror.\\n\\n\"\\'I have different plans for you entirely, Ida May,\\' she said. \\'Go to\\nyour mother. I told her my plans scarcely half an hour ago. She will\\nunfold them to you. Mind, they must be carried out by you, or your\\nmother and you will suffer. Your father owed us a sum of money before\\nhe died, and during the past years your mother has worked to pay us\\noff. Over one-half yet remains to be paid. Your mother\\'s name is signed\\nto your father\\'s notes of indebtedness, and she is responsible for\\nthem. If I pressed for payment and she could not pay, she could be\\nthrown into a debtor\\'s prison.\\'\\n\\n\"I sobbed aloud in my terror: \\'Oh, Mrs. Deering, if this indeed be\\ntrue, there is more need than ever for me to earn money to pay off my\\nmother\\'s debts.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'There is another way in which you can pay them off,\\' she answered.\\n\\n\"\\'Oh, how?\\' I cried, falling on my knees and clasping my hands.\\n\\n\"The answer came like a crash of thunder from a clear sky.\\n\\n\"\\'By marrying my nephew,\\' she said, harshly.\\n\\n\"I sprung to my feet in terror. Marry any one! I, who was only a child!\\n\\n\"\\'My mother would not consent to anything like that, even----\\'\\n\\n\"\\'She will be forced to consent!\\' was the harsh reply. \\'My nephew will\\nbe here in a week.\\'\\n\\n\"I found my mother walking her room, wringing her hands and tearing her\\nhair. Her excitement was so great that for a moment I was terrified.\\n\\n\"\\'Has she told you all, Ida?\\' she asked, in terror.\\n\\n\"\\'Yes, mother,\\' I answered.\\n\\n\"\\'And did she tell you what this nephew of hers was like?\\'\\n\\n\"\\'No,\\' I replied, greatly puzzled by her manner.\\n\\n\"She shuddered as with a terrible chill.\\n\\n\"\\'Listen, Ida,\\' she said, in a strained, awful voice: \\'Her nephew is\\nsuch a horrid creature, that to be hated he needs but to be seen. He is\\na hunchback--and--an idiot--has a touch of insanity about him. Except\\nthe first few years of his life, he has been confined in an asylum.\\nThis nephew has a bachelor uncle, who has declared his intention\\nto make the young man his heir if he marries when he is twenty-one.\\nOtherwise the great fortune goes to another branch of the family. They\\nwould make a victim of you, wreck your beautiful young life for their\\nown ambitious aims. It will be six months before he is of age. But the\\nmarriage shall never be, my darling. Your young life shall never be\\nsacrificed by these inhuman Shylocks. When the hour comes, we will die\\ntogether.\\'\\n\\n\"One day my mother met me with a white, awful face.\\n\\n\"\\'Mrs. Deering\\'s nephew has arrived with a valet!\\' she cried, under her\\nbreath.\\n\\n\"\\'But the six months are not up, mother,\" I cried. \\'It wants a\\nfortnight to that time.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'He has come to stay until you make your decision.\\'\\n\\n\"Oh, God! the horror of it! Death a thousand times over would have been\\npreferable to that.\\n\\n\"How could I stand at the altar and promise to obey a creature the very\\nsight of whom filled me with disgust and terror?\\n\\n\"I fled through the village, not daring to look behind me, and never\\nstopping until I reached the telegraph office.\\n\\n\"It was little wonder that I made strange mistakes during the hour that\\nfollowed.\\n\\n\"It was during this time that Mrs. May stepped up to the window and\\ncalled for a blank.\\n\\n\"Although her name was the same as mine, yet we were in no way related\\nto each other. They were wealthy people from Boston, I had heard, and\\nwere summering in the village.\\n\\n\"Without waiting to see the message sent, the lady hurried out of the\\noffice. A great sigh broke from my lips as I noted the well-filled\\npurse that she carried, the magnificent diamonds she wore on her hands,\\nand which swung sparkling from her ears. Any one of the gems she wore\\nwould have been a fortune to a poor girl like me.\\n\\n\"As she crossed the railway track in the direction of the post office,\\nshe must have seen the train bearing down upon her from around the\\ncurve of the road.\\n\\n\"However, she fainted away from fright, and lay directly on the track.\\nI had seen it all from my window, and I sprung to her rescue and\\ndragged her by main force from the track just in time to save her from\\ndestruction, as the ponderous locomotive just then thundered by. Mrs.\\nMay\\'s gratitude was great when she recovered consciousness.\\n\\n\"\\'How shall I ever reward you, my good girl?\\' she cried.\\n\\n\"\\'I need no reward,\\' I answered. \\'I would have done that for any one!\\'\\n\\n\"\\'You must be rewarded,\\' she declared. \\'My husband is coming from\\nBoston to-night, and he will insist upon doing handsomely by you.\\'\\n\\n\"I was living at home with my poor old mother, and when I went home\\nthat evening and told her the story, she wept like a child.\\n\\n\"\\'You did a noble action, Ida,\\' she said; adding slowly: \\'The Mays\\nare very rich. I should not be surprised if they made you a handsome\\npresent. I once knew a gentleman who gave a lad twenty-five dollars for\\nsaving his son from drowning. Perhaps they may do as well by you.\\'\\n\\n\"You see, we were very poor--mother and I--and twenty-five dollars\\nseemed a great deal to us.\\n\\n\"\\'How much good we could do with that sum,\\' my mother said. \\'We could\\nget a little ahead in our rent, and spare enough out of it to get a new\\ndress for you.\\'\\n\\n\"I clasped my hands. A new dress! Oh, surely it would be madness to\\nhope for such a thing!\\n\\n\"That evening Mrs. May sent for me to come to the grand cottage where\\nshe was stopping. Her husband, a very deaf old gentleman, sat at\\nthe window as I entered. They both thanked me in the most eager and\\ngrateful fashion.\\n\\n\"\\'We have been thinking the matter over,\\' said Mrs. May, \\'and I have\\ncome to the conclusion that I will do something handsome for you--give\\nyou a pleasure such as you have never experienced in your young life.\\'\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII.\\n\\n\\n\"Mrs. May paused and looked smilingly at me for a moment or two.\\n\\n\"\\'So great is the treat I have in store for you that you will never\\nforget it. But Mr. May and I disagree slightly as to what it shall be.\\nWe now lay the proposition before you. Which would you prefer--have\\nfive hundred dollars in cash, or be taken to Newport for a season, have\\nlovely dresses, and stop at a great hotel, under _my_ protection, and\\nhave as fine a time as any young girl at the sea-shore?\\'\\n\\n\"I cried aloud in the exuberance of my joy. I had read of the lives of\\nother young girls at the sea-shore, and this opportunity seemed like\\nthe opening out of fairy-land to me. You will not blame me, Royal;\\nI was young and romantic. I had never seen anything of life or its\\npleasures. A season at Newport! The very thought of it fairly took away\\nmy breath.\\n\\n\"\\'Oh, I will go to Newport!\\' I cried. \\'Then the great dream of my life\\nwill be realized!\\'\\n\\n\"\\'My husband thought you would prefer the money, but I knew that you\\nwould prefer the pleasure.\\'\\n\\n\"Half wild with joy, I went home and told my mother the wonderful news.\\nShe shook her head sadly.\\n\\n\"\\'We are so poor, you should have chosen the money, Ida,\\' she sobbed.\\n\\'Such a great gift is offered you but once in a life-time!\\'\\n\\n\"\\'But what does Mrs. May want you to do for her, Ida? Are you to be her\\nmaid?\\'\\n\\n\"\\'Oh, no, mother!\\' I cried, with a hysterical laugh. \\'I am to be a\\nreal lady, wear fine clothes, and sit on the porch reading novels, or\\npromenade on the sea-shore, from the time I get up in the morning till\\nI retire at night. I shall have pin-money, too, they say, and that I\\nwill send home to you. So everything will go on with you while I am\\naway as it did while I was here.\\'\\n\\n\"We had never been parted from each other, mother and I, and oh! it\\nwrung her heart to say \\'Yes.\\'\\n\\n\"But after much pleading on my part she consented to let me go. She\\nmade one proviso, however, and that was--I was not to fall in love with\\nany one whom I might meet.\\n\\n\"Oh, I can not tell you of my delight when I saw the wonderful dresses\\nthat Mrs. May purchased for me, saying that they were all my own\\nforever after. She took me to Newport with her. As my name was the same\\nas theirs, every one took it for granted that I was a niece of theirs,\\ninstead of their _protegee_ for a few short weeks, a report which the\\nMays did not trouble themselves to contradict.\"\\n\\nShe had told her story hastily, impetuously, not daring to look into\\nher lover\\'s face until she had concluded. Then she raised her great\\ndark eyes slowly. But what she saw in her husband\\'s face made her cry\\nout in terror.\\n\\n\"Oh, Royal! Royal! what is the matter?\" she cried, in alarm.\\n\\nHe sat before her as though he were petrified. The glassy, horrified\\nstare in his eyes cut to her heart like the thrust of a sword.\\n\\n\"I married you for love. You have helped me to escape Mrs. Deering\\'s\\ndreaded nephew,\" she faltered.\\n\\nBy a wonderful effort he found his voice.\\n\\n\"Not the heiress of the Mays!\" he cried, hoarsely, as though he was\\nunable to realize the truth.\\n\\n\"You do not love me the less for what I have done, do you?\" she cried,\\ncatching her breath with a sharp sob.\\n\\nBefore he could find words to answer, breakfast was announced.\\n\\n\"Go in and eat your breakfast, Ida,\" he said. \"I have some important\\nmatters which I must attend to that will keep me busy for the next hour\\nto come. Don\\'t wait for me. Lie down and rest until you hear from me.\\nYou will need all your strength to meet that which is before you.\" And\\nhis brows darkened ominously.\\n\\nShe was young, and youth has an appetite all its own. She was very\\ntired with all she had gone through the last few hours, and the\\nappetizing breakfast spread before her caused her to forget everything\\nelse.\\n\\nLike all young, healthy girls, she ate heartily; then she rose from the\\ntable and re-entered the little parlor to wait for the coming of Royal\\nto ask him to send a telegram to her mother.\\n\\n\"Shall I show you to your room, miss?\" asked the waiter.\\n\\n\"No,\" she answered. \"I will wait here.\"\\n\\n\"Then here is a letter which has just been handed me to give to you.\"\\n\\nShe opened it, and found that it was from Royal.\\n\\nFor one moment Ida May looked with an expression of puzzled wonder at\\nthe letter which the hotel waiter had handed her.\\n\\nIt was in Royal\\'s handwriting; she saw that at once.\\n\\nWhat could he write to her about, when he had been away from her\\nscarcely an hour? He probably wished to remind her to be sure to be\\nready when he arrived.\\n\\n\"How he loves me!\" she murmured, a pink flush stealing into the dimpled\\ncheeks. \"What a happy girl I ought to be that my lover loves me so\\nwell!\"\\n\\nThe waiter had gone back to attend to his duty. She saw that she was\\nalone, and with a quick action she raised the envelope to her lips with\\nher little white hands and kissed it--ay, kissed passionately the sword\\nwhich was to slay her the next moment.\\n\\nSeating herself in a cozy arm-chair close by the open window, Ida\\nMay opened the letter which was to be her death-warrant, and read as\\nfollows:\\n\\n \"IDA, I suppose the contents of this note will give you something of\\n a shock; but it is best to know the truth now than later on. I shall\\n come to the point at once, that you may not be kept in suspense.\\n\\n \"The truth is, Ida, that your confession has knocked all our little\\n plans on the head. To write plainly, when I thoughtlessly married\\n you, it was under the impression that you were the niece of the\\n Mays--their future heiress. I have not told you much about myself in\\n the past, but I am obliged to do so now.\\n\\n \"I am not at all a rich fellow. I am working along as best I can,\\n living on what people call wits--and expectations, which make me a\\n veritable slave to the whims of a capricious old aunt and uncle.\\n\\n \"They have decided that I must marry a girl who has money. I would\\n not dare to present a portionless bride to them. In such a case, all\\n my future prospects would be ruined. I must add that I have a still\\n greater surprise for you. On leaving you, I purchased this morning\\'s\\n paper, and the first item that met my eye was the absconding of the\\n man who performed the ceremony for us last night. It appears that he\\n was turned out of office some two days before, impeached, as it were,\\n for embezzling money.\\n\\n \"All power was taken from him to act in the capacity of mayor. Thus\\n the ceremony which we thought made us one is not binding. You are free\\n as air. No one will be any the wiser, and you are none the worse for\\n our little escapade--romance--call it what you will.\\n\\n \"A little affair in the life of a telegraph operator will not set the\\n heart of the great world throbbing with excitement. I am sorry affairs\\n have turned out this way; for, upon my word, I could have liked you.\\n There is but one thing to do under the circumstances; that is, to part\\n company. I advise you to go quietly back and marry the rich lover Mrs.\\n Deering has selected for you. That will be better than drudging your\\n life away in a telegraph office.\\n\\n \"This is all I have to say, and thus I take French leave of you.\\n Forget me as quickly as you can, little girl. I am nearly dead broke,\\n but I am generous enough to share what money I have with you. Inclosed\\n you will find a twenty-dollar bill--quite enough to take you back to\\n the village which you should never have left. Yours in great haste,\\n\\n     \"\\'ROYAL.\\'\"\\n\\nOnce, twice, thrice--ay, a dozen times--the girl read the heartless\\nletter through until every word was scorched into her brain in letters\\nof fire, then it fluttered from her hands to the floor.\\n\\nShe sat quite still, like one petrified by a sudden awful horror; then\\ncreeping to the window, she raised the sash, and, looking up into God\\'s\\nface through the glinting sunshine, asked the angels in Heaven to\\ntell her if it was true that the husband she had but just wedded had\\ndeserted her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX.\\n\\n\\nAgain the poor child picked up the cruel letter; but she could not read\\na line of it, though she sat looking at the written page.\\n\\n\"Not his wife!\" she moaned over and over again, clutching her little\\nhands over her heart.\\n\\nWith a sudden frenzy she tore the letter into a thousand shreds, and\\nflung the pieces from her through the open window.\\n\\nWould her poor, sick mother\\'s heart break when she told her all? When\\nshe went home, would they force her to marry the terrible being she\\nabhorred?\\n\\nHome! Ah, God! what a mockery! She had only a shelter. If she refused\\nto marry the horrible hunchback, her mother and herself would not even\\nhave that.\\n\\nHow could she face the future? The very thought of it made the blood\\nchill in her veins.\\n\\n\"Oh, Royal! Royal! death from your hands would have been easier than\\nthat!\" she moaned.\\n\\nThe next moment there was a heavy fall, and one of the house-maids,\\npassing the parlor, saw the girl lying in a heap.\\n\\nThey did all in their power to restore her to consciousness; but it\\nwas quite useless. When they had worked an hour over her, they became\\nalarmed.\\n\\nWhere was her husband? Why did he not return? The hotel physician did\\nall in his power, but without avail.\\n\\n\"It looks like a case of brain fever,\" he said, \"or perhaps typhoid.\\nEither is contagious, therefore dangerous. I should advise that she be\\nsent to the hospital around the corner.\"\\n\\n\"That husband of hers has not settled his bill!\" exclaimed the\\nproprietor, his face darkening angrily.\\n\\n\"It is _my_ opinion,\" said the doctor, \"that it is best not to await\\nthe return of the young gentleman who accompanied her here. In short,\\nit is my opinion that he has deserted her.\"\\n\\nIn less time than it takes to tell it, poor, hapless Ida May, the\\nvictim of such a cruel misfortune, and a sadder fate yet to follow, was\\ntaken to the hospital. The waning summer days drifted slowly by, and\\nautumn came with its dead, rustling leaves and sobbing winds, before\\nIda May opened her eyes to consciousness and turned them full upon the\\nwhite-capped nurse bending over her.\\n\\n\"Where is Royal?\" she asked, faintly.\\n\\n\"You mean the young man who left you at the hotel?\" queried the nurse,\\nwho had heard the young girl\\'s sad story; adding: \"He never came back\\nto inquire for you. He has deserted you. He did not care whether or not\\nthe shock would kill you. If there was ever a heartless scoundrel on\\nthe face of the earth, he is that one!\"\\n\\nThe lovely white young face never changed its pallor, the dark eyes\\nnever left the grim countenance of the nurse.\\n\\n\"I want to leave this place at once,\" said the girl, attempting to rise\\nfrom her cot.\\n\\n\"No, no; you must not do so!\" exclaimed the nurse. \"It would be\\ndangerous in your case.\"\\n\\n\"But I want my mother,\" moaned Ida, piteously.\\n\\nWhen the nurse made her rounds an hour later, to her great\\nconsternation she found that Cot 27 was empty. The girl had flown! The\\nmost diligent search through the city failed to elicit the slightest\\ntrace of her whereabouts.\\n\\nAn hour later a little dark figure, ensconced in a corner of the car,\\nwas whirling rapidly toward Dorchester.\\n\\nShe sat staring from the window with eyes that did not see so intent\\nwas she with her own thoughts.\\n\\n\"I can not marry Mrs. Deering\\'s nephew,\" she sobbed, under her breath.\\n\"It would be easier for me to die. But what shall I do to raise the\\nmoney for which they hold my poor mother a veritable slave!\"\\n\\nShe clasped her hands in piteous entreaty; but the soft, radiant moon\\nand the golden stars to which she raised her eyes so appealingly could\\nfind no answer for her.\\n\\nAs the train slowed up at the station, she pulled her veil down\\nclosely. She hurriedly alighted and sped like a storm-driven swallow\\nup the village street and along the high-road, until, almost out of\\nbreath, she reached the Deerings\\' mansion. She stood transfixed for a\\nmoment at the gate.\\n\\nWhat was there about the place that caused such a shudder to creep over\\nher? What did the awful presentiment, as of coming evil, mean that took\\npossession of her body and soul?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X.\\n\\n\\nHow weird the place looked, how gaunt and bare the great oak-trees\\nlooked, looming up darkly against the moonlit sky! The dead leaves\\nrustled across her path as she crept around to the rear door.\\n\\nShe looked up at her mother\\'s window, and another great chill crept\\nover her. All was dark there. It had always been her mother\\'s custom\\nto place her lamp on the broad window-sill at night. Many a time it\\nhad been her beacon-light in cutting across lots from the station on\\nevenings when she had been detained by her work. How strange it was\\nthat the light was not in the window to-night!\\n\\n\"Mother is not expecting me to-night,\" she said to herself, \"that is\\nthe reason it is not there.\"\\n\\nBut ah, how she missed it! How her heart had yearned to behold it, with\\na yearning so great that it had been the most intense pain. She lifted\\nthe latch and entered tremblingly, hesitatingly. It had been over two\\nmonths since her mother had heard from her. How had her patient,\\nsuffering mother lived through it?\\n\\nAs she crossed the hall she heard the sound of Mrs. Deering\\'s voice in\\na sharp, high key. Perhaps the horrible nephew was with her. She paused\\nin a paroxysm of terror. She was talking to her husband, scolding him,\\nrather.\\n\\n\"It isn\\'t _my_ fault that we lost the fortune,\" he was answering her\\nmeekly. \"You brought your nephew out of the asylum too soon. You knew\\nhe would not be here a fortnight before he would do some terrible\\ndeed--burn the house down over our heads, or kill himself when the\\nattendant was not watching, or some other horrible deed of that kind.\\nWhen he did succeed in mutilating himself before any of us was aware\\nof it, instead of sending him back to the asylum, to be cared for, you\\nkept him here under lock and key thinking to cure him yourself in a\\ncouple of months or so.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" thought Ida May, leaning faint and dizzy against the wall, \"now\\nI understand why Mrs. Deering consented to let me go away. Anything to\\nget me out of the house while she was curing the insane nephew whom she\\nhad vowed I must wed.\"\\n\\nThe next words, while they shocked her inexpressively, lifted a world\\nof woe from her heart.\\n\\n\"Well, despite our watchfulness, he succeeded in killing himself at\\nlast; so there\\'s the end of it. The fortune is lost, and there\\'s no use\\nin raving over it, and in venting your bitter wrath upon everything and\\nevery one that comes within your range.\"\\n\\nMrs. Deering\\'s anger was so great that she could not utter a word. She\\nflung open the door and dashed into the hall. The very first object\\nthat met her gaze was the cowering little figure leaning against the\\nbalustrade.\\n\\n\"You!\" she cried, quite as soon as she could catch her breath. \"How\\ndare you come here, Ida May, you wicked girl! I am amazed that you have\\nthe effrontery to face honest people after what you have done! We read\\nall about it in the newspapers--how you ran away from Newport with a\\ngay, dashing fellow who soon after deserted you. Don\\'t attempt to tell\\nme anything about it. I won\\'t listen to a word. Get out of this house\\nas quick as you can! Go, before I bid the servants throw you from the\\nhouse!\"\\n\\n\"But my mother! Surely you will let me see my mother!\" sobbed the\\ngirl, piteously. \"The whole wide world may be against me, but she will\\nbelieve me guiltless! _Please_ let me see her.\"\\n\\nA laugh that was horrible to hear broke from Mrs. Deering\\'s thin lips.\\n\\n\"Your mother!\" she sneered; \"much you cared about her, or how your\\ndoings affected her. That article in the newspapers did the work, as\\nyou might have known it would. I carried the paper to her myself, and\\nwhen she read it she fell to the floor with a bitter cry, and she never\\nspoke again. It was her death-warrant!\"\\n\\nFor one moment the girl looked at the woman with frightened eyes, as\\nthough she could not quite comprehend the full import of what the woman\\nwas saying.\\n\\n\"It killed your mother!\" she repeated pitilessly. \"You might have known\\nit would. She died of a broken heart!\"\\n\\nA long, low moan came from the girl\\'s lips. The awful despair in the\\ndark eyes would have touched any other heart, even though it were made\\nof stone; but in Mrs. Deering\\'s heart there was neither pity nor mercy.\\n\\n\"Go!\" she repeated, threateningly, \"and do not dare to ever darken my\\ndoor again!\"\\n\\n\"Will you tell me where you have buried my poor mother?\" moaned Ida\\nMay, with bitter anguish.\\n\\n\"In the lot where the poor of the village are put,\" she answered,\\nunfeelingly. \"We had to have a mark put over her. You can easily find\\nit. It\\'s to the left-hand corner, the last one on the row. It would be\\nbetter for you, you shameless girl, if you were lying beside her rather\\nthan sink to the lowest depths of the road you are traveling. Go--go at\\nonce!\"\\n\\nWith trembling feet she crept down the broad path and out of the gate.\\nShe was drenched to the skin, and the chill October winds pierced\\nthrough her thin wet clothes like the sharp cut of a knife. It did not\\nmatter much; nothing mattered for her any more. She was going to find\\nher mother\\'s grave, kneel down beside it, lay her tired head on the\\nlittle green mound, and wait there for death to come to her, for surely\\nGod would grant her prayer and in pity reach out His hand to her and\\ntake her home. There would be a home _there_ where her mother was, even\\nif all other doors were closed to her.\\n\\nShe had little difficulty in finding the place--a small inclosure in\\nthe rear of the old church that had fallen into decay and crumbling\\nruins many years ago--and by the blinding flashes of lightning, she\\nfound the grave of her mother--her poor, suffering mother, the only\\nbeing who had ever loved her in the great, cold, desolate earth.\\n\\n\"Mother,\" she sobbed, laying her face on the cold, wet leaves that\\ncovered the mound, \"mother, I have come to you to die. The world has\\ngone all wrong with me. I never meant to go wrong. I do not know how it\\nhappened. Other young girls have married the lovers whom they thought\\nGod had sent to them, and lived happy enough lives. I built such\\nglorious air-castles of the home I should have, the handsome, strong\\nyoung husband to love and to labor for me, and how you should live with\\nme, mother, never having to work any more. But oh, mother, all my plans\\nwent wrong! I don\\'t know why.\"\\n\\nIda May crouched there among the sleeping dead, her brain in a whirl;\\nand the long night wore on. The storm subsided, the wind died away over\\nthe tossing trees and the far-off hills, and the rain ceased. Morning\\nbroke faint and gray in the eastern sky, and the flecks of crimson\\nalong the horizon presaged a bright and gladsome day.\\n\\nThe station-agent, hurrying along to his duties at that early hour,\\nwas startled to see a dark figure lying among the graves. In a moment\\nhe was bending over the prostrate form. He could not distinguish in\\nthe dim light whose grave it was upon which the poor creature was\\nlying, but as he lifted the slender figure, and the faint, early light\\nfell upon the white, beautiful young face, he started back with an\\nexclamation of horror.\\n\\n\"Great God! it is little Ida May!\"\\n\\nFor an instant he was incapable of action, his surprise was so intense.\\n\\n\"Dead!\" he muttered, cold drops of perspiration standing out like beads\\non his perturbed brow. \"Little Ida May dead on her mother\\'s grave!\\nGod, how pitiful! She was so young to die!\"\\n\\nThen he knelt down beside her in the thick, wet grass, and placed his\\nhand over her heart in the wild hope that a spark of life might yet be\\nthere.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI.\\n\\n\\nWith bated breath, Hugh Rowland, the station-agent, knelt down in the\\ndew-wet grass, and placed his hand over the girl\\'s heart. Although the\\nsweet white face upturned to the gray morning light was as white as\\ndeath, he cried out sharply to himself: \"Her heart still beats! God be\\npraised! There is life in her yet!\"\\n\\nGathering her in his arms, as though she were a little child, he\\ncarried her quickly across lots to the station, and placed her upon a\\nrude bench. Once there, he could control himself no longer. He dropped\\nupon his knees beside her, burying his face in the folds of her wet\\ndress, chafing her hands, and sobbing as though his heart would break.\\n\\nHe had loved the girl lying there so stark and motionless as he had\\nnever loved anything in his life before; but he had never dared to tell\\nher of it. Though he was station-agent, and she a telegraph operator,\\nshe seemed as far above him as the star is from the earth.\\n\\nFor a moment Hugh Rowland had almost lost control of himself; then he\\nremembered how horribly cold she was, and he had the presence of mind\\nto start a fire in the big stove that always stood in the center of the\\nwaiting-room.\\n\\nThe grateful heat that rose from it quickly brought the breath of life\\nto the girl\\'s white lips. The great, dark, somber eyes opened wide, and\\nshe saw the rugged, kindly face of the young station-agent bending over\\nher.\\n\\n\"I found you--you had fainted in the graveyard,\" he said. \"Luckily\\nenough, I was just passing, and I brought you here.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, why didn\\'t you let me die?\" moaned the girl, so bitterly that he\\nwas shocked.\\n\\n\"It is very wicked to talk like that,\" he said, forcing down the great\\nlump that rose in his throat.\\n\\n\"No!\" she cried, vehemently. \"How could it be very wrong to leave a\\ngreat, cold, cruel world in which nobody wants you. I have nothing to\\nlive for.\"\\n\\n\"But somebody does want you, Ida May!\" cried the great rough fellow,\\nwith tears that were no disgrace to his manhood coursing down his\\ncheek. \"I want you with all my heart!\"\\n\\n\"Hush, hush, hush!\" she cried; \"you must not talk so to me!\" she cried.\\n\"Don\\'t say any more! It can never be! You do not know all!\"\\n\\n\"Do not say me nay. Give me the right to protect you, Ida. We can go\\naway from this village. I can get a job on the road anywhere along the\\nline. I will work for you, and tend to you so very carefully that you\\nwill forget the past!\"\\n\\nShe only turned away from him, pleading with him for the love of Heaven\\nto say no more. He stopped short, looking at her gloomily. He had used\\nall the words that he could command, and they had been of no avail. She\\nwould not even listen.\\n\\n\"One moment more!\" he cried, hoarsely. \"Always remember, Ida May, that\\nyou leave behind you a heart that beats only for you--only for you. No\\nother woman\\'s face shall ever win my love from you. I will wait here,\\nwhere you leave me, for long years, until you come back to me--ay, I\\nwill wait from day to day with this one hope in my heart: Some day she\\nwill come back to me; she will find the world too cold and hard, and\\nwill come back to me to comfort her. I will watch for you from darkness\\nuntil day dawns again. My form, so straight now, may grow bent with\\nyears, my hair grow white, and lines seam my face, but through it all I\\nshall watch for your coming until God rewards my vigilance. Good-bye,\\nand God bless you, Ida May, oh love of my heart!\"\\n\\nShe passed from his sight with those words ringing in her ears, and\\nwhen the New York express passed on again after she had boarded it,\\nthe young station-agent fell prone upon his face to the floor, and lay\\nthere like one dead.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII.\\n\\n\\nFew passengers turned to look at the little figure that entered the car\\nat the way-side station at so early an hour of the morning, and Ida May\\ncowered quickly down into the first seat. The clothes under the long,\\ndark cloak were saturated, but no one could see that, nor notice how\\ndamp and matted were the curling rings of dark hair which the hood of\\nthe cloak but half concealed. The hours crept on as the express whirled\\nover the rails; but Ida May paid no heed to time.\\n\\nBut hunger at last began to tell upon her, and she eagerly hailed a\\nboy who passed through the train with a basket of sandwiches on his arm.\\n\\nShe looked at the coins she still held loosely in her hand, and found\\nto her dismay that, with the exception of two pieces of silver, she\\nheld a handful of gold dollars.\\n\\n\"His pocket-pieces,\" she sobbed. \"Oh, if I had known that, I would have\\nrefused to take them; but--but I will work and earn money, and--and pay\\nhim back double their value. Poor fellow--poor fellow!\" and she laid\\nher face on the window-sill, sobbing as though her heart would break.\\n\\nSuddenly she heard a voice in the seat back of her say:\\n\\n\"You seem very much distressed, poor girl. Is there any way in which I\\ncan serve you?\"\\n\\nThe deep, musical voice was so kind, so humane, so sympathetic, that\\nIda May turned around with a start to see who it was who had asked the\\nquestion.\\n\\nShe saw directly back of her a fair, handsome young man who had\\nevidently just entered the car, and who was depositing his grip-sack\\nand umbrella in the rack above his head.\\n\\nAt the first glance a faint shriek broke from her lips. She was just\\nabout to cry out, \"Royal Ainsley--great Heaven!--do we meet again?\"\\nwhen she saw her error in time. Although bearing a certain resemblance\\nto the lover who had so cruelly betrayed her, a second glance told her\\nit was not him.\\n\\nIt was a moment ere she recovered herself sufficiently to answer, then\\nshe faltered, piteously:\\n\\n\"I _am_ in sorrow, sir, so great that I do not think any young girl\\nbut me could ever pass through it--and live.\"\\n\\n\"I do not wish to pry into your private affairs,\" said the young man,\\ncourteously, \"but I wish to repeat, if you will tell me what troubles\\nyou, and I can be of service to you, I shall be only too pleased.\\nAlthough a stranger, you will find me worthy of your confidence, my\\npoor child!\"\\n\\nThere was something about the handsome, kindly, blue-eyed young man\\nthat caused Ida May\\'s heart to go out to him at once. His was a face\\nthat women always trusted, and no one had ever had cause to regret it.\\n\\n\"I am going to New York in search of work,\" faltered the girl, clasping\\nher little hands closely together.\\n\\n\"That is certainly reason enough to weep,\" he replied earnestly. \"May I\\nask if you have friends there to whom you are going until you can find\\nemployment?\"\\n\\nIda May shook her head, her breast heaved, her white lips quivered,\\nwhile great tears welled up to the great dark eyes, so like purple\\nvelvet <DW29>s drowned in rain.\\n\\n\"I have no friends--no one. I am all alone in the world, sir,\" she\\nsobbed. \"My mother is dead--dead. I have just left her grave. She and\\nI were all in all to each other; now she is gone, and I--Oh, only the\\nangels know that no sorrow is so bleak, so pitiful, so awful, as to be\\nall alone in the world.\"\\n\\n\"I can understand the situation perfectly,\" he answered in a low voice,\\n\"and I can pity you. Although not quite alone in the world myself, I am\\nalmost as badly off. But to return to yourself: I may be able to serve\\nyou. What kind of employment were you intending to search for? In some\\nstore, or dress-making or millinery establishment?\" he queried.\\n\\nShe looked blankly up into his fair, handsome, earnest face.\\n\\n\"I do not know how to do anything of that kind,\" she answered, simply.\\n\"I thought perhaps I might find employment in some telegraph office.\"\\n\\n\"Why, yes, indeed. I wonder that that idea did not occur to me before.\\nA friend of mine is superintendent of a large branch of the Western\\nUnion, up Broadway. I will give you a note to him, and I have no doubt\\nhe will do all in his power to aid you, providing he has a vacancy.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, thank you a thousand times, sir,\" cried Ida May, thankfully; \"I\\nshall be so grateful--oh, so very grateful!\"\\n\\n\"Mind, it is not a certainty, you know,\" admonished the stranger\\nearnestly; \"I can only write the letter. But that is not assuring you\\nof a situation--we can only hope for it.\"\\n\\nHe tore out a leaf from his memorandum, and taking a gold pencil from\\nhis vest pocket, hastily jotted down a few lines upon it.\\n\\n\"I am sorry I am not going through to New York; otherwise I would take\\nyou there myself,\" he said, courteously, as he folded up the note and\\nhanded it to her.\\n\\nAt that moment his station was reached. He had barely time to touch his\\nhat to her, gather up his parcels, and alight, ere the train moved out\\nagain. The young man looked after it and the sweet, tearful young face\\npressed against one of the windows until it was out of sight.\\n\\n\"By all that is wonderful!\" he ejaculated in a very troubled voice, \"I\\nam almost positive that I forgot to sign my name to that note, and it\\nwas written so badly on that jolting car, Ernscourt won\\'t be able to\\nmake it out or know whose writing it is. Poor little girl! I hope she\\nwill find a position there. What a terrible thing it is to be young\\nand desolate in the great wicked city of New York! She is so young,\\nguileless and innocent, I hope no ill will befall her. I must remember\\nto look up my friend Ernscourt to learn if he gave her a position or\\nnot. I declare, if it were not that I am betrothed to the sweetest girl\\nin all the world, I am afraid I should commit the desperate folly of\\nfalling in love with that beautiful, dark-eyed little stranger. Now\\nthat I think of it, it did not occur to me to even ask her name or\\nwhere she was from.\"\\n\\nHis reverie was somewhat rudely interrupted by a hearty slap on the\\nshoulder and a hearty voice calling out gayly:\\n\\n\"Why, Royal, how are you, old fellow? What, in the name of all that\\'s\\namazing, brings you to Yonkers?\"\\n\\n\"Why, Hal, is this you?\" cried the other, in astonishment and delight.\\n\"This is an additional pleasure, meeting my old college chum fully a\\nthousand miles from where I would never have imagined finding him. But\\na word in your ear, my dear boy: It\\'s two years since you and I parted\\nat college, old fellow, and a great deal has happened in that time. We\\nwill walk up the street while I inform you.\"\\n\\n\"With the greatest of pleasure, Royal,\" returned his companion.\\n\\n\"Tut! tut! Don\\'t call me Royal--Royal Ainsley. I\\'m that no longer, you\\nknow--no, I suppose you don\\'t know; but that\\'s exactly what I want to\\ntalk to you about.\"\\n\\n\"I am too astonished for utterance,\" declared his friend.\\n\\n\"Why, the explanation is certainly simple enough,\" declared the other,\\nwith a good-natured, mellow little laugh; adding: \"Why, you, my college\\nchum, knew what many another friend of mine does _not_ know, namely,\\nthat there are two Royal Ainsleys, or, rather, there was up to the\\npresent year. It\\'s a bit of secret family history; but I am obliged to\\ntake you into my confidence, in order that you may fully understand my\\nmost peculiar position. Two brothers, who were almost enemies born,\\nmarried about the same time, and to each of the gentlemen--namely, my\\nuncle and my father, was born a son--my cousin and myself.\\n\\n\"These gentlemen had an eccentric elder brother who had money to burn,\\nas the saying is, and what should each of these younger brothers do but\\nname their sons after the wealthy old Royal Ainsley, if you please,\\neach hoping that _his_ son would be the old uncle\\'s heir.\\n\\n\"A pretty mess these two belligerent gentlemen made of the affair,\\nI assure you. Two Royal Ainsleys, each resembling the other to an\\nunpleasantly startling degree, of almost the same age, being born\\nscarcely a week apart.\\n\\n\"We were constantly getting into all manner of scrapes, a case of being\\ncontinually taken for the fellow that looks like me, as the song goes.\\nEach disputed with the other the right to bear the name, and neither\\nwould put a handle to it or do anything to cause it to differ in any\\nway from the cognomen of the famous old uncle, who was certainly quite\\nas bewildered as any one else.\\n\\n\"As we two lads grew older, I took to books, my cousin to sports\\nand the pretty faces of girls. When his folks died and he was left\\nto follow the bent of his own inclination, in spite of my earnest\\nadmonition and my uncle\\'s combined, he jumped the traces of home\\nrestraint altogether, and started out to see life on his own hook. The\\nlast I heard of him he was with some distant relative, clerking in a\\nNew York importing house.\\n\\n\"Now for _my_ side of the story. From the hour he defied uncle and\\nshook off his restraint, old Royal Ainsley\\'s hatred of him grew so\\nbitter we dared not mention my wayward cousin, Royal Ainsley, in\\nhis presence. My uncle actually forced me to change my name through\\nlegislative enactment to make it legal. He insisted upon naming me\\nEugene Mallard, declaring that my cousin would be sure to disgrace the\\nname of Royal Ainsley through the length and breadth of the land before\\nhe stopped in his mad downward career.\\n\\n\"Well, to make a long story short, my uncle sent me to Europe on\\nbusiness for him, and his sudden death brought me hurriedly home\\nthis week, to find that he has left me his entire fortune, with the\\nproviso that not one dollar shall ever go to my cousin, who, in all\\nprobability, does not yet know of his sad plight.\\n\\n\"Now, last but by no means least, on the steamer coming back from\\nLondon I met a beautiful young girl, Miss Hildegarde Cramer. It was a\\ncase of love at first sight between us. You know I\\'m a very impulsive\\nfellow. I proposed, and she accepted me on the spot; but mind, she\\nknows me as Eugene Mallard, and so she shall know me to the end of her\\nsweet life, bless her.\\n\\n\"Now you know the whole story. Mind, I\\'m not Royal Ainsley, but,\\ninstead, Eugene Mallard, at your service.\\n\\n\"Hildegarde is visiting in Yonkers, so I ran up to see my sweetheart.\\nSounds like a romance or a comedy, doesn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\"I hope there will be no tinge of tragedy in it,\" laughed his friend,\\nthoughtlessly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII.\\n\\n\\nWith a note of introduction to the superintendent clutched tightly\\nin her hand, Ida May reached New York City. She took barely time to\\nswallow a cup of coffee ere she hurried to the number indicated. Her\\nheart sunk within her as she looked up at the immense building; but\\nwith a courage which should have met with a better reward, she took\\nthe elevator, and soon found herself on the eighth floor, where the\\nsuperintendent\\'s office was situated.\\n\\n\"He is not in,\" an attendant told her. \"He left the city two days ago,\\nand is not expected to return for a fortnight.\"\\n\\nTears that she could not control sprung into Ida May\\'s dark eyes.\\n\\n\"Oh, what shall I do?\" cried the girl; \"I want to see him so much!\"\\n\\nThe attendant was moved to pity by her great distress.\\n\\n\"If you are looking for a position, or anything of that kind, perhaps I\\ncould suggest something.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, that is it, sir,\" exclaimed Ida May, looking up through her\\ntears--\"that is my errand. I want to secure a position.\"\\n\\n\"Then it is the manager, instead of the superintendent, you will have\\nto apply to. I think he is in his office. Step this way, please.\"\\n\\nHe threw open a door to the right, and Ida May followed him into a\\nlarge room, in which were dozens of young girls bending over tables.\\n\\nThe deafening click! click! click! of the telegraph instruments drowned\\nevery sound.\\n\\nSome girls never raised their heads, as Ida May, following the\\nattendant, passed down the long aisle. Others, however, glanced at her,\\nat first casually, which deepened instantly into a gaze of curiosity\\nand intense interest, for they had never beheld a creature with such\\nsuperb beauty. Their hearts beat with envy.\\n\\n\"The manager will be sure to engage her,\" they whispered. \"Her pretty\\nface will be sure to be a passport to favor. There used to be a time\\nwhen it was \\'How much do you know about the business?\\' but now it is\\n\\'What kind of a face have you? If it\\'s a pretty and dashing one, I\\'ll\\nengage you.\\' An old or a homely girl doesn\\'t stand any show whatever\\nnowadays.\"\\n\\nAll unconscious of these remarks, Ida May passed on. The attendant\\nthrew open another door at the end of a large room, and she found\\nherself in a luxuriously furnished office. A young and exceedingly\\nhandsome man sat at a desk writing. He glanced up angrily at the sound\\nof footsteps, and was about to make a sharp remark to the man, when he\\ncaught sight of the beautiful young creature he was ushering into his\\npresence.\\n\\n\"Ah, sit down,\" he said, blandly; \"I will attend to you in one moment.\"\\n\\nThe attendant had scarcely closed the door behind him ere the\\nmanager--for such he proved to be--turned quickly about and faced the\\nyoung girl.\\n\\n\"What can I do for you?\" he said in his blandest voice. He had taken\\nin at first glance the wondrous beauty of the young girl. It was\\ncertainly the most exquisite face he had ever beheld, and a strange\\ngleam leaped into his eyes. He told himself that, from her appearance,\\nshe had certainly come in search of a position. Ida May looked up into\\nthe dark, handsome face. Instinctively she shrunk from him, but could\\nnot tell why. Very timidly she stated her errand, the color on her\\nface deepening, as she could not help but notice the ardent glance of\\nadmiration he bent upon her, and there was something in the bold glance\\nof his eyes that made her feel extremely uncomfortable.\\n\\nIn a falteringly voice Ida stated her errand, and what experience she\\nhad had in her little village home. To her great delight and surprise,\\nhe answered quickly:\\n\\n\"I think I will be able to make a place for you. It would be a pity to\\nsend away such a pretty girl as you are.\"\\n\\nIda May drew back in alarm. She did not like the remark, nor the look\\nwhich accompanied it; but she dared not make an indignant reply.\\n\\n\"Where are you stopping?\" he asked in the next breath.\\n\\n\"I have just reached the city, sir,\" she responded. \"I came in search\\nof a position even before I found a place to stop.\"\\n\\n\"It is well you did so,\" he responded quickly. \"I know of a place that\\nI think will suit you. The lady has no other boarders. You would be\\ncompany for her. I would make this observation here and now: the girls\\nwe have here are a talkative set. Pay no attention to their remarks.\"\\n\\nHe wrote an address on a slip of paper, and handed it to the girl.\\n\\n\"I am very grateful, sir, for the interest you have taken in me, a poor\\ngirl,\" she said, tremulously. \"Shall I report to-day for work, sir?\"\\nshe asked. \"I should like to commence as soon as possible.\"\\n\\n\"To-morrow will do,\" he answered.\\n\\nWith a heart full of thanks, she left the office.\\n\\nFrank Garrick, the manager, looked after her with a smile that was not\\npleasant to see.\\n\\n\"I have run across many a little beauty in my time,\" he muttered,\\ngazing after her, \"but surely never such an exquisite little beauty as\\nthis one.\"\\n\\nThe girls looked at one another, nodding grimly, when Ida May presented\\nherself for duty the next day.\\n\\n\"Didn\\'t I tell you how it would be?\" sneered one of the girls. \"Our\\nhandsome manager, Mr. Garrick, was captivated by the girl\\'s beauty, as\\nI knew he would be, and engaged her, although he refused to take on,\\nonly the day before, three girls whom I knew to be actually starving.\"\\n\\nThere was one girl who looked at Ida May with darkening eyes.\\n\\nShe bent over her task; but though the hours passed, the terrible look\\nnever left her face.\\n\\n\"Nannie is jealous,\" more than one girl whispered to her neighbor. \"You\\nsee, she\\'s head over heels in love with our manager. If he so much as\\nlooks at any other girl that passes along, she sulks for a week. What\\nfun it would be to make her jealous. Oh, let\\'s try, girls! Let\\'s put up\\na job on her. It would be such fun!\"\\n\\n\"Not for the new-comer!\" laughed another girl.\\n\\n\"Nannie would make it pretty hot for her here.\"\\n\\nLittle dreaming of the tempest they were stirring up, the girls\\nthoughtlessly planned their little joke. Their shouts of laughter would\\nhave been turned into tears of pity could they have beheld the harvest\\nof woe that was to spring from it.\\n\\nNannie Rogers noticed that the beautiful new-comer was assigned to an\\ninstrument at a table almost directly opposite the private office. This\\ninflamed the jealously of Nannie Rogers.\\n\\nShe noted how he watched her from the window of his office all the next\\nday.\\n\\nMore than one girl called Nannie Rogers\\' attention to this at noon-hour.\\n\\n\"You will have to look to your laurels, Nan,\" more than one declared,\\nbanteringly. \"You will find this Ida May a rival, I fear.\"\\n\\n\"Any girl had better be dead than attempt to be a rival of mine,\" she\\nanswered.\\n\\nThere came a time when the girls remembered that remark all too\\nforcibly.\\n\\nIda May bent over her task, paying little attention to anything around\\nher. She was trying to forget her double sorrow, all that she had gone\\nthrough, and the death of her poor mother that had followed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV.\\n\\n\\nIda May had found no difficulty whatever in securing board at the place\\nwhere Frank Garrick had suggested.\\n\\nMrs. Cole, who owned the cottage, told Ida that she was a widow.\\n\\n\"I have a little income that keeps me comfortable,\" she added; \"but to\\naccommodate my friend, Mr. Garrick, I will take you in.\"\\n\\n\"He is a friend of yours?\" exclaimed the girl.\\n\\n\"Yes; I used to be in the telegraph office before I married,\" she\\nresponded. \"In fact, my husband and Mr. Garrick were both paying\\nattention to me at the same time. To be candid, I liked Mr. Garrick\\nthe better; but we had a little misunderstanding, and through pique\\nI married his rival. I lost sight of him after that until my husband\\ndied. After I became a widow he called upon me several times.\"\\n\\nShe gave the impression to Ida that she expected a proposal from her\\nold lover some time in the near future, but the girl paid little heed\\nto the blushing widow. Her thoughts were elsewhere.\\n\\nOne evening, at the end of the second week, as Ida was hurrying\\nhomeward, she was startled by a step behind her.\\n\\n\"You seem to be in a hurry, Miss May,\" a voice said; and turning\\nquickly around, she beheld the handsome manager, Mr. Garrick.\\n\\n\"I _am_ in a hurry!\" she assented. \"I am a little late now, and Mrs.\\nCole does not like me to keep supper waiting.\"\\n\\n\"Never mind what she likes,\" he returned, impatiently. \"Let us take a\\nlittle walk, I have something to say to you, pretty one.\"\\n\\nThere was something in his eyes, his voice, that somehow startled her.\\n\\n\"Pardon me, but I do not care to walk,\" she said, simply, with the\\nhaughty air of a young princess.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t put on airs,\" he said, harshly; \"you are not very wise to try to\\nsnub a manager who has the power to turn you out of your position at\\nany moment.\"\\n\\nIda grew frightfully pale.\\n\\n\"Come, let us take a little walk,\" he urged. \"You\\'re a very pretty\\ngirl, and I like you.\"\\n\\nIda May drew back with an exclamation of alarm.\\n\\n\"I refuse to walk with you!\" she said.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t make an enemy of me, Ida May!\" he hissed between his teeth.\\n\\n\"If such a trifle will make an enemy, I would rather make an enemy than\\na friend of you!\" she answered.\\n\\n\"Are you mad, girl, to defy me like this?\" he cried, setting his white\\nteeth together, his eyes fairly blazing.\\n\\n\"I have no wish to defy you! I can not see why my refusing to walk with\\nyou should offend you!\"\\n\\n\"Come, be reasonable,\" he urged; \"let us have a little quiet talk. I\\nhave called at your boarding-house half a dozen times since you have\\nbeen there, but that idiotic fool, who is half in love with me herself,\\nwould not let me see you. I might have known how it would be: I\\'ll look\\nfor another boarding-place at once for you.\"\\n\\nThe interest he took in her alarmed her.\\n\\n\"I am very well satisfied where I am, Mr. Garrick,\" she answered, with\\ndignity. \"I beg that you will not call upon me, for I do not care to\\nreceive gentlemen callers.\"\\n\\nAgain a rage that was terrible to see flashed into his eyes.\\n\\n\"You _must_ see me!\" he hissed. \"It is not for you to be chooser.\\nDon\\'t you see I have taken a fancy to you,\" he said, throwing off all\\nreserve. \"You must be mine! I never really knew what love meant until I\\nsaw you!\"\\n\\n\"Stop! Stop!\" panted Ida May. \"I will not listen to another word. You\\nmust not talk to me of love!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I loved you, Ida May, from the first time I saw you. There was\\nsomething about you which thrilled my heart and caused me to wish that\\nyou should be mine, cost what it would!\"\\n\\n\"I will not listen to another word!\" said Ida May.\\n\\nHe laughed an insolent laugh that made the blood fairly boil in her\\nveins.\\n\\n\"Come, we will go into this restaurant where we can talk at our\\nleisure.\"\\n\\nHe had caught her by the arm. With a cry of terror the girl wrenched\\nherself free from his grasp and fairly flew down the street, and she\\ndid not stop until she reached her boarding-house.\\n\\n\"Why, dear me, Miss May, one would think you were flying from a\\ncyclone!\" declared Mrs. Cole, who was just passing through the hall as\\nshe came in.\\n\\nGasping for breath, and scarcely able to keep from tears, Ida May told\\nher all, believing that the woman would sympathize with her.\\n\\n\"Why, you are more of a prude than I thought you were,\" said Mrs. Cole.\\n\\nIda May drew back with dilated eyes.\\n\\n\"You, a woman, to tell me this! Why, I tell you he was insulting me!\"\\ncried the girl, vehemently.\\n\\nMrs. Cole laughed cynically.\\n\\n\"Nonsense!\" she declared. \"You might do worse than accept his\\nattentions. He\\'s over head and heels in love with you. I could have\\ntold you that a week ago.\"\\n\\n\"He is a bold, bad man!\" cried Ida May. \"And yet you would counsel me\\nto encourage him wouldn\\'t you?\"\\n\\nThe elder woman shrugged her shoulders.\\n\\n\"Any one could easily see that you are a country girl,\" she said, with\\na harsh laugh that grated on the girl who listened with amazement.\\n\\nWith this parting shot the woman turned on her heel and left Ida May\\nstaring after her.\\n\\nTo Ida\\'s intense anxiety, her landlady was unusually cool at the\\ntea-table. She did not come up to Ida May\\'s room that evening to chat,\\nbut announced that she had a headache, needed quiet, and would stay\\nin her own room. Her presence during the long evenings had done much\\ntoward making the girl forget her sorrow, and she felt her absence\\nkeenly enough on this night when she had so much need of sympathy.\\n\\nFeeling too restless to commune with her own thoughts, she concluded to\\nread a book to fill in the time that hung so heavily on her hands.\\n\\nIda May descended to the sitting-room, where, she remembered, she had\\nleft the book on the table. She went down the carpeted stairs quietly,\\npassing Mrs. Cole\\'s door with noiseless feet, that she might not\\ndisturb her.\\n\\nAs she stood before the door of the sitting-room, with her hand on the\\nknob, she was suddenly attracted by the sound of voices from within,\\nher own name falling distinctly upon her ears. She stood still with\\nastonishment, for the voice that uttered her name was that of Frank\\nGarrick.\\n\\nHer first impulse was to turn quickly away; but the words that she\\nheard him utter held her spell-bound.\\n\\nMr. Garrick was talking to Mrs. Cole in a low, excited voice, and what\\nthe girl heard filled her soul with wildest terror.\\n\\nFor a moment she stood irresolute; then her decision was made. As soon\\nas the morning broke, she would leave that house.\\n\\nShe flew back to her room, her mind in a whirl, her brain dizzy with\\nconflicting emotions. She sat down in a chair by the open window,\\nand leaned her hot, flushed face in the palms of her hands. She was\\nbeginning to learn the lessons of the great, wicked world. How long she\\nsat there she never knew.\\n\\nShe was planning about what she should do when the morrow came. Though\\nshe starved on the street, she would not go back to the telegraph\\noffice where Frank Garrick was; nor could she remain in the house that\\nnow sheltered her, where the woman who pretended to be her friend and\\ncounselor was deliberately plotting against her.\\n\\nShe had purchased a dress, cloak, and hat out of the money she had\\nfound in her pocket. This expenditure had reduced the little sum\\nconsiderably; but she had been obliged to present a respectable\\nappearance.\\n\\nWhere should she look for work in the great big city? While she was\\ncogitating over the matter, Mrs. Cole appeared in the door-way with a\\nglass of lemonade in her hand.\\n\\n\"I have brought you something very refreshing, Ida,\" she said. \"It took\\naway _my_ headache, and it will make you enjoy a good night\\'s sleep.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, but I do not care for the lemonade,\" returned the girl,\\ncoldly.\\n\\nHer first impulse had been to spring to her feet, and inform her that\\nshe had accidently overheard her conversation with Frank Garrick, and\\nupbraid her for it in the bitterest of words. Then the thought occurred\\nto her that discretion was the better part of valor--to say nothing,\\nand leave the house quietly in the morning.\\n\\n\"But I insist upon your drinking the lemonade,\" declared the young\\nwidow.\\n\\nIda looked at her steadily, and something in the reproachful glance of\\nthe girl\\'s eyes made her wince. The hand that held the glass shook in\\nspite of her efforts at composure.\\n\\n\"It will induce an excellent night\\'s sleep, my dear,\" said Mrs. Cole,\\nsmoothly. \"Stir it up; you are letting all the sugar settle at the\\nbottom.\"\\n\\n\"I do not care for it,\" repeated Ida, a trifle more haughtily.\\n\\n\"But as it is for your good, you _must_ drink it!\" repeated her\\ncompanion. \"I shall not leave the room until you do so.\"\\n\\nAt that moment Katie, the little maid of all work, entered the room\\nwith towels.\\n\\nPassing near the back of her chair, she managed to whisper in her ear,\\nunobserved by Mrs. Cole:\\n\\n\"Promise her to drink the lemonade if she will leave it on the table;\\nbut don\\'t touch a drop of it. I\\'ll tell you why later.\"\\n\\nThe remark was accompanied by a warning glance from the girl\\'s eyes.\\nLaying down the towels, Katie retreated to the door; but the warning\\nlook that she cast back at her aroused Ida May.\\n\\n\"Set the glass down, and I will drink the lemonade later on,\" she said,\\nquietly.\\n\\n\"Do you promise me that you will?\" said Mrs. Cole, with unusual\\ninterest.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Ida, hesitatingly. \"Put it down on the table.\"\\n\\n\"I will come back in ten minutes,\" declared Mrs. Cole, \"and if you have\\nnot drunk it by that time--well, I\\'ll make you, that\\'s all,\" she added,\\nwith a forced laugh, but meaning just what she said.\\n\\nIda May sat down when she found herself alone, wondering in amazement\\nwhat Katie could have meant by her strange words. At that moment the\\ngirl glided into the room.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV.\\n\\n\\n\"Oh! do not touch it, my dear young lady!\" cried Katie, rushing into\\nthe room and seizing the lemonade with hands that were trembling.\\n\"Listen, miss,\" she cried in an awful whisper. \"They put something into\\nit--the lemonade is drugged!\"\\n\\nIda May looked at her with the utmost astonishment. She could scarcely\\nunderstand her words.\\n\\n\"I saw them do it!\" repeated the girl. \"I heard him say, \\'Put in\\nenough, and it will make her sleep soundly.\\' It was a white powder he\\nhad brought with him,\" the maid went on, excitedly. \"Oh, he makes such\\na dupe of my poor mistress! He has hypnotized her so that she is afraid\\nto say that her soul is her own. I heard a great deal more that he\\nsaid, but I can not tell you now. All I can do is to warn you. Go away\\nfrom here as quickly as you can. They are enemies of yours, both of\\nthem.\"\\n\\nThe girl\\'s words terrified Ida May. She recalled Frank Garrick\\'s words\\nas he walked along the street beside her.\\n\\n\"Take care! beware, girl! You had better not make an enemy of me! If\\nyou do, you will rue the hour! For I can make it very unpleasant for\\nyou. Ay, you will be sorry that you were ever born.\"\\n\\nShe _had_ made an enemy of him, and now he was about to take some\\nterrible revenge upon her. She did not have time to exchange another\\nword with the maid, for she had fled from the room as quickly as she\\nhad entered it, and she was left alone with her conflicting thoughts.\\n\\nThe window was open, and she threw the contents of the glass out on the\\npavement below.\\n\\nShe had scarcely set it down, before Mrs. Cole glided into the room.\\n\\n\"Ah! you have drunk the lemonade. That\\'s right!\" she added in a\\ntriumphant tone. \"But I won\\'t sit down to talk to you to-night; you\\nlook sleepy. I would advise you to retire at once.\"\\n\\nIda looked at her steadily, remembering the startling words that Katie\\nhad whispered in her ears. Was this a woman or a fiend incarnate? Ida\\nwondered.\\n\\nHer footsteps had scarcely died away ere Ida took down a long dark\\ncloak, and hurriedly donning it, together with her hat and veil, she\\ngathered her effects together, and thrusting them into a hand-bag,\\nstole silently as a shadow out into the darkened hall. As she passed\\nthe sitting-room door she heard the sound of voices.\\n\\nFrank Garrick was still there.\\n\\nIn the shadow of the vestibule door she saw Katie waiting for her.\\n\\n\"Good-bye, and God bless you, Ida May!\" she said, holding out her\\nrough, toil-worn little hand.\\n\\n\"Good-bye, and thank you for the service you have rendered me,\" she\\nanswered, with deep feeling. \"If we ever meet again, perhaps it may be\\nin my power to repay you,\" added Ida, the tears standing out on her\\nlong lashes.\\n\\nShe little dreamed that the hour would come when she would be called\\nupon to remember that promise.\\n\\nOut of the house she stole, out into the darkness of the street.\\n\\nAt last, when faint and almost falling down from exhaustion, she ran\\ndirectly into the arms of a blue coat who was leisurely passing a\\ncorner.\\n\\n\"Halloo there, my good girl!\" he cried. \"What are you doing out at this\\nhour of the night?\"\\n\\nTrembling piteously, and all unnerved at this unexpected encounter, for\\na moment the girl was speechless.\\n\\n\"I am trying to find shelter until to-morrow morning, sir,\" she said.\\n\"Then I shall look for work.\"\\n\\nBut the officer would not parley with her. He grasped her by the arm,\\nand was forcing the sobbing girl along, when he was suddenly confronted\\nby a young man who was passing, and who had witnessed the affair.\\n\\n\"Officer,\" he said, sternly, \"this is an outrage. Why do you not let\\nthat young girl go her way in peace? Why do you molest her?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s my duty to run in every girl who walks the street at night,\\nwithout a justifiable reason.\"\\n\\n\"Let _me_ be responsible for this young woman,\" said the man. \"I\\nbelieve what she told you to be true--that she wants to find a place to\\nstop until day-break, and then she will look for work.\"\\n\\nThe officer recognized the young man at once.\\n\\n\"If _you_ will vouch for her,\" he said, \"why, she can go her way,\\ncertainly.\"\\n\\n\"I think I\\'m a tolerably good judge of character,\" returned the young\\nman, \"and I see nothing in her face to mistrust. Take her to one of the\\nmissions near at hand. She can certainly stay there till morning.\"\\n\\nThe policeman made a low bow, and the young man passed on.\\n\\n\"You have interested one of the richest young men in New York in your\\nbehalf,\" said the policeman, after they had passed on.\\n\\nIda did not ask the name of her benefactor, though she felt deeply\\ngrateful for the kind service he had rendered her.\\n\\nThe matron of the home for friendless girls received the young girl\\nwith the kindliness that characterized her.\\n\\nShe assigned her a little cot, and, wretched and footsore, Ida May\\nthrew herself upon it and sobbed herself to sleep.\\n\\nThe matron looked at her as she passed through the long dormitory on\\nher way to her room.\\n\\n\"She has a sweet face!\" she muttered, as she turned away; \"but one on\\nwhich a tragedy is written.\"\\n\\nIda May was sitting in the reception-room when the matron passed\\nthrough it the next morning, and she asked her if there was anything\\nshe could do for her.\\n\\n\"If you could only tell me, please, where I could find something to\\ndo,\" she answered. \"I must find work, or--starve!\"\\n\\n\"When do you wish to look for a situation?\" asked the matron, noting\\nhow wan and pale the girl looked.\\n\\n\"This day, this very hour!\" cried Ida May, eagerly.\\n\\nThe matron hesitated.\\n\\n\"I must first know what sort of employment you are seeking--what you\\nare best suited for.\"\\n\\n\"I am suited for nothing,\" Ida answered, despondently. \"But that\\nmust not deter me. If one did only the work one was fitted for,\\nthree-quarters of the world would be idle.\"\\n\\n\"Would you take a situation as governess if one could be found for you?\"\\n\\nShe shook her head dejectedly.\\n\\n\"I have not education enough,\" she replied. \"I did not have much\\nopportunity of going to school when I was a little girl, and I am\\nsuffering for it now.\"\\n\\nAfter a moment\\'s pause the matron said, thoughtfully:\\n\\n\"Would you like to try dress-making?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s another thing that I know nothing about,\" she said. \"I was\\nnever taught to mend or sew. I always got out of it. Mother did it for\\nme rather than scold me.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps you would take a position as lady\\'s-maid.\"\\n\\nA gasp, a shiver passed over her. Quick as lightning there flashed\\nbefore her mind the humiliation of three or four maids who had\\naccompanied their mistresses to the Ocean Hotel, at Newport, and how\\nLily Ryder and Hildegarde Cramer had turned up their noses at them\\nbecause they had pretty faces, and had dared to pin in a pretty ribbon\\nor two in the lace caps they were forced to wear on all occasions.\\n\\n\"I am afraid I wouldn\\'t be a success at that,\" she declared.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t suppose you would like to be a house-maid,\" suggested the\\nmatron, looking at the small white hands that lay in the girl\\'s\\nlap--the blue-veined hands that were never designed to scour kettles or\\nclean floors. \"My dear child,\" said the matron, compassionately, \"there\\nis little else in a great city to do.\"\\n\\nThere was a pause--a pause broken presently by Ida May.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you think that if I could get into one of those large stores,\\nI could try on cloaks and hats without requiring any great amount of\\nknowledge of any kind?\"\\n\\nThe matron looked doubtful.\\n\\n\"It is not as easy as you may imagine, my dear, to obtain admission\\ninto any of those large stores. They have any amount of girls on their\\nbooks who are waiting eagerly for positions--persons with whom they\\nare acquainted--and they would stand a better chance than a stranger.\\nBesides, I hardly think a situation in a place of that kind would be\\nsuitable for one so young. We will look over the paper and read the\\nadvertisements.\"\\n\\nShe touched a bell, and told the attendant who answered it to bring in\\nthe morning paper.\\n\\n\"You can look over it, my child,\" said the matron. \"I will return in\\nhalf an hour. By that time you will perhaps have found something that\\nwill suit you.\"\\n\\nLeft alone, Ida May commenced to look through the \"Want\" columns.\\n\\nAll through sixteen columns of the paper the girl\\'s eyes eagerly ran.\\nShe did not find anything that she was competent to do, and tears of\\nvexation rolled down her cheeks.\\n\\nSuddenly her eyes rested upon an advertisement which she must have\\nmissed in her hurried examination of the column.\\n\\n\"Wanted.--A few more hands in a cotton-mill. No. -- Canal Street.\\nApplicants must apply between the hours of nine and ten, this A. M.\"\\n\\nLittle dreaming of what was to come of it, Ida May concluded that this\\nwas certainly the only position she could dare apply for.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI.\\n\\n\\nThe matron entered presently, and Ida May showed her the advertisement\\nthat had attracted her attention.\\n\\n\"It might be as well to try that,\" said the matron, encouragingly.\\n\\nShe looked after the girl as she went slowly down the steps, and shook\\nher head sadly.\\n\\nAs usual, Ida May\\'s lovely face attracted the envy of all the girls\\nin the mill. The foreman, as well as the clerks in the office, admired\\nher, and that was enough to make the girls detest her.\\n\\nIda had secured lodgings in a boarding-house where a score of the girls\\nstopped. She shared her room with Emily Downs, a very quiet little\\nthing, who had been a general favorite with the girls up to this time.\\n\\nMatters were going from bad to worse in the mill. The girls gathered\\ntogether in little groups here and there, and looked darkly at Ida May.\\nEven those who were wont to say \"good-night\" or \"good-morning\" passed\\nher by without a word.\\n\\nThe comments of the jealous girls became louder and deeper as another\\nfortnight dragged its slow lengths by. Whether Ida May heard or heeded\\nthem, they did not care to know. The beautiful face grew whiter still,\\nand the large dark eyes became more pitiful in their pathetic terror.\\n\\nThe girls gathered together one noon hour, and held a long and excited\\nconversation.\\n\\nIda and Emily Downs were eating their luncheon at the further end of\\nthe room, quite apart by themselves. Emily could see that something of\\nan unusual order was transpiring, by the girl\\'s fierce gesticulations\\nand the angry glances that were cast upon her companion, who seemed\\noblivious to it all.\\n\\nAt length one of them called Emily to them. There was a whispered\\nconversation, and looking mechanically across the table at that moment,\\nIda May saw Emily start back with a cry of horror.\\n\\n\"They are talking about me,\" thought Ida, crushing back a sob. \"They\\nwant to turn the only friend I have from me.\"\\n\\nShe finished her simple luncheon in silence. It was scarcely concluded\\nere she noticed with wonder that the girls had formed a group and were\\nmarching over in her direction in a body. There were fully fifty of\\nthem, and Ida noticed with wonder that the face of every one of them\\nwas white, set, and stern.\\n\\n\"Ida May,\" said the ringleader, harshly, \"we have something to say to\\nyou!\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" she answered, thinking that they had reconsidered the matter,\\nand were going to ask her to join them.\\n\\nFor a moment the girl seemed at a loss to know what to say, but the\\nangry murmurs of her companions in the rear nerved her to her task.\\n\\n\"After consultation, we have concluded that, as respectable girls, we\\ncan not remain in the mills another day if you are allowed to work\\nhere. You must leave at once, or we shall do so.\"\\n\\nFor an instant Ida May was fairly dazed. She scarcely believed that she\\nhad heard aright--surely her senses were playing her false. She sprung\\nto her feet, and confronted the girls, who stood, with angered faces,\\nlooking at her.\\n\\n\"Surely you can not mean what you say!\" she gasped. \"What have I done\\nthat you should say this to me?\"\\n\\nThe ringleader looked at her with withering scorn.\\n\\n\"We do not consider you a proper companion to mingle among us,\"\\nreturned the girl, stolidly. \"We all work for our living in this\\ncotton-mill, but if we _are_ poor we are _honest_. Is that plain enough\\nfor you to understand? If not, I will add this\"--and stepping up to\\nthe trembling girl\\'s side, she whispered a few sharp words in her\\near--words that made Ida May recoil as though they had been thrusts of\\na knife that cut to her heart.\\n\\nWith a piteous cry she sunk on her knees, covering her death-white face\\nwith her trembling hands.\\n\\n\"It remains with you to deny or affirm our accusation,\" went on the\\ngirl, harshly \"What have you to say to our charge, Ida May; is it true\\nor false?\"\\n\\nThere was no answer, save the heartrending sobs of the girl cowering\\nbefore them in such abject misery--surely the most pitiful a human\\nheart ever knew.\\n\\n\"You see she _can not_ deny it,\" cried the ringleader, turning\\ntriumphantly to her companions. \"I assured you all that I was certain\\nbefore I advised this step. We may well look upon her with scorn; she\\nis not worthy to breathe the same air with us!\"\\n\\nIda May rose slowly to her feet.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII.\\n\\n\\nHalf fainting with grief and pain, Ida May rushed out into the street.\\n\\nThe sun was shining bright and warm, but it seemed to the girl that the\\nwhole earth was dark and gloomy.\\n\\nWhere should she go? Which way should she turn? She would not go back\\nto the little lodging-house for her few belongings; she never wanted to\\nsee it again. Let them do what they would with her few belongings. The\\nfew dollars that were hers, she happened to have in the pocket of her\\ndress.\\n\\n\"Royal!\" she murmured, \"I can not go to you in this hour of my deepest\\nwoe!\"\\n\\nShe drew her veil down over her face, and the passers-by did not see\\nthe tears that rolled like rain down her white, despairing face. It\\nmattered little to her which way she went.\\n\\nSuddenly she heard the sound of a voice just ahead of her--a voice that\\nsent a thrill to her heart.\\n\\n\"Heaven pity me!\" she gasped; \"it is Royal Ainsley!\"\\n\\nHe was bidding good-bye to a companion on the corner.\\n\\nThe next moment he had boarded a street car. With a smothered cry, Ida\\nMay sprung after him. She must see him, she must speak to him!\\n\\nThe car was crowded. He was in the front of the car and she was at the\\nrear. There was no way of speaking to him. She must ride in the car as\\nfar as he did, and when he alighted she must follow him. As she watched\\nhim with strained eyes, she saw him greet a young and lovely girl.\\n\\nThe sight made the blood turn cold in her veins: Light, airy, gay as of\\nyore he was, all unconscious of the misery he had brought to a human\\nheart. He had wrecked her life. How could he stand there smiling into\\nthe face of another girl?\\n\\nIda\\'s heart swelled with bitter anguish.\\n\\nShe saw the young girl alight from the car at the corner of a\\nfashionable street, and Royal Ainsley accompanied her. He took her arm\\nand bent lovingly over her. She was some rich man\\'s daughter. Ida May,\\nwho followed in their footsteps, was sure of that.\\n\\nThey entered a handsome brown-stone house midway up the street. The\\nveiled, dark-robed little figure passed on, and stood at the end of the\\nstreet until he should reappear. Scores of pedestrians passed as the\\nhours rolled on.\\n\\nUp and down past the house she paced under cover of the darkness. As\\nshe paced slowly to the other end of the street, a coach stopped before\\nthe house she was so intently watching.\\n\\nBefore she could reach a place where she could get a full view, Royal\\nAinsley, with one or two others--she could not tell whether they were\\nmen or women--ran lightly down the steps and entered the vehicle, which\\nrolled rapidly away.\\n\\n\"I have missed him!\" sobbed Ida May. \"God help me!\"\\n\\nOn the morrow, Ida May was so ill that she could not leave the little\\nroom to which she had come for temporary shelter.\\n\\nThe woman who kept the place took a great interest in her.\\n\\nBut every night, as soon as dusk had fallen, Ida May took up her lonely\\nvigil before the house Royal Ainsley had visited.\\n\\nIn her anxiety she did not notice that she had been observed from\\nan upper window by the mistress of the mansion. One night she found\\nherself suddenly confronted by that lady.\\n\\n\"What are you doing here?\" she asked, grasping her by the shoulder.\\n\"Speak at once!\"\\n\\nFor a moment Ida May was so taken aback that she could not utter a\\nsound.\\n\\n\"Answer me at once, or I will have you arrested!\" repeated the lady.\\n\\nIda May hung down her head.\\n\\n\"I must and will know!\" cried the lady, pitilessly. \"Are you watching\\nfor the butler or any of the servants?\"\\n\\nThe young girl lifted her head as proudly as any young queen might have\\ndone. She remembered those weeks at Newport, during which she had been\\nconsidered the equal of the wealthiest girl there.\\n\\n\"No, madame!\" she answered, sharply, \"I was not waiting for any of your\\nservants to appear, but for one of your guests.\"\\n\\nThe lady gave a little gasp; but in an instant she recovered herself.\\n\\n\"A guest!\" she repeated. \"Of whom are you speaking?\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Royal Ainsley,\" replied Ida May, gasping the words out brokenly,\\nthe tears falling like rain down her face.\\n\\n\"Come inside,\" said the lady, drawing her hurriedly into the hall-way,\\nlest she should create a scene. \"Now,\" she said, standing before the\\ngirl with folded arms, \"let me hear all about the matter. You must\\nspeak the truth, or I will certainly force it from you.\"\\n\\n\"It would illy become me to speak anything but the truth,\" responded\\nIda May. \"Royal Ainsley comes here to see some beautiful young girl who\\nlives in this house. But this must not be. He is mine--mine--by every\\ntie that binds man to woman!\"\\n\\n\"Surely he is not your--your--husband?\" exclaimed the lady, excitedly.\\n\\n\"He--he should have been,\" sobbed Ida May, in a quivering voice. \"It\\nwas all a mistake, a terrible mistake,\" she continued, wringing her\\nhands.\\n\\nThe lady, who did not know her story, mistook her.\\n\\nWhen she told her she started back in wonder.\\n\\nQuick as thought she had decided upon her course of action.\\n\\n\"I wish to make an appointment with you,\" she said, \"to talk over this\\nmatter. Can you come here to-morrow?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Ida May. \"I shall be too busy. I have some work from one of\\nthe stores, that will keep me engaged.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps I can assist you so that it will not be necessary for you to\\nwork so hard. Still, if to-morrow is inconvenient, come in the evening.\"\\n\\nShe was about to add, \"I pity you;\" but there was something in the\\ngirl\\'s face that forbid her pity.\\n\\nThe lady watched her curiously until she was out of sight. Then, with\\na sigh of relief, she walked slowly up the grand staircase to her\\n_boudoir_.\\n\\nA young and lovely girl was reclining on a couch, turning over the\\nleaves of a photograph album.\\n\\n\"Well, did you find out what is the matter with the girl?\" she asked.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said the elder woman. \"And you would never guess what it was.\"\\n\\n\"Pardon me; but I shall not even try,\" said the young girl, indolently,\\n\"for the simple reason that it would be too much of an effort for me.\"\\n\\n\"I will tell you,\" said the lady, drawing up a chair; \"and I want you\\nto pay the strictest attention, Florence St. John.\"\\n\\n\"The subject will not interest me, mamma,\" returned the young girl,\\nturning over the leaves.\\n\\n\"But it _will_ interest you,\" returned the other, \"when I tell you that\\nit concerns your new handsome lover.\"\\n\\nShe was quite right. The album fell to the floor with a crash.\\n\\n\"It appears,\" said Mrs. St. John, \"that young Ainsley has got into some\\nkind of an intrigue with a poor but very pretty shop-girl. I think she\\nmust be a shop-girl.\"\\n\\n\"I shall write to him at once never to cross this threshold again!\"\\ncried the young girl, indignantly.\\n\\n\"You will do nothing of the kind,\" replied her mother. \"Sit down and\\nlisten to me. All young men are wild, and you must not take a man to\\ntask for what he has done before he knew you. Shut your eyes to it, and\\nnever bring it up to him. That\\'s always safest. If he thinks you _do_\\nknow about his past life, he will be reckless, and think he doesn\\'t\\nneed to care.\"\\n\\n\"About this girl, mamma--who is she?\" she asked.\\n\\n\"A very pretty young creature,\" was the reply.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII.\\n\\n\\nFaint and heart-sick, Ida May crept down the broad stone steps of the\\nelegant mansion, and wended her way back to her humble lodgings. Just\\nas she was about to touch the bell, a man ran hastily up the steps.\\n\\n\"Well, well, I declare!\" he exclaimed, \"I am at the wrong house. But in\\nthis confounded tenement row, one house is so like the other that one\\ncan not help making a mistake now and then.\"\\n\\nWith a gasp, Ida May reeled backward. At the very first word he had\\nuttered, Ida May had recognized Royal Ainsley.\\n\\nIt was Frank Garrick, the manager of the telegraph office.\\n\\nThe sentence had scarcely left his lips ere he recognized her.\\n\\n\"Aha!\" he cried, a fierce imprecation accompanying the words. \"So it\\'s\\n_you_, Ida May?\" he added, catching her fiercely by the cloak. \"So I\\nhave found you at last!\"\\n\\nShe was too frightened to reply.\\n\\n\"So this is where you are stopping, is it? Come, walk as far as the end\\nof the street with me. I want to talk to you.\"\\n\\n\"No!\" cried Ida May, struggling to free herself from his grasp. \"I have\\nnothing to say to you, nor will I listen to you!\"\\n\\n\"We shall see about that presently,\" he cried. \"Frank Garrick is not a\\nman to be balked in this way by a little girl. You _shall_ listen to\\nme!\"\\n\\nIda May reached out her hand quickly to touch the bell, but he\\nanticipated the movement, and caught her arm roughly.\\n\\nShe tried to cry out, but no sound issued from her lips.\\n\\nShe had already gone through more than her overstrained nerves could\\nbear. Without a cry or a moan, she sunk in a dead faint at his feet.\\n\\nGathering her up in his arms, Frank Garrick sprung quickly down the\\nsteps. For a moment he stood there with his helpless burden in his arms.\\n\\n\"This is quite an unexpected go,\" he muttered, standing there undecided\\nfor a moment. \"I must leave her here a moment, that is certain, while I\\nrun for a man\\'s voice.\"\\n\\nHe placed Ida on the the lower step, in a sitting position, and darted\\ndown the street in the direction of a cab-stand.\\n\\nHe did not see the open window of an adjoining house, because of the\\nclosed blind which protected it, nor the crouching form of the woman\\nbehind it, who had heard and witnessed all.\\n\\nLike a flash she caught up her hat, which was lying on an adjacent\\ntable, and sprung out of the door.\\n\\n\"I knew he would come to see her at last!\" she said, fairly hissing\\nthe words. \"They have had a quarrel. That is why he has stayed away so\\nlong. He has gone after a cab to take her elsewhere. But I will block\\nhis little game!\" cried Nannie Rogers--for it was she. \"I shall take a\\nterrible revenge upon him by striking him through her.\"\\n\\nTaking a short cut to a nearer cab-stand, she hailed the first vehicle.\\nThe man sprung down from his box.\\n\\n\"Why, is that you, Nannie?\" he cried, in unfeigned surprise.\\n\\n\"Yes, Joe,\" she answered, quickly. \"I want your cab for a while.\"\\n\\nIn a few words she told him of a woman lying on the steps of the house\\nnext to her--a woman whom she wished to befriend.\\n\\n\"I want you to take her to a certain place. I will tell you about it\\nwhen we start. Come quickly and help me to get her into your cab.\"\\n\\nThis was accomplished in less time than it takes to tell it.\\n\\n\"Where to, Nannie?\" asked the driver, as he picked up the reins.\\n\\n\"Why in the world are you taking her there?\" he exclaimed in dismay.\\n\\n\"Make no comments,\" she replied, angrily: \"but drive on as fast as you\\ncan. I wouldn\\'t take her there unless it was all right.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, of course,\" returned the driver. \"I am not saying but that you\\nknow what you\\'re doing. But she seems mighty quiet for that kind of a\\nperson.\"\\n\\nThey had scarcely turned the first corner ere Frank Garrick drove up in\\na cab.\\n\\n\"By thunder! she has vanished!\" he exclaimed, excitedly, looking in\\nastonishment at the spot where he had left her a short time before.\\n\"She must have fled into the house,\" he muttered. \"Well, cabby, here\\'s\\nyour fee, anyhow. You may as well go back.\"\\n\\nFor some moments Frank Garrick stood quite still and looked up at the\\nhouse.\\n\\n\"Of all places in the world, who would have expected to find her\\nhere--next door to Nannie. It\\'s certain that Nannie does not know\\nof it. She could not keep it if she did. Well, this is a pretty\\nhowdy-do--two rivals living next door to each other. Nannie is\\nexpecting me to call on her this evening. If it were not for that, I\\nwouldn\\'t show up at all, I\\'m so upset by that little beauty, Ida May.\"\\n\\nVery slowly he walked up the steps of the adjoining house and pulled\\nthe bell. To his great surprise, he learned that Nannie was out.\\n\\n\"She will be sure to be back presently,\" added the girl who answered\\nthe bell. \"Won\\'t you come in and wait?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" he answered, glad of the excuse. \"I\\'ll run in some evening during\\nthe week.\"\\n\\nWith that he turned on his heel and walked rapidly away.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the carriage bearing Nannie Rogers and the still unconscious\\nIda May rolled quickly onward, and stopped at length before a red-brick\\nbuilding on the outskirts of the city.\\n\\nIda May\\'s swoon lasted so long that even Nannie grew frightened.\\n\\n\"Wait,\" she said to the driver, \"I will have to step in first and see\\nif they will receive her.\"\\n\\nAfter fully five minutes had elapsed, the door opened and a tall man\\nlooked out.\\n\\n\"It is I, doctor,\" said Nannie Rogers. \"May I step inside? I want to\\nspeak to you. I have a patient waiting outside the gate.\"\\n\\n\"Dear me! is it really you? You come at rather a late hour. Still, you\\nknow you are a priviliged person here.\"\\n\\n\"I ought to be, since I have learned so many secrets about the place\\nand yourself,\" she said, \"when I was nurse here.\"\\n\\n\"Didn\\'t I give you five hundred dollars to insure secrecy when you left\\nhere?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I kept my promise. I never told anything, did I?\"\\n\\n\"Let me understand what you want,\" he said, abruptly. \"Did I understand\\nyou to say that there was a patient outside?\"\\n\\nThe girl nodded.\\n\\n\"It does not matter who or what she is,\" she said, tersely. \"It is the\\ndesire of her friends that she be kept here for a few months. I suppose\\nyou are anxious to know about the pay?\"\\n\\n\"Of course. That\\'s where my interest comes in,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Well, I will be responsible for it,\" she said.\\n\\n\"You?\" he said, amazedly.\\n\\n\"Yes; why not?\" she returned.\\n\\nHe looked at her with something like doubt.\\n\\n\"You dare not refuse to accept her!\" she declared.\\n\\n\"Do you mean that for a threat?\" he exclaimed, fiercely.\\n\\nShe shrugged her shoulders.\\n\\n\"I can not be held accountable for the way in which you take my\\nassertion,\" she declared.\\n\\nThe frown deepened on the man\\'s face.\\n\\n\"For convenience\\'s sake, we will say that the girl is an opium-eater,\\nand that is why you are keeping her under such strict surveillance.\"\\n\\nThe man muttered some strange, unintelligible remark.\\n\\n\"I suppose the cabman will help me in with the girl?\" he said, harshly.\\n\\n\"Of course,\" replied Nannie Rogers, impatiently.\\n\\nThe girl\\'s figure was so light that \"the doctor,\" as he termed himself,\\nfound little difficulty in bringing her into the house without aid.\\n\\nNannie Rogers stood in the hall-way, and followed him into the\\nreception room, where he laid the girl down upon a rude couch. She\\nwatched him as he threw back her long dark veil, and cried out in\\nwonder at the marvelous beauty of the still white face--the face so\\nlike chiseled marble.\\n\\n\"How young and how very lovely!\" he remarked; and as he spoke, he\\nunfolded the long dark cloak that enveloped her.\\n\\nA sharp exclamation broke from his lips, and he turned around suddenly.\\n\\n\"Nannie Rogers!\" he said.\\n\\nBut the look of astonishment that he saw on her face was as great as\\nhis own bore. Nannie Rogers\\' look of astonishment quickly gave way to\\none of the most intense hatred; ay, a very demon of rage seemed to have\\ntaken possession of her.\\n\\n\"I wonder that you brought her here,\" said the doctor.\\n\\nBut Nannie Rogers was speechless. She was gazing like one turned to\\nstone upon the face of the girl whom she believed to be her rival.\\n\\n\"I have a double reason for hating her now,\" she said, under her\\nbreath, clinching her hands so tightly that her nails cut deep into her\\npalms. But she did not even feel the pain.\\n\\n\"I say, I wonder that you brought her here,\" repeated the doctor.\\n\\n\"I knew of no better place,\" she replied, turning her eyes uneasily\\naway from him. \"You must not refuse to receive her.\"\\n\\n\"Who is she?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"I refuse to answer your question,\" she replied, grimly. \"You know only\\nthis about her: She is a confirmed opium-eater. One who is very much\\ninterested in her brought her here to be treated by you. She is to be\\nkept here, under strict watch, to prevent her getting away. If she\\nwrites any letters they are to be forwarded to me.\"\\n\\nAnd thus it happened that when Ida May opened her troubled eyes, after\\nthe doctor and an attendant had worked over her for upward of an hour,\\nshe found herself in a strange room, with strange faces bending over\\nher. She looked blankly up at them.\\n\\n\"The waves are very high,\" she moaned. \"Come back on the beach, girls,\"\\nshe murmured.\\n\\n\"She is out of her head,\" exclaimed the doctor, turning nervously to\\nhis attendant. \"I ought not to have taken this girl in,\" he continued,\\nin alarm. \"I fear we shall have no end of trouble with her. This looks\\nlike a long and lingering illness.\"\\n\\n\"She is so young, and as fair as a flower,\" murmured the attendant,\\nbending over her. \"I feel very sorry for her. If a fever should happen\\nto set in, do you think it would prove fatal to her?\" she asked,\\neagerly.\\n\\n\"In nine cases out of ten--yes,\" he replied, brusquely.\\n\\nAt the very hour that this conversation was taking place, Royal\\nAinsley, the scape-grace, was ascending the brown-stone steps of the\\nSt. John mansion.\\n\\n\"I will take beautiful Florence and her stately mamma to the ball\\nto-night,\" he mused, under his breath. \"Before we return, I will have\\nproposed to the haughty beauty. Trust me for that. They think I am\\nthe heir of my uncle, wealthy old Royal Ainsley, who died recently,\\nand--curse him!--left all his wealth to my gentlemanly cousin, even\\nmaking him change his name to that of Eugene Mallard, that the outside\\nworld might not confound it with mine. Yes, I will marry beautiful\\nFlorence St. John, and live a life of luxury!\"\\n\\nIn that moment there rose before his mental vision the sweet sad face\\nof beautiful Ida May, the fair young girl whom he had wronged so\\ncruelly and then deserted so heartlessly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIX.\\n\\n\\nThe servant who answered the bell at that moment, put a stop to Royal\\nAinsley\\'s musings.\\n\\nHe had only a few moments to wait in the drawing-room before Miss St.\\nJohn appeared.\\n\\nShe looked so lovely in her beautiful ball-dress that his eyes glowed\\nand his heart beat. Before he had an opportunity to utter the words\\nthat were on his lips, the young girl\\'s mother entered the drawing-room.\\n\\nShe was so gay and bright with him, that the mother wondered vaguely if\\nshe had forgotten the story which she had told concerning him.\\n\\nThe warning glance which she gave her daughter reminded her that she\\nmust act decorously.\\n\\nThe girl was very much in love, and it was easy enough for her to\\nforgive him for having had another sweetheart.\\n\\nHe accompanied mother and daughter to the grand ball. He was so gay and\\nso brilliant and so witty, that he charmed the beautiful Miss St. John\\nmore than ever, and he knew by her smiles that his efforts were not in\\nvain.\\n\\nAinsley was the very poetry of motion. It was a dream of delight to\\nFlorence St. John, as they made the round of the magnificent ball-room,\\nwith his arms clasped about her, his handsome face so near her own.\\n\\n\"Come into the conservatory, Florence,\" he whispered; \"I have something\\nto tell you.\"\\n\\nHow strange it was the scene and the occasion did not cause him to\\nremember that _other_ scene and that _other_ girl whom he had once\\nbrought into the conservatory to listen to words of burning love!\\n\\n\"Florence,\" he whispered, \"I have something to tell you. Will you\\nlisten to me?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" she said, her heart beating furiously, for, woman-like, she knew\\nwhat was coming. The lovely color on her cheeks deepened, the girl\\'s\\nblue eyes grew luminous and tender.\\n\\n\"Florence,\" he cried, \"how shall I tell you what I have to say? Oh,\\nFlorence, let me tell it quickly, lest my courage fail! I love you,\\ndear--love you as I have never loved any one in my life before!\"\\n\\nLooking into the dark, handsome face of the young man before her,\\nFlorence St. John saw that she was in the presence of a mighty\\npassion--a great love.\\n\\nIn an instant he was kneeling by her side, his whole soul in his eyes\\nand on his lips. It was the very first time in his life that Royal\\nAinsley\\'s heart was ever stirred with love.\\n\\nIf Florence St. John had even been poor, he would have cared for her.\\nHe started in first by wanting the girl for her money; it ended by his\\nwanting her for herself.\\n\\nHe caught the little hand in his that was carrying the beautiful\\nbouquet of roses he had sent her, and held it tightly.\\n\\n\"Thank Heaven!\" he said, \"the time has come at last, my beautiful love,\\nfor which I have waited so long. Surely you know what I have to tell\\nyou, Florence!\" he said, drawing back and looking at her.\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t the least idea,\" declared the girl, in whom the spirit of\\ncoquetry was strong. \"Really, I do not understand.\"\\n\\n\"There needs be no understanding, my beautiful love!\" he cried. \"None!\\nI have come to tell you in words what I have already told you a hundred\\ntimes in a hundred different ways--I love you with all my heart! I love\\nyou! I know no other words. There is none which can tell how dearly or\\nhow much all my heart, my soul, my life goes out in those few words--I\\nlove you!\"\\n\\nHis voice died away in a whisper.\\n\\n\"I have a true and serious friendship for you, Mr. Ainsley,\" she\\nanswered, coyly; \"but I--I have never thought of such a thing as love\\nor marriage.\"\\n\\n\"Will you think of it _now_?\" he answered, eagerly.\\n\\nHe loved her all the more for this sweet, womanly, modest hesitation.\\n\\nShe arose from the seat near the fountain where he had placed her.\\n\\n\"Well, let it rest in that way,\" she answered. \"I\\'ll refer the subject\\nto mamma; but you are not to say one word of love to me, nor speak to\\nher about the matter for at least two months.\"\\n\\n\"Florence, you are cruel,\" he cried, \"to keep me so long in suspense.\\nTell me, at least, that if your mother favors my suit, I may hope that\\nyou are not indifferent to me.\"\\n\\nBut she would not answer him. Her heart beat high, the fever of love\\nthrobbed in her veins; but, like all well-bred young girls, she had\\nbeen schooled by early training to make no sign of preference for\\nany man at his first avowal of affection. As he led her from the\\nconservatory, past the fountain, the fragrant water-lilies, past the\\ngreen palms and the flowering orchids, he gave a terrible start.\\n\\nIn that moment there came to him the memory of Ida May. He was annoyed\\nby the very thought of her in that hour, and he quickly put it from him.\\n\\nWhen they returned to the ball-room, Florence was as sweet as ever; but\\nneither by word or by sign did she betray any rememberance of the scene\\nwhich had just occurred in the conservatory.\\n\\nHe left Florence and her mother at the door of their home an hour\\nlater, but he did not have the opportunity of holding the little white\\nhand in his for one moment, or of holding even a word of conversation\\nwith her.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Mrs. St. John, when she and her daughter found themselves\\nalone for a moment, \"I saw him take you to the conservatory. You were\\ngone a long time. Did he propose?\"\\n\\n\"Yes!\" returned the girl, languidly.\\n\\n\"Yes!\" echoed Mrs. St. John. \"Why, how can you take it so calmly, my\\nFlorence? You accepted him, of course?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" returned the girl, calmly. \"I said that I would like to have two\\nmonths to consider the matter before the subject was broached to you.\"\\n\\n\"You are mad, Florence!\" cried her mother. \"A wealthy young man like\\nthat is not captured every day.\"\\n\\n\"We are not so poor, mamma, that I should make a god of wealth,\" said\\nthe girl.\\n\\n\"Oh, certainly not,\" said her mother; \"but I have always been afraid\\nyou would be sought after by some fortune-hunter.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XX.\\n\\n\\n\"I am sorry,\" said Mrs. St. John, after a moment\\'s pause, \"that you\\nhave refused to consider his suit for at least two months. Eligible\\nyoung men are not so plentiful nowadays that a young girl can be so\\nindependent.\"\\n\\n\"I need not ask _you_ what your opinion of an eligible young man is,\"\\nsaid the young girl, throwing back her head haughtily, \"for I know\\nyou would answer--a large bank account. But in _my_ opinion that does\\nnot constitute all, where the happiness of a life-time is at stake. I\\nwould rather marry a man whose reputation was spotless, if he did not\\nhave a second coat to his back. There is something more than money in\\nthis world to make our happiness. I am _glad_ instead of sorry that I\\nrefused to give him an answer for two months. I shall demand to know\\nwho the young girl is who came to our door, and what she is to him.\"\\n\\n\"Then you will be doing a very unwise thing,\" declared her mother,\\nemphatically. \"Let well enough alone. I told the girl to call around\\nto-morrow night, and when she comes I will have a talk with her.\"\\n\\n\"Will you permit me to be present at the interview, mamma?\"\\n\\n\"By no means!\" exclaimed Mrs. St. John, with asperity. \"The story that\\nno doubt will be unfolded to me is not for ears such as yours. I will\\ntell as much to you as I deem necessary for you to know; let that\\nsuffice.\"\\n\\nBut the young beauty and heiress was not to be appeased. She made up\\nher mind to see the girl at all hazards when she should come; but much\\nto the surprise of both mother and daughter, the girl did not put in an\\nappearance.\\n\\nThat day passed, as did also the next and the next. A week went by and\\nlengthened into a fortnight, and still the girl came not.\\n\\n\"You see, my dear, her statement was false!\" cried Mrs. St. John,\\ntriumphantly. \"She feared that we would investigate her story, and\\nshe was no doubt a fraud. If you believe all those strange stories\\nyou hear, you will have enough to do. She was no doubt looking for\\nhush-money, and when I did not offer to give it to her, you see she did\\nnot return.\"\\n\\nThis seemed quite the truth, as Florence saw it.\\n\\nHow wrong it had been to even suspect him! She made up her mind that if\\nhe should broach the subject before the time she had named, she might\\nnot refuse his pleading.\\n\\nShe was expecting him that very evening. He came at last, looking so\\nhandsome, so buoyant, that the girl\\'s heart went out to him at once,\\nas the hearts of so many women had done.\\n\\nHe brought her some beautiful violets, and he knew he had as good as\\nwon her when he saw her fasten them in the bodice of her dress.\\n\\nFlorence St. John was sitting in a velvet arm-chair but a short\\ndistance away. Her beautiful face was softened, more so than he had\\never seen it before, the smile on her lips was sweeter--the proud,\\nhalf-defiant, flashing loveliness seemed all at once to grow gentle.\\n\\nHe no longer seemed quite sure of her. It was Florence St. John\\'s\\nsilence that alarmed him, perhaps.\\n\\n\"I wish,\" he cried, \"that I knew in what words and in what fashion\\nother men make love.\"\\n\\n\"Does not your own heart teach you?\" asked the young girl, suddenly.\\n\\nHis face flushed at the question.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he answered; \"but I am not sure that the teachings are of the\\nright kind. You have not answered me, and it must be _my_ fault, either\\nbecause I have not expressed myself properly or that I have not made\\nmyself understood. Florence, I want you--with my whole heart I ask\\nyou--I want you to become my wife.\"\\n\\n\"Am I the first person you have ever told this to?\" she asked, slowly,\\nlooking him in the face.\\n\\nAlmost every girl he had ever made love to had asked him the same\\nquestion, and he was not abashed by it.\\n\\nThe ever-ready answer was on his lips instantly.\\n\\n\"How could you ever believe that I had spoken one word of love to any\\none but yourself,\" he said, reproachfully. \"No other face has ever had\\nthe slightest attraction for me. The men of my race have but one love\\nin a life-time. I have never loved before I met you. I shall love you\\nuntil I die. Are you answered?\"\\n\\nHe looked straight into her face as he uttered the falsehood.\\n\\nThere did sweep across his mind, as he uttered the falsehood, the\\nmemory of Ida May; but he put it from him quickly.\\n\\nHow strange it was that her memory should always haunt him, try hard as\\nhe would to banish it!\\n\\n\"You are quite sure that you never loved any girl but me?\" she repeated.\\n\\n\"_Quite_ sure,\" he responded. \"To doubt me causes me great pain,\\nFlorence.\"\\n\\n\"Then forget that I asked the question,\" she said, sweetly, believing\\nin him implicitly.\\n\\n\"And you will be mine?\" he whispered, holding the little hand closer.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" she answered, solemnly.\\n\\nHe caught her in his arms in a transport of delight.\\n\\n\"Thank you--thank you for those words, Ida!\" he cried.\\n\\n\"Did I understand you to call me _Ida_?\" she asked in wonder.\\n\\n\"No,\" he answered, boldly, cursing himself for the slip of the tongue.\\n\"I was about to add: \\'I do so thank you,\\' but you did not give me an\\nopportunity to finish the sentence.\"\\n\\nThe falsehood was so adroitly told that she believed him.\\n\\n\"I shall have to put a curb on my tongue, or Heaven knows what name I\\nshall be saying next.\"\\n\\nShould she tell him of the young girl who was at the door waiting to\\nsee him? She remembered her mother\\'s words the next moment, to say\\nnothing of the matter.\\n\\n\"Now that you have been so good as to consent to marry me, we are to\\nconsider ourselves engaged. The question is, when will you marry me? It\\nmay as well be _soon_ as late.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I really don\\'t know about that now,\" she declared.\\n\\n\"Make me happy by saying that it will be as soon as possible,\" he urged.\\n\\nThere was no denying anything he asked in that winsome voice.\\n\\n\"I promise,\" she repeated, after another pause.\\n\\nHe caught her in his arms and strained her to his bosom.\\n\\n\"You have made me the happiest man in the whole wide world, Florence!\"\\nhe cried, rapturously.\\n\\nSuddenly his arms fell from her and he reeled backward, staring at the\\nwindow with widely dilated eyes.\\n\\n\"What is the matter, Royal? Are you ill?\" cried Florence, in the\\ngreatest terror.\\n\\n\"Some one passed along the porch just outside the window,\" he\\npanted--\"a woman hurrying toward the vestibule door. She will ring the\\nbell in a moment!\" he gasped.\\n\\nAt that instant there was a heavy peal at the front door bell.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXI.\\n\\n\\n\"Florence,\" repeated Royal Ainsley, his face white as death, his teeth\\nchattering, \"order the servants not to answer the bell!\"\\n\\nBut it was too late; the door had already swung back on its hinges. An\\ninstant later the servant appeared with a card.\\n\\n\"A gentleman, miss,\" he said. \"I told him you were not at home, as you\\nrequested.\"\\n\\nFlorence St. John held the card in her white fingers.\\n\\n\"You see, it was not a lady,\" she said, half amused at his agitation.\\n\\nHe drew a breath of intense relief.\\n\\n\"Pardon me, Florence,\" he said. \"I--I--thought it was one of your girl\\nfriends who was about to share your attention with me. I gave way to my\\nannoyance. Be kind, and forget it. Remember the old adage: \\'One finds\\nmuch to pardon in a man who is in love.\\'\"\\n\\nHis explanation of the matter satisfied her. Very young girls are\\nnever suspicious. The remembrance of that one evening always stood\\nout bright and clear in Florence St. John\\'s life. She gave herself\\nup to happiness, and when Royal urged her to name an early day, she\\nlaughingly consented.\\n\\n\"All the ladies in our family have been married in April,\" she declared.\\n\\n\"That is almost four months from now, my darling,\" he groaned. \"Do not\\nask me to wait so long. So much might take place within that time!\"\\n\\nHe was about to add \"to part us,\" but stopped himself just in time.\\n\\n\"A lady has to have a _trousseau_ prepared,\" she said, archly. \"And\\nwhen you put yourself in the hands of these _modistes_, you are at\\ntheir mercy; they will not be hurried. Mamma, I am sure, would not\\nconsent to an earlier marriage than that. I hope that I may persuade\\nher to do so.\"\\n\\n\"You will allow me to persuade her differently, if I can?\" he asked,\\neagerly.\\n\\n\"Yes, if you can,\" she answered.\\n\\n\"I will try to settle it before I leave the house this very night,\"\\nhe declared. \"Ah, here comes your mother now! If you will make some\\nkind of an excuse to absent yourself from the room, my darling, for a\\nfew moments, I will urge my suit so eloquently that she will find it\\ndifficult to say \\'no\\' to me.\"\\n\\nMrs. St. John greeted the young man pleasantly as she entered. She was\\ntoo thoroughly a woman of the world to greet him effusively, knowing,\\nhad she done so, it would be sure to make him too confident of success.\\n\\nRoyal Ainsley laid himself out to please the mother as he had never\\nattempted to please an elderly woman before.\\n\\n\"You asked me to play over a new piece of music for you when you\\ncame. If you will please excuse me for a moment, I will get it,\" said\\nFlorence, glancing up shyly at him with laughing eyes, as much as to\\nsay, \"I am going to give you a chance for the longed-for interview with\\nmamma\"--a look which Royal Ainsley answered with a nod. Florence had\\nscarcely reached the upper landing ere Royal Ainsley left his seat, and\\nwalked eagerly over to Mrs. St. John\\'s side.\\n\\n\"My dear lady,\" he began, dropping into a seat opposite her, \"I want\\nto tell you a little story and hear your opinion about it.\"\\n\\nMrs. St. John was wise enough to know what was coming, but she did not\\nbetray more than the usual interest.\\n\\n\"It is the story of a young man who wished to possess a treasure which\\nbelonged to another. He yearned for it with all his soul.\\n\\n\"My dear lady, not to beat further round the bush, let me say I am the\\nyoung man who wishes to possess the treasure which you hold as sacred.\\nThat treasure is your beautiful daughter Florence, my dear lady. I love\\nher with all my heart. I want your consent to make her my wife.\"\\n\\n\"Dear, dear me!\" exclaimed Mrs. St. John, apparently greatly\\nfrustrated. \"I hope you have not spoken a word of this to the dear\\nchild.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I have, and we have both determined to abide by your decision, as\\nto how long we shall have to wait, though we both hope you will set as\\nearly a day as possible.\"\\n\\n\"Remember that my Florence is only a school-girl yet,\" declared the\\nmother. \"I could not think of parting from her yet.\"\\n\\n\"Dear, dear lady!\" cried Royal Ainsley, \"do not doom me to such pitiful\\nsuspense, I beg of you! There are some men who could wait with much\\npatience, but I am not one of them. I should have to go away and travel\\nincessantly.\"\\n\\nThis was exactly what Mrs. St. John did not wish to happen. The gilded\\nyouth before her was too good a catch in the matrimonial market to lose.\\n\\nEvery mother is always glad to have her daughter make a good match. She\\nwas no exception to the rule.\\n\\nAnd when she read in the paper, a few months later, of that uncle\\'s\\ndeath, and that he had left his vast wealth to his nephew, Royal\\nAinsley, she was determined that no effort should be spared to make him\\nfall in love with her daughter.\\n\\nHe grew eloquent in his pleading. Ere ten minutes more had elapsed, he\\nhad drawn from Mrs. St. John\\'s lips the promise that the wedding should\\ntake place in four months\\' time at the very latest.\\n\\nHe made up his mind to accept this decision for the present, but he\\nwould certainly depend upon his own eloquence and persuasive powers in\\nthe near future to overcome her scruples and influence her to name an\\nearlier day.\\n\\nHe left the house that night buoyant of spirits and gay of heart. It\\nwas strange that in that hour he thought of Ida May.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXII.\\n\\n\\nWe must now return to Ida May, dear reader, and the thrilling\\nexperiences the poor girl was passing through in the lonely stone house\\non the river-road.\\n\\nOwing to the drug which was being constantly administered to her, from\\nthe hour she crossed the threshold Ida knew little or nothing of what\\nwas going on in the outside world.\\n\\nThe days lengthened into weeks, and the weeks into months.\\n\\nHer remittances came regularly; still, the \"doctor\" of the sanitarium\\nwas heartily sick of his bargain. He dared not refuse Nannie Rogers\\'\\nrequest to keep her there, for reasons which would put him behind the\\nprison bars had they reached the ears of the authorities.\\n\\nWhen he saw the girl grow whiter and more fragile with each passing\\nday, his alarm increased.\\n\\nIn this horrible place Ida May wore out four long and weary months of\\nher young life.\\n\\nThey had long since ceased giving her the drug. It was unnecessary now\\nto waste any more of it upon her.\\n\\nWhen Ida May\\'s mind slowly cleared, and a realization of what was going\\non about her came to her, she looked in the greatest astonishment at\\nthe strange apartment and the grim-faced woman who was bringing food\\nto her.\\n\\n\"Where am I, and who are you?\" she asked. \"Oh, I remember! I swooned on\\nthe steps of the boarding-house. Did _he_ have me brought here?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" retorted the doctor\\'s sister, thinking that the better way of\\nstopping all questioning.\\n\\nA bitter cry of horror rose to Ida May\\'s lips.\\n\\n\"Then I must go away from here at once!\" she declared, attempting to\\ngain her feet.\\n\\nBut she was so weak that she staggered and would have fallen had not\\nthe woman sprung forward and saved her.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t go on in that way,\" said the woman, brusquely. \"You are to\\nremain here until you are--well. It won\\'t be over a fortnight longer.\\nYou\\'ve been here some time.\"\\n\\n\"But I _will not_ remain here!\" exclaimed Ida May, excitedly. \"I shall\\nleave at once!\"\\n\\nThe woman turned the key in the lock, coolly removed it, and slipping\\nit into her pocket, remarked:\\n\\n\"This is a sanitarium. It is not for patients to say when they shall\\nleave here. _That_ is the doctor\\'s business.\"\\n\\n\"But tell me, why does any one wish to keep me here?\" cried Ida May,\\npiteously. \"No one in the whole world has any interest in me.\"\\n\\n\"I am surprised to hear you say that,\" declared the woman, grimly, with\\nsomething very much like a sneer in her harsh voice.\\n\\nThe words, the tone in which they were uttered, and the look which\\naccompanied them, cut the poor girl to the heart.\\n\\n\"Let me tell you about the man who brought me here,\" cried Ida,\\ntrembling like a leaf, believing it must certainly be her sworn enemy,\\nFrank Garrick, who had taken cruelly taken advantage of her to abduct\\nher when she swooned on the boarding-house stoop.\\n\\n\"I have no time to listen to you,\" exclaimed the woman. \"We are\\nstrictly forbidden to talk to the patients or listen to their tales of\\nwoe, which are always woven out of whole cloth.\"\\n\\n\"You are a woman like myself,\" cried Ida May, sobbing bitterly. \"Surely\\nyou can not find it in your heart to turn a deaf ear to me, for pity\\'s\\nsake, if for nothing else.\"\\n\\nBut the woman was inexorable, and said:\\n\\n\"I tell you, I don\\'t want to hear what you have got to say--and I\\n_won\\'t_, that\\'s all about it. If you make any fuss, you will be put on\\na diet of bread and water.\"\\n\\n\"But answer me this one question,\" said Ida May, in terror. \"What\\nreason has any one in keeping me here against my will?\"\\n\\nThe woman shrugged her shoulders.\\n\\n\"There may be plenty of reasons,\" she retorted, sharply. \"Perhaps you\\nare a wife that some man wants to be rid of. Then, again, perhaps you\\nare no wife--a better reason still for some young man wishing to get\\nyou safely out of his path just now. A father or a brother may have\\nbrought you here to save the family honor. I could go on with any\\namount of practical reasons.\"\\n\\n\"Have I not told you that I am all alone in the world?\" panted the poor\\ngirl, clinging to her with death-cold hands.\\n\\n\"Yes; but I have good reason to think otherwise,\" replied the woman,\\nbluntly. \"There\\'s no use in your making a fuss,\" continued the woman,\\nharshly. \"You may have to put in a long time beneath this roof.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIII.\\n\\n\\nLong hours after the woman left the room, Ida May sat by the window\\nlooking out into the darkness, and trying to fathom what seemed to her\\nthe greatest kind of a mystery.\\n\\nWhy should Frank Garrick take interest enough in her to have her\\nbrought here and to pay money for having her retained here? What\\ninterest could he have in her?\\n\\nHe had vowed a terrible vengeance upon her when she repulsed his offer\\nof love. But why should his vengeance have taken this form? What\\nbenefit could it be to him to shut her in from the world?\\n\\nAs Ida sat there in the waning light, her eyes fell upon a piece of\\nnewspaper in the open fire-place.\\n\\n\"I will wrap up my few belongings in that,\" she muttered, \"and then set\\nabout making my way out of this place.\"\\n\\nAs she smoothed out the half sheet, a few lines midway down one of the\\ncolumns held her spell-bound as they caught her eye.\\n\\nFor a moment she stared at the words. They seemed to fairly turn the\\nheart in her bosom to stone, for they read as follows:\\n\\n \"The engagement is announced of Miss Florence St. John, of No. --,\\n Fifth Avenue, daughter of Mrs. J. St. John, to Mr. Royal Ainsley, of\\n New York. The wedding will take place at Peekskill, on the Hudson, a\\n month from date.\"\\n\\nAs she read it, the room seemed to whirl around her. With a cry so\\npiteous that it seemed it must reach God\\'s ear, the poor girl sunk on\\nher knees.\\n\\nHer husband about to marry another!\\n\\nNo matter what the world might say, she had married him in good faith.\\nHe was hers; he belonged to her before Heaven and all the world.\\n\\nShe wrung her hands wildly.\\n\\n\"The marriage must not take place! I must save the man I love from\\nhimself and the anger of the watching angels!\" she cried.\\n\\nShe prayed wildly that she might not be too late.\\n\\nHer hat and cloak were hanging on a peg near the door. She took them\\ndown, and her hands trembled so that she could hardly put them on. Her\\nknees trembled, and she felt faint. But she summoned all her strength,\\nand reached the door and turned the knob. But it was locked on the\\noutside.\\n\\nHer weak hands were powerless to force the door. She crept back to the\\nwindow and threw open the sash. All that she could behold was a dense\\nmass of trees.\\n\\nA sturdy oak grew close to the window, its great branches spread out\\ninvitingly before her. It was a desperate chance to take in order to\\nreach the ground, which was fully thirty feet below.\\n\\nWould her strength give way? Dare she take the terrible risk?\\n\\n\"I must! I must!\" she cried. \"Heaven will protect me!\"\\n\\nWithout stopping to debate the matter further, lest she should lose\\ncourage, the poor girl climbed with difficulty out on the broad sill\\nand grasped one of the boughs.\\n\\nWould it bear her weight?\\n\\nThe great bough creaked with its unaccustomed weight, slight as it was,\\nthen shot downward.\\n\\nIn the old days at home Ida May had been accustomed to climb trees and\\nto swing about in their branches. She realized that when the bough bent\\nits entire length earthward she must let go her hold, or it would carry\\nher quickly up again. She let go her hold when she felt that the bough\\nof the tree had bent to its utmost. Quickly she fell downward, and Ida\\nMay, stunned and helpless for a moment, found herself lying in the long\\ngreen grass.\\n\\nShe had scarcely fallen three feet, yet the shock had stunned her.\\n\\nShe knew that she must be on some country road. Afar in the distance\\nshe could distinctly see rows of glimmering lights. Those she knew must\\nbe the lights of the city. She must reach it and find the house on\\nFifth Avenue before she dared give herself a moment\\'s rest.\\n\\nShe reached the outskirts of the city at last, and crept on toward its\\ngreat throbbing heart.\\n\\nLike one in a dream, Ida May saw a tall, thin woman and a young girl,\\nwho appeared to be her maid, step from a carriage.\\n\\nShe tried to get out of their way, but if her very life had depended\\nupon it, she could not have done so. The tall woman and Ida May jostled\\nagainst each other.\\n\\nWith a sharp exclamation of anger, the lady turned upon her. But at\\nthat moment Ida reeled, and, with a piteous moan, fell senseless at her\\nfeet.\\n\\n\"Well, well! here\\'s a pretty howdy-do!\" exclaimed the tall, angular\\nwoman. \"Here, John!\" she called to the footman, who was just shutting\\nthe door of the vehicle, \"pick up this poor creature, and carry her\\ninto the house. It appears I have knocked her down. I hope no bones are\\nbroken.\"\\n\\nThe house into which Ida May was carried was a very small cottage,\\noccupied by a poor laborer and his wife, who were the parents of a\\nlittle one who was ill but was slowly convalescing.\\n\\nThe wealthy spinster and her maid often called to bring some fruit or\\nmedicine to the child.\\n\\nMiss Fernly was not fair to look upon, but she had a heart of gold. She\\nwas quite eccentric; but her purse was always open to the wants of the\\nneedy.\\n\\n\"Leave the room instantly,\" she said to her maid. \"Run out and tell the\\ncoachman to go for the nearest doctor, and to fetch him back with him\\nat once!\"\\n\\nIt seemed an age until the doctor arrived. Everything in human power\\nwas done to render the sufferer comfortable.\\n\\nIt was early morn when the doctor departed--and there had come into\\nthis great world of sorrow a dark-eyed little stranger--a tiny little\\none, with a lovely face like its mother\\'s.\\n\\n\"Will it live?\" cried the young mother, as she listened breathlessly to\\nits faint little wails.\\n\\n\"I am afraid not,\" replied the doctor pityingly. \"We can only hope.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, if it would only die--only die!\" sobbed the girl\\'s mother. \"The\\nworld is so cold and so dark!\"\\n\\nMiss Fernly drew back, shocked and pained.\\n\\n\"You must not wish for anything like that to happen,\" she said, \"for\\nGod might take you at your word.\"\\n\\nFor ten long and weary days the hapless young mother lay with her face\\nto the wall, crying out to Heaven to take her and her baby from this\\ncruel world.\\n\\nIn great fear, the doctor had taken charge of the little one, and\\nconveyed it to a near-by foundling asylum. Its presence seemed to\\nirritate the hapless young mother, who was already in a high fever.\\n\\nMiss Fernly called every day at the cottage, to see how her latest\\ncharge was progressing.\\n\\nShe had taken a strange interest in the girl whose identity seemed\\nshrouded in such profound mystery.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIV.\\n\\n\\nThe beautiful girl lying so ill under Miss Fernly\\'s care grew steadily\\nworse. Her constant cry for the little one was most pitiful to hear.\\n\\n\"How are we to let her know that it is slowly fading away?\" said the\\nwoman to the doctor.\\n\\n\"We will not let her know until the last moment; it would do her no\\ngood, and be only a setback for her,\" he responded.\\n\\nMiss Fernly pitied the young mother from the very depths of her heart.\\nIt made this spinster more than ever enraged at men. She had tried to\\ngain the girl\\'s confidence. But it had all been in vain. Ida would lie\\nfor hours, looking out of the window at the fleecy clouds, muttering\\npiteously:\\n\\n\"It must have taken place by this time! Oh! I am too late, too late!\"\\n\\nAt last Miss Fernly\\'s curiosity got the better of her.\\n\\n\"Will you tell me what you mean by those words, my dear?\" she asked,\\none day. \"Perhaps I can help you in some way.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" returned Ida May, wearily. \"It would be useless, useless.\"\\n\\nMiss Fernly took the little white hand in her own and pressed it gently.\\n\\n\"Do not say that, my dear, and in that tone; it is not right. Heaven is\\nalways kind enough to send a friend to those who are in need of help.\"\\n\\n\"You are right,\" said the girl, quickly. \"In my life I have been used\\nto cruelty and unkindness. I--I--\"\\n\\nShe stopped for a moment, and something like a flush crossed her pale\\ncheeks; then she burst into tears.\\n\\n\"I will tell you my story, my good lady,\" she sobbed; \"for the weight\\nof it is eating my soul away.\"\\n\\nWith her throbbing little hands still held tightly in Miss Fernly\\'s,\\nshe sobbed wretchedly:\\n\\n\"Surely it is the cruelest story that ever a young girl had to tell. I\\nmight have led a happy life if I had not been foolish enough to want\\nto be a fine lady. I had often read of such things happening, and oh!\\nI believed it. Cinderella was changed from a kitchen-maid to a fairy\\nprincess, and oh! how happy she was, if but for a brief hour.\\n\\n\"It seemed to me that an opportunity always came for those who watched\\nfor it. One came to me. A wealthy family took me with them to Newport\\nfor the summer, and there I met a young man fair of face, handsome\\nas a dream. I had never before seen any one like him. You will not\\nwonder that my heart went out to him. I had known him but a few short\\nweeks ere he asked me to marry him, counseling a secret marriage, and\\nI--I consented. It was not a regular minister who married us, but\\na--a--mayor, or somebody like that.\\n\\n\"My husband brought me to the city. We had barely reached here, after\\nan all-night\\'s journey, when I learned to my horror that he believed me\\nto be the heiress of the wealthy people with whom I had been stopping.\\nWhen I told him I was not, what a change there came over him! With a\\nface as white as it would ever be in death, he drew back and looked at\\nme.\\n\\n\"\\'Not an heiress?\\' he cried. \\'Great heavens! what an eternal fool I\\nhave made of myself!\\'\\n\\n\"He left my presence quickly, telling me that it was all a\\nmistake--that the man who had married us had not the power to do so;\\nthat it was just as well, perhaps, for he never could wed a poor girl.\\n\\n\"He advised me to go home and forget him, adding insult to injury by\\nconcluding with the cruel words; \\'Such a little incident in the life of\\na working-girl will not amount to anything.\\'\"\\n\\n\"The scoundrel of a man!\" cried Miss Fernly, in intense indignation. \"I\\nwonder that a righteous God lets such men live!\"\\n\\nShe found herself intensely interested in the story of this beautiful\\nyoung girl, whose innocent face she could not help but trust from the\\nfirst moment that she beheld it.\\n\\nAt first it had occurred to Miss Fernly to ask the name of the rascal,\\nher husband; then she told herself that in all probability it was a\\nfalse one, and that he could not be traced by it.\\n\\n\"I will think the matter over,\" said Miss Fernly, \"and conclude what\\naction you should take. For your child\\'s sake, you can not allow this\\nman to go free. You would be committing a crime against society at\\nlarge.\"\\n\\nJust at that moment the doctor entered the room. He motioned Miss\\nFernly to one side. By some strange intuition, Ida May guessed the\\nimport of his visit.\\n\\n\"My--my little one!\" she cried, inquiringly--\"tell me of her! How is\\nshe?\"\\n\\nFor a moment the doctor was silent.\\n\\n\"I may as well tell the truth now as tell it at some future time,\" he\\nthought, pityingly.\\n\\n\"Tell me what news do you bring of my little child?\" cried Ida.\\n\\nHe crossed over to where the hapless young girl sat, and bent over her\\npityingly.\\n\\n\"The little one is dead!\" he said in a low, hushed voice.\\n\\nIt was dying when he left the foundling asylum. As he gazed upon it,\\nhe said to himself that it would be but a question of a few short\\nhours. He turned away from it, leaving it in the care of the good\\nnurses, that he might go and gently break the sad news to the young\\nmother.\\n\\nWhile Miss Fernly and the hapless young mother were discussing the\\nflowers they would plant over baby\\'s grave, the nurses, with bated\\nbreath, were standing around the little cot. Another physician sat by\\nthe cot, holding the waxen wrist.\\n\\n\"Quick! hand me the cordial!\" he cried. \"I may be able to save this\\nlittle life!\"\\n\\nA small vial was hurriedly handed to him. He poured a few drops between\\nthe white lips, and sat down again, patiently awaiting the result.\\n\\n\"If the infant lives five minutes, it will be able to pull through,\" he\\nobserved, quietly.\\n\\nThey watched the great clock on the opposite wall, whose pendulum swung\\nnoiselessly to and fro. One minute, two; there was no change. A third;\\nthe doctor bent his ear to listen for the feeble breathing, holding a\\nmirror close to the child\\'s lips. There was moisture upon it as he drew\\nit away. Another moment, the crucial moment, was reached.\\n\\n\"See! it is dying!\" whispered one of the nurses, touching the doctor\\'s\\narm.\\n\\nA half minute more, and then another half minute passed by.\\n\\n\"The baby will live!\" exclaimed the doctor, rising to his feet. \"Yes,\\nthe baby will live,\" repeated the doctor. \"It has had a hard time of\\nit, I see, but it has conquered death.\\n\\n\"It is so strange,\" he mused, \"whom nobody wants or seems to care for\\nclings to life most tenaciously, as though it were worth having.\\n\\n\"A few hours since I was at the home of one of the wealthiest families\\nin the city. That young mother\\'s babe died, though I did everything\\nin human power to save it. The father caught me by the arm when I was\\nfirst called there, and said:\\n\\n\"\\'Doctor, save that little child upstairs, and it will be the making of\\nyour fortune. You shall name your own price. Stay right here, by night\\nand by day, until it is out of danger, and anything you may ask for\\nshall be yours.\\'\\n\\n\"He led me through the marble hall and past gilded drawing-rooms and\\nspacious parlors to the chamber above where mother and child lay. It\\nwas a plump little mite, with everything to live for. I thought my task\\nwould be an easy one; but you have heard the old saying: \\'Man proposes,\\nbut God disposes.\\'\\n\\n\"Well it was so in this case. It had only the measles--a disease which\\nevery little one has at some time during infancy. No wonder I felt no\\nalarm.\\n\\n\"Although I did my best, it began to fail. I summoned all the experts\\nin the city, bringing together men who were older and wiser than\\nmyself, to discover what could possibly be the reason why my skill had\\nfailed me in this instance.\\n\\n\"There was nothing which science could suggest that we did not do. But\\nit seemed that fate was against us. The child literally faded before\\nour very eyes, and passed away.\\n\\n\"This one had no such chance of life as the other had, yet it has\\npassed through an illness so dangerous that not one in a thousand ever\\nlive through. I predict that it will have an uncommon future,\" he\\nadded, thoughtfully.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXV.\\n\\n\\nFor long hours after the doctor had left Ida May, she wept so bitterly\\nover the fate of her little child that Miss Fernly grew alarmed.\\n\\n\"Crying will not bring the baby back,\" she said. \"The Almighty knew\\nbest whether He wanted it to live or die. You must not rail against the\\njudgment of God!\"\\n\\nShe felt that she must draw her mind into another channel.\\n\\n\"Say that you will be more composed when I see you again,\" she replied,\\nearnestly, \"though it may not be for some days.\"\\n\\n\"I will try,\" murmured Ida May, with a sigh. \"Will it be long before I\\nsee you?\" she added, wistfully.\\n\\n\"I am going to my niece\\'s wedding,\" answered Miss Fernly. \"I may remain\\na few days after at the house.\"\\n\\nIda May drew a long, deep sob.\\n\\n\"How strange the word \\'marriage\\' sounds to me now,\" she moaned. \"When I\\nhear of a young girl\\'s marriage nowadays, I earnestly pray Heaven that\\nher husband may not deceive her!\"\\n\\n\"I am sure that there need be nothing to fear in _this_ instance,\" said\\nMiss Fernly. \"My niece sent me her _fiance\\'s_ picture this morning. He\\nseems to be a noble young fellow. By the way, I will show it to you,\"\\nshe added, still believing that the one thing needful was to divert the\\ngirl\\'s mind.\\n\\nThoughtless as to what would accrue from her action, Miss Fernly drew a\\nsmall case from her pocket and touched the spring.\\n\\nThe lid flew back, disclosing a magnificent affair in ivory--the\\nportrait of a young and handsome man.\\n\\n\"He has an honest look in his eyes, and a fair, open countenance,\" said\\nMiss Fernly. \"It was painted three years ago.\"\\n\\nAs she uttered the words, she handed the portrait to Ida May.\\n\\nOne glance, then a cry of the wildest horror broke from the girl\\'s\\nwhite, terrified lips.\\n\\n\"God have mercy!\" she gasped, \"it is he!\"\\n\\nMiss Fernly sprung to her feet, quite as white and terrified as Ida.\\n\\n\"You--you do not mean to say that this is the man who wrought all your\\nwoe?\" she cried, in horror too great for words.\\n\\n\"Yes!\" cried Ida May, springing to her feet, and crying out: \"I swear\\nto you that this is Royal Ainsley, the man whom I wedded, and who\\ndeserted me! This is the father of my little dead babe!\"\\n\\nThe expression upon Miss Fernly\\'s face was horrible to see.\\n\\nShe rose in awful wrath and struck her hands sharply together as she\\nturned and faced the girl.\\n\\n\"It was fate that sent you across my path,\" she exclaimed, hoarsely.\\n\"But for this timely intervention my innocent niece would have wedded\\nthat villain on the morrow. But I thank Heaven that I am now able to\\nprevent it, and to avenge you as well, my poor child. Ah!\" she cried,\\nas a sudden thought flashed through her mind, \"an idea has come to\\nme, by which I can not only wreak my vengeance upon him, but mete out\\njustice to you as well.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no, no; do not do anything to harm him!\" cried Ida May, in terror.\\n\"Cruel as he has been to me, I love him still, and I shall always love\\nhim!\"\\n\\n\"What I intend to do will not harm him. I repeat that it will right\\nyour wrong,\" she added, grimly. \"There shall be a wedding to-morrow,\\nmy poor, unfortunate girl. But listen to me well, and heed what I\\nsay--_you_ shall be this man\\'s bride to-morrow, instead of my niece.\\nLeave everything to me.\"\\n\\nShe gathered up her wrap and gloves and put them on.\\n\\n\"I shall have a great deal to do between now and nightfall. But this I\\nsay to you, Ida May: Be ready to go with me when I shall come for you.\\nIt may be to-night, perhaps to-morrow night. Ask me no questions now,\\nbut trust in me implicitly. Since the hour I came across you in your\\nmisfortune, you have found me a good friend to you, Ida May, have you\\nnot?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" sobbed Ida May, wretchedly. \"I--I--would have perished in the\\nstreet but for you, noble lady. I respect and have all confidence in\\nyou.\"\\n\\n\"Then by that confidence do as I bid you,\" repeated Miss Fernly. \"I\\nwill send some clothing for you to wear. Wrap about you the long, dark\\ncloak you wore in coming here, and be in readiness.\"\\n\\nWith these words, Miss Fernly fairly flew from the cottage.\\n\\nIda May sunk back in her chair, pale and excited.\\n\\n\"Why should the announcement that he is to be married to-morrow have\\nshocked me?\" she moaned. \"I had every reason to expect that would occur\\nany day after I read it myself in the paper.\"\\n\\nShe did not sob or cry out. It seemed to Ida that the very heart within\\nher was crushed. She had borne so much that it appeared there was\\nnothing more left for her to endure.\\n\\nMiss Fernly was thankful beyond words that she had not brought her maid\\nwith her on her last visit.\\n\\nIn all possible haste she hurried to the magnificent home of her sister\\non Riverside Drive.\\n\\nAlthough living in the same city, the married sister saw very little of\\nMiss Fernly, the latter devoted so much of her time to charity. She had\\nnot been to the house but once since Mrs. Cramer had written to her of\\nher daughter Hildegarde, and that she was soon to be married.\\n\\nHildegarde was delighted when she looked out and saw her aunt drive up.\\n\\n\"What a surprise, dear aunt!\" she cried, throwing her white arms about\\nher. \"Mamma and I were just speaking of you. I was almost afraid that\\nyou had forgotten the date set for the wedding. And just to think you\\nhave never met my intended, and he so anxious to see the darling aunt\\nI have always been talking of! I want you to see him, he is so lovely.\\nBut what did you think of the picture?\" rattled on Hildegarde, in her\\ngay, girlish fashion, without giving the other a chance to answer.\\n\\n\"You are very, very much in love with him?\" asked Miss Fernly,\\nanxiously.\\n\\n\"Why shouldn\\'t I be?\" cried the girl, blushing as red as a rose, and\\nhiding her peachy face against her aunt\\'s broad shoulder. \"No girl\\never had a more devoted lover.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, it is plainly to be seen that you do love him,\" said Miss Fernly,\\nsternly.\\n\\n\"I do not know what to tell you about him, auntie, except that he is\\nthe dearest fellow in all the world, and just adores me; at least, that\\nis what he tells me,\" said Hildegarde.\\n\\n\"Humph!\" ejaculated Miss Fernly.\\n\\n\"I would rather you would see him for yourself, then you could form\\nyour own opinion. He will be here this evening. I am sure you will like\\nhim.\"\\n\\n\"At what time do you expect him!\" asked Miss Fernly, with unusual\\ninterest.\\n\\n\"Let me answer you in the words of the song,\" said Hildegarde, laughing\\nlightly.\\n\\n     \"\\'Somebody\\'s coming when the dew-drops fall.\\'\"\\n\\n\"Do not be silly, Hildegarde,\" said her aunt, sharply.\\n\\n\"I asked you what time this young man is to call here this evening.\"\\n\\n\"It is generally half past seven when he arrives,\" said Miss Cramer,\\nsmiling mischievously.\\n\\n\"Very well,\" said Miss Fernly. \"When he calls, I will go down into the\\nparlor and interview him.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m sure he would be most delighted,\" returned the young girl,\\ndemurely.\\n\\n\"That\\'s neither here nor there,\" returned Miss Fernly. \"I do not care\\nwhether he likes me or not.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVI.\\n\\n\\nMiss Fernly had made her resolution. She would interview this man when\\nhe came. She would foil him, this fiend in human form, who would wed\\none young and lovely girl after bringing sorrow to another.\\n\\nWhen Miss Fernly made up her mind to a course, nothing could change it.\\n\\n\"What I am about to do is for Hildegarde\\'s good,\" she told herself\\ngrimly. \"There will be a few tears at first, but the time will come\\nwhen she will thank me with all her heart for saving her from such a\\nconsummate rascal. The woman of our race have never forgiven men who\\nhave deceived other women. Hildegarde should not be an exception to the\\nrule. She is young now, but when she comes to know more about life she\\nwill thank me for saving her.\"\\n\\n\"Now,\" said her aunt, aloud, depositing herself in the nearest chair,\\nand deliberately removing her hat and mantle, \"tell me about this\\nsweetheart of yours.\"\\n\\nHildegarde came over to the hassock and flung herself down upon it and\\nlooked up with laughing eyes into her aunt\\'s face.\\n\\n\"I sent you his picture,\" she said, \"because you did not seem inclined\\nto come here to meet him, auntie, so that you could see for yourself\\njust how he looks. But it does not do him justice,\" went on Hildegarde,\\nclasping her hands. \"That portrait does not tell you how good and noble\\nhe is, and how much he thinks of me!\"\\n\\nAn expression that was almost divine came over the face of Hildegarde\\nCramer as she uttered the words in a low, sweet voice.\\n\\n\"Tell me about him,\" again urged her aunt, anxious to fathom just how\\ndeep was the love the girl bore him.\\n\\nShould she confide in Hildegarde the story of Ida May, Miss Fernly knew\\nthat the present state of affairs must end.\\n\\nThere were girls who would turn in horror from a man who had done\\nas cruel a deed as that which was laid at the door of the man whom\\nHildegarde was about to marry. But might not Hildegarde cling to him\\ndespite all?\\n\\n\"He is all that is noble,\" continued Hildegarde, dreamily.\\n\\n\"What if he should cease to love you?\" said her aunt.\\n\\nHildegarde started; a quiver of pain passed over the lovely face.\\n\\n\"Cease to love me!\" she repeated. \"Ah! do you know what would happen to\\nme, auntie, if that were to occur? I should die, that is all. When all\\nwas gone that made life worth living, how could I live?\"\\n\\n\"It is not easy to die,\" said Miss Fernly, huskily.\\n\\n\"It would be easy for me,\" declared Hildegarde.\\n\\n\"One can not live without a heart, and I have given mine to my love.\"\\n\\nShe continued to talk of her lover in a sweet, girlish fashion; but\\nMiss Fernly scarcely heard a word she said, she was so engrossed in her\\nown thoughts and plans.\\n\\n\"You would be so glad if you knew just how perfectly happy I am,\\nauntie,\" she went on, in a half-dreamy fashion. \"Why, it doesn\\'t seem\\nthe same world to me. He came into my life as the sun breaks upon the\\nflowers, suddenly, swiftly, and all at once my life became complete. I\\nmet him on board the steamer. I shall never forget how it came about.\\nI had just come upon deck, and was about to walk to the railing, when\\nthe ship suddenly gave a lurch and I fell forward. I would have fallen\\nto the deck had not a young man who was standing near-by sprung quickly\\nforward and caught me. That was the beginning of our acquaintance. My\\nmother, who had followed me on deck, thanked him warmly. Love came to\\nme swiftly. At the first glance, when our eyes met, I knew that I had\\nmet the only one in the world that I could ever love. I loved him then\\nwith all my heart.\"\\n\\n\"Such a sudden love could not be a happy one; it could not end happily.\"\\n\\nThe girl smiled.\\n\\n\"In most instances that is the case,\" replied Hildegarde. \"But in\\nmine--mine--ah, Heaven is to be thanked--mine is to be a happy love,\\nand will have a happy ending!\"\\n\\nAh, if she had but known, if she had but guessed the thoughts that\\nfilled Miss Fernly\\'s heart, she might have died then and there.\\n\\nThe sun set, and the dusk crept into the room; but it was a subject\\nthat Hildegarde loved, and she could have talked on forever about her\\nlover.\\n\\n\"Mamma is quite late in returning,\" she said, at length. \"She may not\\neven come home to dinner.\"\\n\\nThis proved to be the case. Hildegarde and her aunt dined alone. She\\ncould not help but notice how her niece watched the clock with the\\nbrightest of eyes, the color deepening on her cheeks.\\n\\n\"I shall want to talk with this lover of yours alone,\" said Miss\\nFernly, a trifle hoarsely.\\n\\n\"Will you want to talk to him long, auntie?\" asked her niece, wistfully.\\n\\n\"Yes, an hour, or perhaps two. I ordered my carriage at seven; it will\\nbe here as soon as he arrives. He will drive home with me, and can talk\\nwith me in the carriage.\"\\n\\nHildegarde was a little surprised at this announcement, but it did not\\noccur to her to offer any objection.\\n\\n\"Ah, here he comes _now_!\" cried Hildegarde, blushing furiously, all in\\na flutter of delight.\\n\\nIn a moment it seemed to her that her aunt had donned her hat and\\nmantle. She was at the door as soon as the servant, dragging Hildegarde\\nby the arm.\\n\\nEugene Mallard was surprised to see Hildegarde coming to the door to\\nmeet him. Then his eyes fell upon the tall, austere woman in the rear.\\n\\nHe felt intuitively that this must be the aunt of whom Hildegarde\\nwas always speaking. Even before he heard the hurried words of\\nintroduction, the young man held out his hand with a cordial smile.\\n\\n\"I am most pleased to meet you, Miss Fernly,\" he said. \"I have heard\\nHildegarde speak of you so much that I feel as if I really knew and\\nloved you already.\"\\n\\nWas it only his fancy, or was the greeting of Hildegarde\\'s aunt a\\ntrifle chilly?\\n\\n\"You are to accompany my aunt to her home,\" said his _fiancee_; adding,\\nwith a little twinkle in her eye: \"Auntie has something to say to you.\"\\n\\nFor a moment he looked crestfallen; then he added, gallantly:\\n\\n\"I shall be most pleased. Pray command me, Miss Fernly.\"\\n\\nAnother moment, and they were seated in the carriage. He began to talk\\nbrightly to his companion; but to his great surprise, she answered him\\nonly in monosyllables.\\n\\n\"I am very much afraid she does not like me,\" he thought, with some\\nconsternation, and he redoubled his efforts to be agreeable. Any one\\nwho was related in any way to his darling Hildegarde was dear to him.\\nHe was always liked by women; he hoped from the depths of his heart\\nthat this lady would not form an aversion to him. But somehow he felt a\\ncold, uncomfortable chill creeping over his heart. Was it a premonition\\nof the evil that was so soon to come?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVII.\\n\\n\\nAlthough Eugene Mallard tried his best to entertain Hildegarde\\'s aunt\\nas they rode along, it seemed to him an almost impossible undertaking.\\nShe stared at him too intently that he wondered what she was thinking\\nof. He thought it might be as to whether he would make Hildegarde a\\ngood husband, and he wished with all his heart to set her doubts at\\nrest on this point, so he began to talk of Hildegarde, and tell her how\\nmuch he thought of her.\\n\\nThe more he spoke of her niece, the sterner Miss Fernly\\'s face seemed\\nto grow.\\n\\nHe was wondering to himself how long she would detain him, he longed so\\nfor to return to Hildegarde, who he knew was waiting for him with the\\nutmost impatience.\\n\\nSuddenly Miss Fernly turned to him.\\n\\n\"You say you would do anything for Hildegarde\\'s good--for her future\\nhappiness?\" she asked, slowly.\\n\\n\"Yes--certainly,\" he answered. \"I would lay down my life for her. No\\nsacrifice would be too great for me to make.\"\\n\\n\"You are sure of that?\" she asked, quickly.\\n\\n\"There is no question of it,\" Hildegarde\\'s lover answered, promptly.\\n\"To save her from a moment\\'s pain, I would lay down twenty lives if I\\nhad them.\"\\n\\n\"Very well; I will soon put you to the test,\" thought Miss Fernly.\\n\\nSuddenly the carriage came to a stop. To the young man\\'s great\\nsurprise, he found, as he assisted Miss Fernly to alight, that they\\nwere in front of a small and unpretentious church.\\n\\n\"Step this way,\" she said, leading him round to the door of the\\nparsonage.\\n\\nHe had heard that Miss Fernly was very religious; but her action now\\nrather puzzled him. Still without a thought of what the outcome might\\nbe, he followed where she led.\\n\\nShe spoke hurriedly to the coachman, and with a bow, he drove quickly\\naway.\\n\\n\"The minister has been called suddenly away to a sick person,\" said the\\ngirl who admitted them to the parsonage. \"He has begged me to say that\\nhe would return within the hour.\"\\n\\nThe young man wondered what business she had with the parson; but he\\nmade no comment, but followed her into the parsonage. The reception\\nroom into which they were shown was dimly lighted. Miss Fernly seemed\\nto be well acquainted there.\\n\\nMr. Mallard took the seat Miss Fernly indicated.\\n\\n\"I have something to say to you,\" she began, in a hard, set voice. \"I\\nshall break right into the subject at once. Your wedding with my niece\\nis fixed for to-morrow night, is it not?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he said, wonderingly.\\n\\n\"Why should not your marriage take place to-night--_here_ and _now_?\"\\nshe asked, looking intently at him.\\n\\nFor an instant he almost believed that the good lady had taken leave\\nof her senses. He stared at her in the most complete bewilderment.\\n\\nIn a slow and emphatic voice she repeated her words.\\n\\n\"My dear madame,\" he said, \"I do not see how that could possibly\\nbe. You know it is not to be a _quiet_ affair. Over five hundred\\ninvitations have been issued.\"\\n\\n\"You will be married to-night, and let to-morrow night take care of\\nitself,\" said Miss Fernly, sternly.\\n\\nHad Hildegarde sent her aunt to make this arrangement? He could hardly\\nbelieve his own senses. But surely it must be so.\\n\\nHe remembered the twinkle in her eyes as she had said.\\n\\n\"You are to ride with auntie, she has something to say to you.\"\\n\\n\"I am so dumfounded, I do not know how to answer you,\" he declared.\\n\\n\"You will not refuse me?\" she asked.\\n\\n\"Refuse you! How could I refuse a request in which my happiness is so\\nmuch bound up?\" he answered, eagerly.\\n\\n\"It is well!\" said Miss Fernly. \"Your bride is on the way here by this\\ntime.\"\\n\\n\"Is this idea one of _your_ planning?\" asked Hildegarde\\'s lover,\\ncuriously.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" she answered, very quickly.\\n\\nIt seemed a very strange proceeding to him, but he then did not pretend\\nto understand the ways of women. He was only too anxious to carry out\\nHildegarde\\'s slightest wish. He was so deeply in love with her that he\\ndid not question the strangeness of her aunt\\'s action.\\n\\nBefore he had time to think over the matter, two carriages drove up to\\nthe door from different directions. Out of one stepped the minister,\\nand from the other a slender figure, robed in snowy white, and almost\\nenveloped in a white tulle veil.\\n\\nHe would have sprung to meet her, but Miss Fernly held him back.\\n\\n\"Not yet,\" she said. \"She will meet us at the altar; the minister will\\nbring her in.\"\\n\\nMiss Fernly seemed to be running this novel affair, and he did not\\nsuppose that it would be worth while to try to dissuade her, since she\\nmust have talked it over with Hildegarde.\\n\\nHe followed her into the dimly lighted church, and down the long aisle\\nto the altar-rail. Only one light was lighted, which left all the\\ncorners of the great edifice in darkness and gloom.\\n\\nHe had naturally a great deal of nerve; but to save his life he could\\nnot help a feeling of awe coming over him.\\n\\nBefore he had time to say anything, he saw the minister in his clerical\\nrobes coming from an opposite direction with the bride-elect on his\\narm. His heart throbbed, every pulse quickened; a moment more, and they\\nhad advanced.\\n\\n\"My darling!\" he cried, as he sprang forward and clasped the trembling\\ngirl in his arms.\\n\\nShe tried to speak, but the words died away in her throat. It seemed to\\nEugene Mallard that he was in a dream. Even the girl who stood by his\\nside seemed scarcely real. The folds of the filmy veil almost concealed\\nher.\\n\\n\"Are you ready?\" asked the minister, opening the book.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" answered Eugene Mallard, promptly.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Miss Fernly, speaking for the bride-elect.\\n\\nThe marriage ceremony was begun. Then came the question solemnly,\\nwarningly, from the minister\\'s lips: \"If any one knows aught why this\\nman or woman should not be united in holy wedlock, let him now speak,\\nor forever hold his peace!\"\\n\\nThere was an ominous silence. Miss Fernly trembled. She was doing a\\nnoble action in righting a terrible wrong, she told herself, and there\\nwas no response to the clergyman\\'s appeal.\\n\\nIn a voice which seemed still more solemn, he pronounced the two before\\nhim man and wife.\\n\\nThe bridegroom caught the bride in his arms, and he laughed gayly to\\nsee how she trembled in his embrace.\\n\\n\"My wife!\" he cried, straining her to his heart. \"Sweet,\" he murmured\\nin a voice just audible to his bride, \"to be the lover of the girl you\\nlove, is bliss; but to be the husband of the girl you love, is heaven!\\nTell me, Hildegarde, are you not as happy as I am?\"\\n\\nA low cry broke from the white lips of the girl he held in his arms.\\nThe minister had stepped into the parsonage in response to a summons\\nfrom one of the servants, and invited the newly wedded couple and Miss\\nFernly to follow him.\\n\\nHe was not surprised that they held back a moment. It seemed to be the\\ncustom with all new-married couples to loiter for a moment in the dim\\nshadows of the old church. The critical moment of Miss Fernly\\'s triumph\\nhad come. She had done a noble action, she told herself. But somehow\\nshe trembled at the thought of what Eugene Mallard would do when he\\ndiscovered that the girl whom he had wedded was not the beautiful\\nHildegarde but the cruelly wronged Ida May.\\n\\nThe young husband had drawn his bride beneath the chandelier of the\\nchurch, and all unmindful of Miss Fernly\\'s presence, he declared,\\nrapturously:\\n\\n\"I must have a kiss from the lips of my wife.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he drew aside her veil. One glance at the face it had\\nhidden--oh, so piteous to behold in its awful pallor! and a cry, surely\\nthe most bitter that ever broke from human lips, issued from Eugene\\nMallard\\'s. His arms fell from the supple figure, and he drew back,\\ncrying hoarsely:\\n\\n\"You are _not_ Hildegarde! Great God! what does this mean? Who are you?\"\\n\\nMiss Fernly stepped forward.\\n\\n\"I wonder that you ask such a question!\" she cried, shrilly. \"Look upon\\nher, and behold for yourself the young girl you _duped_ and deserted!\\nNow, thank Heaven, she is your wedded wife!\" she added, triumphantly.\\n\"I have helped her to right her wrongs!\"\\n\\n\"But I never saw this young woman before!\" cried Eugene Mallard,\\nstriking his forehead with his clinched hand. \"There is some terrible\\nmistake! Speak out!\" he cried to the girl at his side, who was\\ntrembling like an aspen-leaf. \"Who are you who has done this terrible\\ndeed?\"\\n\\nLike one dying, the hapless bride fell on her knees at Miss Fernly\\'s\\nfeet.\\n\\n\"There is some terrible mistake!\" she cried, wildly. \"I--I did not\\ndiscover it until he drew back my veil. He--is--not--the man!\"\\n\\n\"Not the man?\" repeated Miss Fernly, aghast, hardly believing that she\\nhad heard aright, her eyes almost starting from their sockets. \"I--I do\\nnot understand!\" she cried, recoiling from the girl. \"Do you mean that\\nthe man you have just wedded, and the one to whom you told me was the\\ncause of wrecking your life, is not one and the same?\"\\n\\nThe girl shook her head, while Eugene Mallard looked from one to the\\nother like one in a dream from which he was expecting to soon awake.\\n\\nMiss Fernly caught her by the shoulder.\\n\\n\"What does it mean?\" she cried, hoarsely. \"You assured me that this man\\nwas the cause of all your trouble, and now you dare to tell me that\\nhe is not the one! And I--brought about this, making you his wife! It\\nwas a trick of yours, you shameless creature, to secure a husband for\\nyourself. Quick! Be gone from this sacred edifice ere I strike you down\\nat my feet, you most shameless outcast, you horrible creature!\"\\n\\nIda May drew back in terror from the upraised hand.\\n\\n\"Hold!\" cried Eugene Mallard, stepping between them. \"No matter what\\nthis poor creature has done, she is, in the eyes of God and man, my\\nwife!\"\\n\\nBy a dexterous movement he had raised the poor girl from her knees, and\\nhad swung her out of the reach of the blow that had been meant for her.\\nDespite his anguish, it aroused all the pity and chivalry in his nature\\nto see how the poor thing clung to him in her terror.\\n\\n\"Save me from her wrath,\" she murmured, clinging to him with\\ndeath-cold hands, and adding vehemently: \"Believe me, it was all a\\nhorrible mistake! I saw your picture, and--and I mistook you for\\nanother. The church was so dimly lighted, I--I could not see, and I did\\nnot know the terrible mistake until--until it was too late! Oh, tell\\nme, tell me, what can I do to undo the great wrong that I have done\\nyou?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\\n\\n\\nEugene Mallard had sunk into the nearest seat, covering his face\\nwith his hands. The horror of the situation had just come to him. By\\nthe cruel working of fate he had been wedded to one woman through a\\nhorrible mistake, while his heart and soul were another\\'s.\\n\\nIt seemed to him like some horrible dream from which he must soon\\nawake. He had parted from Hildegarde full of hope and love, scarcely\\nan hour before, saying to himself, as he turned and looked back at\\nher, that ere the sun would rise and set again, she would be his own,\\nthat they would never be parted from each other after that. And now\\na barrier had suddenly risen between them which parted them just as\\nsurely as though one of them lay in the grave.\\n\\nHis whole soul was bound up in Hildegarde; yet he was wedded to\\nanother. It seemed to him that the anguish of it was more than he could\\nbear.\\n\\nThen came to him the thought that he must protect the woman he had\\nwedded--this poor young creature who still clung to him, imploring him\\nto save her from Miss Fernly\\'s wrath, repeating to him, over and over\\nagain, that it was a mistake.\\n\\nEugene Mallard roused himself from the stupor which was stealing over\\nhim. He must face the terrible consequences of that rash marriage.\\nAlthough this girl had wrecked his life, ruined his future, yet he\\ncould not find it in his heart to curse her.\\n\\nHe could not help but believe her--that it was some terrible mistake;\\nhe could not judge her before he knew more about what had prompted her\\nto do this deed. He could not rest until he knew the reason that lay\\nbehind it.\\n\\n\"Tell me all about it,\" he said, hoarsely, turning to the girl, \"that I\\nmay judge for myself of this action of yours.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, tell him,\" cried Miss Fernly, \"that I may be cleared of my part\\nin this transaction. You deceived me as well.\"\\n\\nIn a faltering voice that sounded as though she were dying, Ida May\\ntold her story, the man she had married listening intently.\\n\\nHe did not speak until she had concluded, but Miss Fernly saw that the\\ngirl\\'s story was greatly affecting him.\\n\\n\"No wonder you mistook me for Royal Ainsley, when you saw that\\npicture,\" he exclaimed, \"for we are cousins. The resemblance between us\\nwas most marked when that picture was taken.\"\\n\\n\"I--I--thought the name Miss Fernly told me was an assumed name, or\\nelse you had given me a false one.\"\\n\\nMiss Fernly\\'s self-control seemed to leave her entirely as she listened.\\n\\n\"I am responsible for it!\" she groaned, wringing her hands. \"Oh, what\\nwill Hildegarde and my sister say!\"\\n\\nEugene Mallard and Miss Fernly looked into each other\\'s faces, and\\ntheir lips were mute.\\n\\n\"Let me go to her and tell her my story,\" sobbed the hapless bride,\\n\"then I will go away, and you shall never look upon my face again!\"\\n\\n\"That would not mend matters,\" replied Eugene Mallard. \"I have married\\nyou, and nothing can undo that.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, do not say so!\" cried Ida May. \"I will free you from the bond\\nwhose links have just been forged. You shall have a divorce. I will set\\nyou free!\"\\n\\nEugene Mallard shook his head.\\n\\n\"You would do so if you could,\" he answered; \"but, alas! you can not.\\nThose whom God hath joined together no one has the right to put\\nasunder.\"\\n\\nWith a sigh that nearly rent his heart, he rose to his feet. The\\ncarriage still stood in waiting at the door.\\n\\n\"Where are you going?\" asked Miss Fernly.\\n\\n\"We will all three go to Hildegarde, and break it as gently as we can\\nto her--tell her what has happened--break the sad story to her as\\ngently as we can,\" Eugene repeated.\\n\\nAs one whose feet refused to do her bidding, Miss Fernly tottered up\\nthe aisle behind them. What would Hildegarde say--what would she do?\\nPerhaps she would fall dead at their feet, for she loved, with all the\\npassionate love of her heart, the man whom she had promised to wed on\\nthe morrow.\\n\\n\"Oh, if I had not been so hasty!\" cried Miss Fernly. \"I meant to do a\\nnoble action, but instead I have wrecked two lives!\"\\n\\nThey entered the carriage in silence--a silence which was not broken\\nuntil they reached the door of the beautiful Cramer mansion. They saw\\nHildegarde standing at the lace-draped window, peering out into the\\ndarkness, eagerly watching for them.\\n\\nThe hapless young lover groaned aloud. Miss Fernly hid her face in her\\nhands. Hildegarde was at the door to greet them almost as soon as the\\nservant.\\n\\n\"You have been gone very long, Eugene!\" she cried. \"Dear me! how\\nsurprised I was to see Aunt Fernly returning with you!\"\\n\\nThen her eyes fell upon the girl in bridal robes her lover was holding\\nby the hand. She did not recognise Ida May because of the veil which\\nshe had drawn down over her face, nor did she hear the cry of surprise\\nIda May uttered when she recognized her.\\n\\nMiss Fernly had always spoken of the bride to be as her niece, but had\\nnever once mentioned her name.\\n\\nFor one moment Ida May stood irresolute. She now realized what she had\\ndone, and wondered how Hildegarde would take the terrible mistake.\\n\\nFor a moment the three stood silent. Who would be the one to break the\\nterrible news to Hildegarde?\\n\\n\"What is the matter, and who is this beautiful young girl, clad in\\nbridal robes, whom you hold by the hand, Eugene?\"\\n\\nHe tried to speak, but he could not utter a word if his life had\\ndepended upon it. Even Miss Fernly seemed to have been stricken dumb.\\nIda May knew that it devolved upon her to utter the words which would\\nstab Hildegarde Cramer to the very soul. She saw the lover try to\\nspeak, and fail, and also saw Miss Fernly\\'s lips twitch convulsively.\\n\\nNerving herself for the ordeal through which she must pass, she stepped\\nforward.\\n\\n\"Let _me_ answer for them,\" she said, in a voice that sounded to\\nHildegarde\\'s ears like the strain of some half-forgotten melody. And as\\nshe uttered the words she threw back her veil.\\n\\n\"Ida May!\" cried Hildegarde, aghast.\\n\\n\"Yes, I am that hapless creature whom you knew as Ida May.\"\\n\\nFor an instant there was silence, broken only by the sound of the\\nlabored breathing of Miss Fernly, Hildegarde, and Eugene Mallard.\\n\\nIn an instant the haughty heiress had recovered herself. She recoiled\\nfrom the girl who advanced pleadingly before her.\\n\\n\"Hildegarde! Hildegarde!\" Ida cried, much to the astonishment of Miss\\nFernly and her companion, \"I did not know that it was you whom I was to\\nconfront in this awful hour!\"\\n\\nBut Hildegarde shrunk still further from her. How dared this creature,\\nwho had passed those weeks at Newport a living lie, to claim\\nacquaintance with her!\\n\\nShe flushed crimson, and retreated from her in abhorrence, wondering\\nhow this creature had come here, accompanied by her aunt and lover.\\n\\n\"Hildegarde!\" cried Ida May, \"listen, for the love of Heaven, and do\\nnot judge me too harshly until you have heard all!\"\\n\\nSobbing wildly, Ida caught at the hem of Hildegarde\\'s dress.\\n\\n\"Auntie!\" cried Hildegarde, turning to her relative, \"I do not care\\nto listen to anything this--this person has to say. The very air she\\nbreathes stifles me. Eugene!\" she cried, springing to her lover\\'s side,\\n\"take me in to the drawing-room. I--I can not talk to this young girl.\"\\n\\nHe did not clasp her in his arms, though he made a movement to do so.\\nHis arms fell to his sides, and his head drooped to his breast.\\n\\nHe was enduring torture so acute that many a man would have fainted\\nunder the strain of it.\\n\\nHildegarde looked up into his face in wonder.\\n\\n\"Eugene, my darling!\" she cried \"are you ill? Tell me! Something\\nterrible must be the matter! Why do you not speak?\"\\n\\nIn that instant she seemed to forget the presence of everybody, save\\nthe lover who had parted from her a few hours since, and who was now\\nstanding before her so greatly changed.\\n\\nShe looked from one to the other in consternation.\\n\\n\"Something has happened,\" she said. \"Why do you keep me in suspense?\"\\n\\n\"I am trying to tell you,\" sobbed Ida May, \"but you will not listen.\"\\n\\n\"Must I listen to her, auntie?\" cried Hildegarde, turning to her aunt.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Miss Fernly, \"you must listen, my poor child, while I pray\\nto Heaven to give you strength to bear it.\"\\n\\n\"Eugene!\" cried the girl, \"why are you silent?\"\\n\\nHe could not answer her. He only looked at her with a world of woe in\\nhis gaze, his whole frame trembling with anguish.\\n\\nIda May never knew in what words she told her strange story. Hildegarde\\nlistened like one turned to stone. Ida May told her of the awful\\nmistake that had blasted two lives and parted two who fondly loved each\\nother.\\n\\nThose who saw the look of pity in the face of Hildegarde would never\\nforget it.\\n\\nHer face became as pale as marble; the blood receded from the ripe-red\\nlips.\\n\\nShe passed through a life-time of woe in those few minutes. She did not\\nlook at Ida May or her lover when the former ceased speaking, but she\\nturned her white, set, tragic face to her aunt.\\n\\n\"_You_ have done this dreadful thing!\" she cried. \"I wonder that Heaven\\ndoes not strike you dead for it!\"\\n\\n\"Hildegarde! Hildegarde!\" cried Miss Fernly, \"I would only be too glad\\nto give my life to atone for my part in this dreadful affair.\"\\n\\nThe girl looked at her with eyes like jets of flame.\\n\\n\"If you had but told me,\" she said, in a voice that was more sorrowful\\nthan any tears could have been. \"You took the reins into your own\\nhands; you meddled with the affairs of another, and see the mischief\\nyou have wrought!\"\\n\\nA sort of frenzy seemed to possess her.\\n\\n\"Go!\" she cried, turning to Ida May, and pointing toward the door. \"Get\\nout of this house, out of my sight, before I call the servants to fling\\nyou into the street!\"\\n\\nIda May crept toward the door. To Hildegarde\\'s intense surprise, Eugene\\nMallard turned to follow her.\\n\\n\"I will go with you,\" he said, huskily, \"for you--you are my--my wife!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIX.\\n\\n\\n\"Yes; where she goes, I must follow,\" repeated Eugene Mallard, in a\\nvoice husky with emotion, \"for she is my wife!\"\\n\\nThe words fell upon Hildegarde\\'s ears with a dreadful shock. It was not\\nuntil then that she realized her lover was separated from her.\\n\\nShe saw him take Ida May\\'s hand and lead her slowly out of the house.\\n\\nIn the years that followed she wondered that the sight did not kill her.\\n\\nWhen the door closed after them, Hildegarde stood for a moment stunned,\\nwith a white, awful pallor on her face.\\n\\nMiss Fernly watched her in silence.\\n\\nWas Hildegarde going mad? If she would only cry out, utter some word.\\nBut no; only that awful silence. \"Hildegarde,\" said Miss Fernly,\\napproaching her tremblingly, \"what can I say, what can I do, to repair\\nthe terrible wrong I have done you?\"\\n\\n\"The only thing you can do is to kill me,\" answered the girl, in a\\nhoarse, unnatural voice.\\n\\n\"Oh, my niece! my precious niece, do not say that!\" replied Miss\\nFernly, beside herself with grief. \"You will break my heart!\"\\n\\n\"Yours is not the only one that will be broken,\" returned Hildegarde.\\n\\nMiss Fernly attempted to approach her, but Hildegarde drew back in\\nloathing.\\n\\n\"Do not come near me!\" she cried, with flashing eyes, \"lest I forget\\nwho you are, and strike you dead at my feet!\"\\n\\nWith a quick motion, Hildegarde turned, and without another word, flew\\nup the staircase and up to her own _boudoir_, and closed the door\\nsecurely after her.\\n\\n\"Let me realize it,\" she murmured. \"A few hours ago I was the happiest\\ngirl the world held; now I cry out to Heaven to end my life.\"\\n\\nShe crept up to the mirror, and she stood before it, tall, slender, and\\nerect in the dignity of her own despair, her face white, her dark eyes\\ndark with sorrow.\\n\\n\"Can that be me?\" she murmured, crossing her hands over her breast. But\\nthe figure reflected gave back no answer.\\n\\n\"He has gone out of my life. What am I to do?\" she murmured. \"One can\\nnever be sure of anything in this world. He left me only a few hours\\nago, and there was nothing between us but love. I can not believe it!\\nIt is some awful dream from which I shall presently awake!\"\\n\\nShe wrung her hands wildly; she tore her beautiful dark hair; she was\\nas one mad with anguish. Then she thought of Ida May, and she clinched\\nher hands.\\n\\nSome one knocked at the door\\n\\n\"Let me in, Hildegarde!\" cried her mother, anxiously.\\n\\n\"No!\" answered the girl. \"I can not--do not ask me. Only leave me here\\nalone. The sight of human faces, the sound of human voices, would drive\\nme mad!\"\\n\\nAll in vain the mother pleaded. Suddenly she heard a fall, and when one\\nof the servants whom Mrs. Cramer had summoned burst open the door, she\\nfound Hildegarde lying face downward on the velvet carpet.\\n\\nMiss Fernly had told her sister all, made a clean breast of the whole\\naffair. But Hildegarde\\'s mother did not curse her, as she feared she\\nmight do. She only looked at her sister with horror-stricken eyes.\\n\\nFor a fortnight Hildegarde lay on the bed where they had placed her.\\n\\nThe doctor had worked over her for hours.\\n\\n\"She is young,\" he said to the heart-broken mother, \"and while there is\\nlife there is hope.\"\\n\\nWhen she arose from her bed, every one was startled at the change in\\nher. She made no complaint, even to Miss Fernly, who hovered around her\\nin an agony more pitiful than words can describe.\\n\\nHildegarde was like one on whom the shadow of death had fallen. She\\ngrew thin and white; the light was gone from her beautiful eyes, the\\ncolor from her beautiful face.\\n\\nNo smile, no sound of laughter, came to the pale lips. If her mother,\\nwhose heart ached over her beloved child, tried to cheer her, she had\\nbut one answer for her, and it was:\\n\\n\"I shall die soon, my heart is slowly bleeding to death.\"\\n\\nThen came the announcement that Hildegarde was going abroad. But the\\npaper did not state how long she would remain.\\n\\nThis looked very serious indeed to the friends who had hoped against\\nall hope.\\n\\nMrs. Cramer was anxious that none of her companions should behold her,\\nshe was so terribly altered. She could not bear the criticisms which\\nshe knew her appearance would be sure to occasion. But Hildegarde had\\nstoutly declared she would not go abroad.\\n\\n\"I want to die in my native land,\" pleaded the girl, piteously.\\n\\nShe sought her couch early, because her mother was anxious about her;\\nbut her mother did not know that she paced the floor until the gray\\ndawn.\\n\\nNow her mother hastened the preparations for the trip abroad.\\n\\n\"She is young, and a change of air and scene will surely bring about\\nforgetfulness,\" thought Mrs. Cramer.\\n\\nIt was well for her that she could not foresee what was to happen in\\nthe near future.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXX.\\n\\n\\nWe must return to Ida May, dear reader, and picture to you the awful\\nwoe she experienced as she turned from Hildegarde, saying. \"Let me go\\naway out of your lives; if my life could atone for what I have done, I\\nwould give it.\"\\n\\nShe scarcely heard Eugene Mallard\\'s words, \"Where you go, I must\\nfollow, for you are my wife.\"\\n\\nShe was unaware of his presence, until fleeing down the graveled walk,\\nshe heard a step behind her, and a firm hand caught her arm. Turning,\\nshe saw the man whom she had just wedded.\\n\\nShe drew back in fear and trembling. He noticed her action, and despite\\nhis bitter woe he could not but feel sorry for her.\\n\\n\"We can not undo what has been done, my poor girl,\" he said. \"It was a\\nterrible mistake, but we must face it bravely.\"\\n\\nShe looked up into his face with wistful eyes.\\n\\n\"If you would only kill me here and now, I would be so grateful to you.\\nNo one would ever know. My life is of so little account that not one\\nin the whole world would miss me or grieve for me, and then you could\\nmarry Hildegarde!\"\\n\\nHe drew back shocked.\\n\\n\"You must not speak in that way,\" he said. \"The life of every human\\nbeing is sacred. You are entitled to your life, no matter what has\\nhappened, until God calls you. I do not blame you, my poor girl, for\\nwhat has happened. I only say we must try to face the future, and to\\nsee what can be done.\"\\n\\nBefore he could realize what she was about to do, she had flung herself\\non her knees at his feet, and covered his hands with kisses. Her heart\\nwas full of the deepest gratitude to him. He was the only being who had\\never spoken kindly to her of late.\\n\\nHe raised her gently.\\n\\n\"You should not kneel to me,\" he said, \"it is not right.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I will!\" she cried, impulsively. \"You are good--you are noble.\\nYou do not curse me for what I could not help. I want to show you how\\nbitterly I deplore what has been done! But how are you to realize it?\"\\n\\nWhile they were speaking, a few drops of rain fell from the heavens,\\nand Ida May, looking up, said to herself that even the angels above\\nwere weeping for her.\\n\\n\"Come!\" he said, taking her by the hand and leading her along as though\\nshe were a little child, \"you can not stand out in the rain. Come with\\nme!\"\\n\\nHe hailed a passing cab and placed her in it.\\n\\n\"Where are we going?\" she asked, timidly, looking up into his troubled\\nface.\\n\\n\"I do not know until I have had time to think,\" he answered. \"I have\\ntold the driver to drive about for an hour. By that time I shall have\\narrived at some conclusion.\"\\n\\nThe girl\\'s dark head drooped. Great as her own sorrow was, her heart\\nbled for the trouble which she had unintentionally caused this young\\nman.\\n\\nOn and on rolled the cab. So busy was Eugene Mallard with his own\\ntroubled thoughts that he almost forgot the girl shrinking away in her\\ncorner, who was regarding him so piteously and anxiously.\\n\\nSuddenly he turned to her.\\n\\n\"There is but one course left open to us,\" he said, huskily, \"and that\\nwe must follow. You are my wife, and I must take you to the home that\\nhas been prepared to receive my bride.\"\\n\\nShe uttered a low cry; but before she could speak, he hastened to add:\\n\\n\"No advantage shall be taken of the position in which you are so\\nstrangely placed. You shall be my wife in the eyes of the world, but\\nto me you shall be just as sacred as a sister. We will live our lives\\nthrough in this way.\"\\n\\nShe bowed her head. Whatever he suggested must be wisest and best, she\\nthought.\\n\\n\"Indeed, I can see no other way out of it at the present outlook,\" he\\nwent on, his voice trembling a little. \"I will take you to a hotel near\\nwhere I am stopping. To-morrow, at this time, I will come for you to\\ntake the train with me!\"\\n\\nA little later Ida found herself alone in the comfortable room which he\\nhad secured for her at the hotel.\\n\\nIt was then and not until then that the poor girl gave vent to her\\ngrief, suffering almost as deeply as did Hildegarde, as the long hours\\nof the night passed away.\\n\\nThe sun was shining bright and warm when she opened her eyes the next\\nmorning. For a moment she was dazed and bewildered; then a rush of\\nmemory came to her, and she remembered all that had taken place. She\\nsprung from her couch with a bitter sob on her lips. Some one tapped at\\nthe door. It was the chamber-maid.\\n\\n\"Your breakfast is to be served to you here, ma\\'am,\" she said. \"The\\nwaiter is bringing it. I will take it from him. Here are also some\\nlarge packages which arrived for you.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you!\" murmured the girl. \"Just put them on the table. But stay,\"\\nshe added in the next breath; \"you may as well open them. I do not\\nthink they are for me.\"\\n\\nWith deft fingers the girl unwrapped the bundle, and held up to her\\nastonished gaze a beautiful brown traveling suit of the finest cloth,\\nwith hat, shoes, gloves, and _lingerie_ to match. Gazing upon the\\noutfit with wide-opened eyes, she forgot her sorrow for the moment.\\n\\nThis was another proof of the thoughtfulness and kindness of the man\\nwhose life she had wrecked.\\n\\n\"What a superb traveling-dress!\" cried the maid, with delight. \"I have\\nnever seen anything like it. And the hat; why, it is a veritable dream,\\nmadame. It is so exquisitely dainty! There is something in the pocket\\nof the dress!\" exclaimed the maid. \"Does madame wish me to see what it\\nis?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Ida.\\n\\nThe next moment the girl had produced a tiny box. On a bed of violet\\nvelvet reposed a band of plain gold. Within were the engraved words:\\n\"My wife!\"\\n\\nThe poor girl caught her breath with a sob as the maid handed it to\\nher. The color came and went on her face; her eyes grew dim with tears.\\nIt was with the greatest difficulty that she succeeded in hiding her\\nemotion from the maid, whose eyes were intently fixed on her.\\n\\n\"I thought she was a single young girl,\" she thought, \"but she seems to\\nbe married.\"\\n\\nIda May turned away; she could not bear to have any one see her emotion.\\n\\n\"I can not accept it, nor any of his gifts, because I can not make use\\nof them,\" she thought. \"I am going away from here, going out of his\\nlife. I could not go with him to his Southern home; I have no right\\nthere!\"\\n\\nWhen the maid came to her, and asked her if she wished all her meals\\nserved in her room, she mechanically answered, \"Yes.\" Tempting dishes\\nwere brought, but they went back untasted.\\n\\n\"The lady in Room 27 seems very ill,\" said the chamber-maid, when she\\nwent down to the servant\\'s hall below. \"She is _very_ mysterious. Her\\neyes are so big, so black, and so mournful, you are sure she is going\\nto burst into tears at every word she utters. She looks like a creature\\nwho has passed through some great sorrow. With the exception of _one_\\nlady, I never saw any-one else look like that. And oh, mercy! she had\\nthe same room too--No. 27.\\n\\n\"This woman left word that I was to come to her in the morning. To my\\ngreat surprise, I found the door open as I turned the knob. As I went\\nforward to awaken her, I saw the still form lying on the bed. As I\\napproached, I saw, to my great amazement, that her eyes were wide open\\nand staring at me.\\n\\n\"\\'I beg your pardon for not coming sooner, ma\\'am,\\' I said. \\'I did not\\nthink you would be awake so early. There--\\'\\n\\n\"The rest of the sentence was never finished. I saw that the eyes\\nstaring up into mine were glazed in death. The scream I uttered brought\\nhalf the people in the hotel to the scene, a physician being among them.\\n\\n\"He said that the young lady had been dead some hours. She had taken\\npoison. The mystery surrounding her--who she was, and whence she came,\\nhas never been solved from that day to this. There is much the same\\nlook in this lady\\'s face as there was in that other one\\'s. I think she\\nwill bear watching.\\n\\n\"You know, too, that nine out of ten of the people who think of\\ncommitting suicide choose a hotel in which to commit the deed. This\\nyoung lady in No. 27 seems to be dazed. She scarcely knows what one is\\nspeaking to her about.\"\\n\\nHaving told her story, the chamber-maid left the room, shaking her\\nhead as she went. The clerk of the hotel, who was passing through the\\ncorridor, and who had heard the story was a little annoyed over it. He\\nknew the habit of the maids to gossip; still, there might be some truth\\nin the story.\\n\\nIt would certainly not be amiss to look into the matter a little. He\\nremembered a tall and handsome gentleman had made arrangements for the\\nlady, paying her bills in advance.\\n\\nHe thought he would wait a day and then speak to the proprietor\\nconcerning the matter.\\n\\nThe sunshine of the afternoon faded; the gloaming crept up, deepening\\ninto the soft beauty of the starry night.\\n\\nAs the hours rolled by, the girl made a resolve to end it all.\\n\\nShe arose quietly and donned the dark cloak which Miss Fernly had\\nwrapped about her as they stepped from the rector\\'s cottage. She was\\nglad to have it now, for it would cover the bridal robes which she had\\ndonned. Her bridegroom was to be death!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXI.\\n\\n\\nWith trembling hands, this hapless girl, who had taken such a terrible\\nresolve, opened the door of her room, and glided softly down the long\\ncorridor and out of the hotel.\\n\\nIda May had scarcely gained the street before a carriage drove up, and\\nEugene Mallard sprung from it. He was surprised at seeing Ida advancing\\nto meet him. She drew back with a cry.\\n\\n\"Are you ready?\" he asked; but before she could answer, he went on:\\n\"You do not wear your traveling-dress. Was there anything amiss with\\nit?\"\\n\\nShe tried to keep back the sobs from her lips; but almost before she\\nwas aware of it, she had confessed to him that she was about to flee\\nfrom him.\\n\\nStanding there, very gently and patiently, he went over the ground\\nwith her, insisting upon her following out their original plan;\\nand the upshot of it all was, she returned to her room, donned her\\ntraveling-dress, joined him again, and took a seat beside him in the\\ncarriage.\\n\\nA little later the railway station was reached, and they were soon\\nwhirling away toward the mysteries of the future.\\n\\n\"We will reach our destination a little before midnight,\" Eugene said,\\nseating himself opposite her. \"There will be a number of old friends\\nat the station to give my bride a welcome home,\" he added in a voice\\nthat was husky, despite his efforts at self-control; and Ida knew that\\nhe was thinking of that _other_ bride whom he had intended to bring to\\nthem, and she felt most wretched at the effort he was making to look\\nthe present difficulty in the face and bear up under it.\\n\\nHow he must loathe her! Her very presence must be hateful to him! The\\nthought of that made her shrink still further from Eugene Mallard.\\n\\nShe felt like opening the car window and springing from it out into the\\nblackness of the night. Then he would be free to marry Hildegarde. On\\nand on through the darkness rushed the express.\\n\\n\"The next station will be ours,\" he said at length. Ida looked up in\\napprehension. There would be a party of friends awaiting Eugene\\'s\\nhome-coming; but, ah! what would they say when they saw that it was not\\nHildegarde whom he had wedded? Had he a mother--had he sisters?\\n\\nPerhaps he divined her thoughts, for quite as soon as they had flashed\\nthrough her brain he turned to her, and said, abruptly:\\n\\n\"I have told you nothing of my home life. It was an oversight on\\nmy part, possibly because the idea did not occur to me. I have no\\nrelatives upon the face of the earth, except the scape grace cousin\\nyou know of. From my uncle I inherited the Virginia home to which\\nI am taking you. It is presided over by Mrs. Rice, an old lady who\\nhas served in the capacity of housekeeper for twenty years. All the\\nservants have been in the household quite as long a time. They are\\ngood and faithful to me. They will receive you warmly. Your word shall\\nbe their law. No one outside the household will know of our strained\\nrelationship. The secret will be kept faithfully from the world by the\\nmembers of my household.\"\\n\\n\"I do not deserve so much consideration at your hands,\" murmured the\\ngirl.\\n\\nBefore he had time to reply, their station was reached. There were few\\npeople at the station owing to the lateness of the hour.\\n\\nAn old-fashioned carry-all was waiting at the rear. Peering out from it\\nwas the face of old Black Joe.\\n\\n\"Welcome, marse! welcome!\" he cried. \"An\\' a thousand welcomes to the\\nlovely young missus, your bride! There\\'s a great company at the house,\\nsir, awaiting you both.\"\\n\\nEugene Mallard thanked the old <DW52> servant for his kind wishes for\\nhimself and bride, as he helped Ida into the vehicle.\\n\\nThere was a long ride over a rough mountain road, during which time,\\nmuch to old Black Joe\\'s surprise, scarcely a word was exchanged between\\nthe bride and groom, and it puzzled the good old man.\\n\\nWas the lady ill? So great was his concern over it, that he was tempted\\nto ask his master the question a dozen times. But prudence restrained\\nhim.\\n\\nAt length, in turning an abrupt curve in the road, a gray stone\\nmansion, fairly ablaze with lights from cellar to dome, loomed in\\nsight--lights that twinkled like glow-worms in the distance. They could\\nhear the strains of music, and as they approached they could even hear\\nthe sound of voices.\\n\\nStill no word was uttered by either of them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXII.\\n\\n\\nIn less time than it takes to tell it, the strained relationship\\nbetween Eugene Mallard and his bride was whispered through the\\nhousehold. They had laughed at old Black Joe when he had whispered the\\nstory of their silence from the railroad station, declaring he was\\nromancing. Later events certainly gave color to the story, however. She\\nwas all that was sweet and fair. What could be the trouble?\\n\\n\"If there was ever a bride most wretchedly unhappy, she is that one,\"\\nsaid Mrs. Rice, shaking her head.\\n\\n\"Why did he marry her if he did not love her? I can not understand it,\\nI am sure.\"\\n\\nMrs. Rice went to the bride\\'s room the next morning to awaken her.\\nShe found her already up and sitting by the window, and there was\\nno indication that she had removed her dress. This was reduced to a\\ncertainty when she went into the adjoining apartment and found the\\ncouch just as it had been the previous evening.\\n\\nShe went back to where young Mrs. Mallard was sitting, and laid her\\nhand gently upon the girl\\'s arm.\\n\\n\"I hope you will be happy with us here, my dear,\" she said in her\\nsweet, gentle old voice, \"for we will do everything to serve you. I\\nhave been here for many years and have witnessed the home-coming of\\nmany of the brides of the Mallards. There was never one that I took to\\nmore than I did to you, my dear child. I felt like taking you in my\\narms and pressing you to my heart. But you seem lonely. Tell me, is\\nthere anything I can do for you?\"\\n\\nIda lifted her face.\\n\\n\"You are very, very kind,\" she said, gratefully, \"and I thank you with\\nall my heart.\"\\n\\nShe looked as if she were about to add something, but quickly checked\\nherself.\\n\\n\"Perhaps you would like to see the grounds, my dear,\" said Mrs. Rice.\\n\"Will you come out into the garden?\"\\n\\nThe young woman acquiesced readily enough.\\n\\n\"Your trunks have not come yet, my dear,\" said Mrs. Rice, as they\\nwalked along. \"The railway service in this part of the country is\\nabominable. It looks strange to have you come down to breakfast in your\\ntraveling-dress, but--\"\\n\\n\"I have no trunks coming. This is the only dress I have to wear at\\npresent,\" returned the girl, quietly.\\n\\nIt was as much as the old housekeeper could do to restrain herself from\\nan exclamation of astonishment at this announcement.\\n\\nWhat could it mean? Why had Eugene Mallard\\'s bride no _trousseau_,\\nas he had been preparing for this event for months, as eager in his\\nanticipation of it as a school-boy for a holiday! She could not\\nunderstand it; she felt mystified. But with the quick wit habitual to\\nher, Mrs. Rice replied almost instantly:\\n\\n\"A wardrobe can be easily supplied by our Virginia _modistes_. Indeed,\\nthey are world-famous, I may add. They make dresses for many of the\\nladies of Washington on the shortest notice. Mr. Mallard pressed a roll\\nof bills into my hand when he arrived, and said: \\'See that my wife has\\neverything needful, Mrs. Rice.\\' I could not think what he meant at the\\ntime. Now I see it was your wardrobe he referred to. You and I will set\\nabout getting the things at once. Or if it will fatigue you too much\\nafter your journey, you leave it to me, and I will see that you have a\\ncomplete wardrobe in a short time. You must not say no, my dear; for\\nremember, it is your husband\\'s wish, and you surely wish to please him.\"\\n\\nThe girl looked at her with the strangest expression in her dark eyes.\\n\\n\"Nothing that I could do would please him,\" she said, hopelessly.\\n\\nMrs. Rice did not tell that remark to the servants, or there would have\\nbeen no end of gossip among them.\\n\\n\"There is some great mystery between Eugene Mallard and his bride,\" she\\nsaid to herself. \"I will not attempt to probe into the mystery, but I\\nwill endeavor to bring them together, if it lies within human power.\"\\n\\nThe fortnight that followed, the old mansion was fairly alive with\\nguests coming and going.\\n\\nEugene Mallard could not help but admire Ida for bearing up so bravely\\nunder the terrible ordeal. During that fortnight a strange thing\\nhappened--the cruelest blow that Heaven could have dealt Ida. The\\nlovely girl had learned to love Eugene Mallard with all the strength of\\nher nature. She was in love with him, and he was cold and indifferent.\\n\\nAnother fortnight passed, and yet another. Everything at the great\\nmansion passed pleasantly enough to the outside world. But the young\\ngirls for miles around who envied the young bride never dreamed of the\\nskeleton that existed in that magnificent mansion.\\n\\nEugene Mallard was all that was kind and considerate. It seemed a\\nnecessity to him to have the house full of company. He was never alone\\nwith Ida. How gayly he talked to his guests! Looking at him, Ida said\\nto herself:\\n\\n\"If he would but smile so when he speaks to me! His eyes are always\\ncold; no warmth or brightness ever comes into them for me.\"\\n\\nAlthough Eugene Mallard appeared so bright and gay before his guests;\\nyet, unknown to any one, his heart was filled with the bitterness of\\ndeath. It did not seem possible for him to live through the hours day\\nafter day. He felt thankful to Heaven that no one guessed that he had\\nbrought home a different bride from what he had intended. He dashed\\nrecklessly from one gayety to another, his object being to try to\\nforget Hildegarde, his love. He never voluntarily looked at the girl he\\nhad married.\\n\\nAt the end of six weeks most of the guests returned to their homes, and\\nEugene Mallard suddenly found himself alone with his young wife and the\\nservants.\\n\\n\"I must not let this happen again,\" he said. \"To live here alone\\nrequires more strength than I am possessed of.\"\\n\\nThey breakfasted alone in the great oak dining-room, and each felt the\\nrestraint which they could illy conceal.\\n\\nAs she took her place at the table she was perfectly calm and\\nself-possessed, but the mask of smiles she had worn before his guests\\nfell from her face. She did not attempt any conversation with him, but\\nwith a quick, flashing smile she answered when she was spoken to.\\n\\n\"It seems to take the servants exceptionally long to serve breakfast,\"\\nhe said, impatiently; adding: \"Will you permit me to glance over the\\nmorning paper? I am interested in this column on stocks.\"\\n\\nShe bowed her head gracefully, and watched him, as he read in silence.\\nThere came over her face an air of sadness painful to see in one so\\nyoung.\\n\\nTo Ida the departure of the company was a great relief. Indeed, she\\nlonged for solitude, and thought that if they did not go soon she could\\nnot keep up much longer.\\n\\nShe had wanted to go away long ago; but she had remained there, and now\\nthe attraction was so great that she would not break away even if she\\ncould. Her love for her husband was like a magnet, strong as her very\\nlife-blood, a part of every heart-beat.\\n\\nFor long hours she would muse over her strange position.\\n\\nIt was an uncommon fate--young, with life all before her, she longed\\nfor its blessings. It was pitiful for her to know that the man she had\\nlearned to love cared for another, that she was no more to her husband\\nthan she would be to a brother.\\n\\nHow sad it was that she should long for the love of her husband as\\nshe had never longed for anything else in life! It seemed so strange\\nto live in that magnificent home, to have everything that her heart\\ndesired, to be wealthy, honored, and envied, yet to have no husband\\'s\\nlove.\\n\\nDid he still sigh for Hildegarde? Was he thinking of her when that\\ndreamy look came into his eyes? She would give the world to know. She\\nfelt a terrible jealousy in her heart.\\n\\n\"Will he never change?\" she asked herself, in despair. \"Living under\\nthe same roof with me, seeing me day after day, will his heart never\\nwarm ever so little toward me?\"\\n\\nOnce more the old resolve, to steal away from the house, came to her.\\nShould she go to him, kneel at his feet, and sob out:\\n\\n\"I can not remain in this house any longer, because I--I--have learned\\nto love you.\"\\n\\nShe could picture the surprise on his face. Perhaps there would be\\nanger, scorn. The eagle dared to look at the sun, the worm dared to\\ncreep into the tender heart of the rose. Was it strange that she had\\ndared to love him?\\n\\nHers was a dreary fate, and she tried to bear it bravely. If she had\\nonly some one to confide in, some one to talk to! Was his heart dead\\nbecause of his bitter disappointment?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\\n\\n\\nOne morning Eugene Mallard informed his young wife at the\\nbreakfast-table that he had invited a party of friends from the\\nadjoining city, and had just received word that they would be with them\\nthat day. This was sorrowful news to Ida, for she realized that she\\nwould see less of her husband when they came. But he seemed to await\\ntheir arrival in a fever of impatience.\\n\\nWhile she was wondering how many there would be in the party, her\\nhusband said, as if in answer to the unexpressed thought:\\n\\n\"There will be six in the party--Mrs. Staples and her two daughters,\\nDora and Louisa, Captain Drury, Arthur Hollis, and--and Vivian Deane.\"\\n\\nIda looked up quickly as her husband pronounced the last name. Was it\\nonly her fancy, or did he turn away abruptly?\\n\\nSomehow she could not rid herself of the fancy.\\n\\nThen suddenly it occurred to her that she had heard the name, Vivian\\nDeane, before. She remembered the conversation well.\\n\\nWhile their former guests were there, she had been sitting in the\\nrose-embowered veranda one day, while two of them passed on the lawn,\\nand the fragments of their conversation floated up to her.\\n\\n\"I am surprised to find that Vivian Deane is not here,\" said one.\\n\\n\"Indeed! I would have been more surprised if she had been here,\" said\\nthe other.\\n\\nThey were idle words, almost meaningless, as far as she was concerned,\\nbut the name, Vivian Deane, clung to her for many days afterward. This\\nwas the last morning she would have with her husband. It was generally\\nhis custom to smoke in the grounds after breakfast. If she walked over\\nthe lawn she might be able to have a little chat with him.\\n\\nShe made a tour of the grounds, but to her surprise she did not see\\nEugene Mallard. Perhaps he was detained in the library writing letters.\\nA little brook ran through a far corner of the grounds, and on either\\nside of it tall laurel bushes grew.\\n\\nWould life ever be any different for her? Would fate be always as\\nunkind as now? Bitter tears, which she could not restrain, sprung to\\nher eyes and coursed down her cheeks.\\n\\nShe tried to stop their flow, but she could not, though she realized\\nthat they would be a sorry object before her husband\\'s guests. At that\\nmoment she heard the sound of footsteps.\\n\\nLooking through the bushes she saw two of the servants walking\\nleisurely along, one carrying a basket of newly gathered fruit, and\\nthe other a basket of freshly cut roses.\\n\\nWas it fate that caused one of them to say:\\n\\n\"Let us not return to the house just yet. The morning is warm and fine,\\nwhy not sit down here under the shade of this tree and tie the roses\\ninto bunches? I can do it as well here as in the house.\"\\n\\nWhereupon they leisurely proceeded to seat themselves.\\n\\n\"It isn\\'t the same house since master brought home his bride,\" said the\\nother. \"It\\'s nothing but company, company, all the time. Now we are to\\nhave another new lot of guests.\"\\n\\n\"And guess who is invited _this_ time,\" said her companion.\\n\\n\"Mr. Mallard seems to know everybody in the country, so it would be a\\npretty hard guess,\" laughed the girl.\\n\\n\"Well,\" returned the other, \"as you are not so good at guessing, I may\\nas well tell you--it is Miss Vivian Deane.\"\\n\\n\"Pray, who is _she_?\" asked the girl who was tying the roses.\\n\\n\"Oh, I forgot you were not here long enough to know about her. Well,\\nI will tell you. She is a young girl who lives a few miles away in\\na magnificent house called Deane Castle. She is as beautiful as a\\ndream, and as heartless as she is beautiful. She has a doll-like\\npink-and-white face, big blue eyes, and a wealth of flaxen curls.\\nThough she looks like an angel, a bigger devil in woman\\'s form never\\nlived.\\n\\n\"She was a great favorite with old Eugene Mallard, the uncle, and his\\nfond wish was that his favorite nephew should fall in love with and\\nmarry the pretty girl. But, bless you, the young man had ideas of his\\nown.\"\\n\\n\"Who else is coming?\" was the next question.\\n\\n\"A lady and her two daughters. They used to be dead in love with Mr.\\nMallard, until they found it was useless. They were more sensible,\\nhowever, than Vivian Deane. They turned their attention elsewhere, and\\nthey are still looking for eligible husbands.\"\\n\\nIda May\\'s heart throbbed wildly. Now she knew why her husband\\'s face\\nhad flushed as he mentioned the name of Vivian Deane. And this was the\\nyoung girl whom she was so soon to meet!\\n\\nIda felt nervous at the very thought of the ordeal before her. She knew\\nshe must be in the drawing-room to welcome his guests. Her husband\\nwould expect that of her.\\n\\nDrying her tears, though her heart was heavy indeed, the young wife\\nstole back quietly to the house, and up to her own room. When she had\\nremoved the traces of tears, she looked with pitiful wistfulness at the\\nface which the mirror reflected.\\n\\nHow long would it take this Vivian Deane, who loved her husband so\\nmadly, to discover that he was most unhappy in his marriage?\\n\\nThere was a light tap on the door, and in answer to her \"Come in\" one\\nof the maids entered the room.\\n\\n\"If you please, Mrs. Mallard, your husband would like to have you come\\ndown into the drawing-room. He says the guests are likely to arrive at\\nany moment.\"\\n\\n\"Say that I will be down directly,\" she replied, and her voice sounded\\nso hoarse and unnatural that she feared the girl would notice her\\nemotion.\\n\\n\"Would you like me to help you arrange your toilet, ma\\'am?\" she asked,\\nstill holding the door knob in her hand.\\n\\nHer toilet! she had not thought of it, so deeply had she been engrossed\\nin her thoughts. Yes, she must make every effort to look well, because\\nthe eyes of her rival would be upon her.\\n\\n\"Yes, you may help me if you will,\" she said, wistfully. And when she\\nwas dressed and standing before her mirror, she was so nervous she\\ncould hardly stand. The maid noticed her trembling.\\n\\n\"You are ill, my lady,\" she cried, in alarm; \"your face has grown very\\npale. Do let me bring you a glass of wine!\"\\n\\n\"No,\" replied her young mistress; \"it is only a momentary pain. I will\\nbe better presently.\"\\n\\nAs the maid watched, Ida\\'s face grew from deathly pale to a flushed\\nappearance, and her hands were burning hot.\\n\\n\"I think I must go and see the housekeeper. I am sure Mrs. Mallard is\\nnot fit to receive guests. She is very ill,\" she said to herself.\\n\\n\"If you only felt as well as you looked, my lady,\" said the girl, aloud\\nand admiringly.\\n\\n\"Do you think I look well, Marie?\" she asked, with a pitiful eagerness\\nin her voice.\\n\\n\"Oh, ma\\'am, if I dared speak the truth without being accused of\\nflattery, I would say I never saw any-one so beautiful in all my life!\"\\n\\n\"Do I look more beautiful than Vivian Deane?\" was the question that\\nrose to her lips. But she checked the words just in time. At that\\nmoment another maid tapped at the door, and inquired if her mistress\\nwould soon be down.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" returned Ida. \"I am coming directly.\"\\n\\nAs she uttered the words, she heard the sound of carriage wheels. By a\\ngreat effort, she nerved herself for the ordeal.\\n\\n\"Why, how foolish I am!\" she said, with a nervous little laugh. But\\nsomehow a premonition of coming evil crept over her which she could not\\nshake off.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\\n\\n\\nEugene Mallard did not look up as his young wife entered the room. He\\nwas gazing so steadily out of the window that he did not even hear her\\nlight footsteps. She went up to him timidly. Whatever she was about to\\nsay died away on her lips, for the expression on his face startled\\nher. She had never seen him look so cross before.\\n\\nAt that moment the servant announced: \"Mrs. and the Misses Staples!\"\\n\\nEugene Mallard stepped forward quickly to receive them. How his face\\nlighted up! Was it only her fancy, or did he hold the hand of the\\nprettiest girl a moment longer than was necessary? Then he turned and\\nintroduced them to his young wife. Louisa and Dora Staples looked at\\nher eagerly; she could see great surprise in their faces.\\n\\nWere they disappointed in her? That was the first thought that crossed\\nIda\\'s mind. How was she to know their thoughts? Dora Staples came\\nforward, holding out her hands and blushing like a school-girl. Louisa\\nstood back, gazing in puzzled wonder at the bride.\\n\\n\"We were very sorry that we could not be here to witness your\\nhome-coming and to participate in the grand wedding reception that\\nevery one is talking about even yet. But we were miles and miles away.\"\\n\\nThen the conversation drifted into other channels.\\n\\nA few moments later two gentlemen arrived--Captain Drury and Arthur\\nHollis. Ida remembered them well; they had been to the reception. The\\ntwo girls were delighted at this acquisition to the party, and in a\\nfew moments Dora Staples had captured the dashing captain for a chat,\\nleaving Arthur Hollis for her sister Louisa.\\n\\nBut Mr. Hollis was not in a mood to enjoy the senseless chatter of Miss\\nLouisa Staples, for whom he inwardly felt a cordial dislike.\\n\\nOn the pretense of wishing to smoke a cigar, especially as her mother\\nand Mrs. Mallard had joined the group, he begged her to excuse him for\\na little while. He saw his host on the terrace, and stepped out of the\\nlong French window, and went at once to where he stood.\\n\\n\"I congratulate you upon the rare beauty of your wife,\" he said,\\ntouching him familiarly upon the arm. \"I thought her exceedingly\\npretty the first time I saw her; she has grown more beautiful since.\"\\n\\n\"I really ought to be obliged to you for the compliment,\" returned\\nEugene Mallard, laughingly.\\n\\n\"You ought to love her very much, for she is worth loving,\" said Arthur\\nHollis, bluntly, as he knocked the ashes from his cigar.\\n\\n\"Has any one told you that I do not?\" asked Mallard, quickly.\\n\\n\"No, certainly not; but she does not look happy,\" returned Hollis,\\nthoughtfully. \"As a friend of many years\\' standing, I feel myself\\nprivileged to speak without reserve to you, my old comrade. Forgive\\nme for saying that though your bride\\'s eyes ought to be filled with\\nsunshine, they are noticeably sad and dreary. Hers is not a happy face,\\nEugene.\"\\n\\nMr. Mallard frowned. He had heard quite enough of this topic. His\\nwife\\'s face did not interest him. Arthur Hollis had been his friend for\\nlong years; they had been chums from childhood. Suddenly Eugene turned\\nand laid his hand on Arthur Hollis\\'s shoulder.\\n\\n\"I have a strange explanation to make to you,\" he said in a voice husky\\nwith emotion. \"Your keen eyes have discovered, Hollis, what I would\\nfain have kept from you. A full confession is good for the soul, they\\nsay, and I will tell you this much, Arthur: the girl whom I told you\\nso much about, is not the one whom I have married. At the altar, in a\\ndimly lighted church, this girl took the place of the one whom I was\\nto wed, and I did not find it out until we had been pronounced man and\\nwife.\"\\n\\nHollis could not have been more completely astounded if a volcano had\\nopened at his feet.\\n\\nEugene Mallard had to repeat his words before Hollis could grasp the\\nwhole meaning of what he had heard.\\n\\n\"You must not think that I wronged her in any way, that she had any\\nclaim upon me,\" went on Eugene Mallard, huskily. \"Do not judge me too\\nhastily. It all came about through a mistake. She--she--mistook me for\\nRoyal Ainsley, my cousin, and hearing that I was to be married, came\\nthere, and--and, by the aid of a woman, succeeded in becoming my bride.\\nAnd now, because of it, three lives are ruined. I am trying to make\\nthe best of it, but it seems, at times, as though I will not be able\\nto bear up under it--my whole heart belonging to one woman, while I am\\nwedded to another.\"\\n\\n\"Great heavens!\" exclaimed Hollis. \"I did not dream of such a state of\\naffairs!\"\\n\\n\"She is my wife in name only,\" added Eugene Mallard, bitterly. \"I do\\nnot know what the future will bring forth. I can only say that I am\\ntrying to live it out as best I can. My life is full of wretchedness,\\nand I can not see what will be the end of it all.\"\\n\\nNow Arthur Hollis could readily understand the brooding look in Ida\\'s\\neyes. Why she was graver, more thoughtful, more abstracted than when he\\nhad seen her last.\\n\\nWhile they were talking, another carriage drove up.\\n\\nThey saw a beautiful face at the window.\\n\\n\"It is Vivian Deane,\" said Mr. Mallard.\\n\\nHollis looked surprised.\\n\\n\"I hope, my dear boy,\" he said in a tone of jest, beneath which was\\ncertainly a vein of earnestness, \"that Miss Deane has got over her mad\\ninfatuation for you, now that she knows you are married!\"\\n\\nMr. Mallard looked thoughtful.\\n\\n\"I suppose you are wondering why I invited her here,\" he said, slowly,\\n\"and I may as well tell you the truth, that you will not for a moment\\nimagine I sent for her to indulge in a flirtation. Miss Deane wrote me\\nthat she was coming to pay my wife a fortnight\\'s visit, so what could I\\ndo. Without waiting to receive a reply from me, here she is. You will\\ncome with me, and welcome her?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" said Hollis, understanding Eugene\\'s position.\\n\\nMiss Deane looked exceedingly annoyed as the two men approached.\\n\\nShe had calculated upon meeting Eugene alone. She meant to tell him\\nin a few words that her life was ruined because of his marriage. Now\\nshe could only exchange the merest formal greeting. Biting her red lips\\nfiercely, and forcing a smile to them, she held out her hand.\\n\\n\"I am so delighted at seeing you again, Mr. Mallard,\" she declared,\\ngiving Hollis a stiff, haughty bow.\\n\\nEugene assisted her from the carriage and avoided looking at her as\\nmuch as possible--a fact which annoyed her exceedingly.\\n\\n\"And I am so anxious to see your bride,\" she continued.\\n\\nEugene could readily understand that, and so could Hollis.\\n\\nHollis followed his friend to the drawing-room. He stood by the young\\nbride\\'s side when Vivian Deane was presented to her.\\n\\nHe had expected to see an expression of bitter dislike on the doll-like\\npink-and-white face. He was surprised and relieved to see Vivian hold\\nout her little hands and murmur in her cooing voice:\\n\\n\"I am so delighted to see you, Mrs. Mallard, I am sure we shall be\\nfriends.\"\\n\\nIda gazed anxiously, wistfully, into the pink-and-white face. Vivian\\'s\\nsea-blue eyes met her gaze unflinchingly; her red lips, which suggested\\nmore of art than nature, wore a mask of the sweetest smiles.\\n\\nThe young bride drew a deep breath of relief. She had been\\nunnecessarily frightened, she told herself. Now that Vivian knew\\nEugene was married, she had in all probability resigned herself to the\\ninevitable.\\n\\n\"Probably she has another lover by this time, and thinks no more of\\nEugene,\" thought Ida.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXV.\\n\\n\\nAlone in her room, Vivian Deane stood before her mirror and critically\\nviewed the face reflected in it.\\n\\n\"I am more beautiful than Eugene Mallard\\'s wife,\" she cried, nodding\\napprovingly to the dimpled, smiling face, \"and I will make that beauty\\ntell. He does not look happy,\" she mused. \"I, who know him so well, can\\nsee it. He has married her, but he is dissatisfied. There is something\\namiss between them. Ere I have been in this house a week, I will\\ndiscover what it is.\" She nodded to the reflection in the mirror. \"I\\nhad hoped that, seeing him married, I could steel my heart against him,\\nbut I find I can not.\"\\n\\n\"There is something connected with the manner in which Eugene Mallard\\nfirst met his wife that I must find out,\" was Vivian\\'s mental comment.\\n\\nIt was not long before Vivian discovered that her beautiful young\\nhostess knew almost nothing of music.\\n\\n\"I think I have discovered her secret,\" she said to herself. \"She must\\nhave been a poor girl, perhaps a working-girl.\"\\n\\nInstead of seeing the wisdom of God in such an alliance, whereby the\\nwealthy might share with the poor the gifts God had showered upon them,\\nshe was angrier than ever.\\n\\nFrom the hour in which she had asked Ida the question concerning her\\nmeeting with Eugene Mallard, the young wife avoided being alone with\\nher guest.\\n\\nVivian could not help but notice it, and she smiled to herself. She\\nseemed to have no wish to capture handsome Captain Drury or Arthur\\nHollis. She preferred to talk to her hostess on each and every occasion.\\n\\n\"Yon have not told me,\" she said one day, \"whether you lived in New\\nYork, San Francisco or Boston.\"\\n\\n\"Most of my life was spent in a little village outside of the great\\nmetropolis,\" said Ida, inwardly hoping the inquisitive girl would not\\nthink of asking the name of the village.\\n\\nVivian did think of it, but concluded that it would be wisest not to\\npursue her inquiries too ardently.\\n\\n\"All this ought to have been mine,\" muttered Vivian, clinching her\\nhands tightly--\"all mine! I loved him first, and I loved him best. She\\nhad no right to take him from me!\"\\n\\nThese thoughts often ran through Vivian\\'s mind while Ida was talking to\\nher, believing she was entertaining the best and truest friend she had\\nin the great cruel world.\\n\\nIf the young wife had known her as she really was, she would have\\nturned in utter loathing from the beautiful pink-and-white face; she\\nwould have prayed Heaven to save her from this, her greatest foe.\\n\\nAs it was, she saw only Vivian Deane\\'s beauty and grace. She heard only\\nkindness in her voice, and she thought to herself that she was very\\nfortunate indeed in securing such a friend.\\n\\nShe talked and laughed so happily that the poor young wife almost\\nforgot her sorrow while listening to her.\\n\\nVivian wondered if by any chance the young bride had found out how\\ndesperately she had been in love with her husband in other days.\\n\\nThe young wife became more and more unhappy day by day. Once, in\\nfollowing the windings of a brook, Ida was startled at finding herself\\nseveral miles from home. Glancing up with a start, she found that the\\nsun had almost reached its height. She had been gone longer than she\\nhad intended.\\n\\nPerhaps there was some way by which she could take a shorter cut to\\nthe house. She saw a woman slowly advancing along the path, carrying a\\nlittle baby in her arms. She stopped short as the woman approached. She\\nrecognized her as the wife of one of the village merchants.\\n\\nIda had often seen her driving on the road with her husband, holding\\nthe little child in her lap, and she had said to herself, as she\\nturned away to hide the tears that would spring to her eyes: \"That\\nwoman has everything in the world to make her life happy. I would\\nexchange places with her gladly if I could.\"\\n\\nThe woman smiled as she saw Eugene Mallard\\'s young wife, and appeared\\nannoyed upon observing that she was about to stop and speak to her. She\\nanswered her question readily enough, and pointed out the way, a short\\ncut over the meadows, that would bring her near her home. Still Ida\\nlingered, looking wistfully at the young mother.\\n\\n\"I have often seen you, from my window, rambling by the brook-side. You\\nmust be very fond of out-door life,\" said Ida.\\n\\n\"I do love the sunshine,\" replied the young woman; \"but I do not come\\nout for it only for myself, but for baby\\'s sake also.\"\\n\\nA great, sudden thrill that made her soul grow faint and dizzy filled\\nIda\\'s whole being as her gaze rested on the babe she carried. She\\nthought of that other one, in a nameless grave, sleeping under the\\ndaisies. It would have been just about the age of this little one had\\nit lived.\\n\\n\"How happy you must be!\" sighed Ida.\\n\\n\"We are not always what we seem,\" replied the woman, with a sigh. \"I\\nlove this little thing very dearly, but it is not my own child. I had a\\nlittle one whom I loved better than my life,\" went on the woman, sadly.\\n\"When it died, I refused to be comforted. I took on so that my husband\\ngrew frightened.\\n\\n\"\\'Don\\'t fret, Margaret,\\' he said; \\'I will find a way to comfort you.\\'\\n\\n\"He sent to some foundling asylum in the great city, and this little\\none was brought to me to fill the aching void in my heart. I love it\\nvery dearly, but oh! it can never take the place of the one I lost.\"\\n\\nEugene Mallard\\'s wife was looking at it with her soul in her eyes.\\n\\n\"Poor little waif!\" she sighed; \"it was very fortunate in securing a\\nhome with you.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, Mrs. Mallard,\" said the woman. \"We are poor and plain\\npeople, but we will do what we can for the poor little thing.\"\\n\\nShe was about to pass on, thinking she had taken up too much of the\\nlady\\'s time with her story.\\n\\nSuddenly Ida turned, her beautiful dark eyes heavy with tears.\\n\\n\"Would you mind letting me hold the baby for just one minute?\" she\\nasked, wistfully.\\n\\n\"No, certainly not,\" replied the woman, with a pleasant smile.\\n\\nAgain that thrill which she could hardly define shot through her as she\\nreceived the babe from the woman\\'s arms. She bent her face over the\\nlittle rose-leaf one that lay upon her breast. Her lips moved, but no\\nsound came from them.\\n\\nIt seemed to rend her very heart-strings to relinquish her hold of the\\ninfant--to hand it back to the woman who waited to receive it. The\\nmoments seemed to fly by on golden wings.\\n\\nIt seemed to Ida that she could stand there for long hours looking\\ndown into that lovely little face and those two great starry eyes\\nthat looked up wonderingly into her own. It cost her a great pang to\\nhand the child back to the woman. But time was fleeting. She could\\nnot remain there longer, for the distant bells of the village were\\nalready ringing, proclaiming the noonday hour, and she must go home, or\\nluncheon would be kept waiting.\\n\\n\"You come here often?\" she asked, turning again to the woman.\\n\\n\"Almost every day,\" was the reply.\\n\\nThe hapless young wife made up her mind that she would see them often.\\nActing upon a sudden impulse, she took out her purse and handed the\\nwoman a golden coin.\\n\\n\"Take that for the little one,\" she said. \"What is its name?\"\\n\\n\"We haven\\'t decided upon its name yet,\" returned the woman; \"we have\\nonly had the child a few weeks.\"\\n\\n\"Would you think over it if I suggested a name?\" asked Ida, wistfully.\\n\\n\"Yes, indeed,\" replied the woman. \"You may be sure I would.\"\\n\\n\"Why not call her \\'Ida May\\'?\" murmured the young wife, with her whole\\nheart and soul in her eyes.\\n\\n\"That is a beautiful name,\" cried the woman--\"Ida May Lester. That is\\nwhat it shall be!\"\\n\\nSomehow the naming of the poor waif gave to the hapless young wife a\\ngreat relief.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\\n\\n\\nIda wended her way over the flower-strewn meadow, with her heart\\nbeating more wildly than it had ever beaten before. She could not\\nforget the flower-like little infant that had looked up into her face,\\nand which had so strangely affected her.\\n\\nEven the guests noted her heightened color; and Vivian Deane, watching\\nher narrowly from across the table, wondered what brought the\\nbrightness to her eyes.\\n\\nShe looked at Eugene Mallard with intense interest. Surely there was\\nno corresponding gladness in his eyes. Indeed, he looked unusually\\ncareworn.\\n\\n\"I will soon find out what has happened,\" said Vivian, with a pang of\\nbitter jealousy.\\n\\nA little later Vivian sought Ida in her _boudoir_.\\n\\n\"It has commenced to rain,\" she said, \"and I am at a loss to know\\nwhat to do with myself. The Staples girls have gone to their rooms to\\nrest, and their mother wearies me talking about Christian charity. The\\ngentlemen have repaired to the smoking-room, and so I have sought you.\"\\n\\n\"You are very welcome,\" said Ida. \"I will do my best to amuse you.\"\\n\\nAs she looked at Vivian, she said to herself:\\n\\n\"How foolish I have been to imagine that this brilliant, beautiful girl\\nshould care for a man who belonged to another girl.\"\\n\\nVivian had a very fascinating way when among women, and now she exerted\\nherself to please Eugene Mallard\\'s young wife as she had never exerted\\nherself to please any one before.\\n\\n\"What a very cozy _boudoir_ you have, Ida!\" she said. \"It is like a\\ncasket for some precious jewel. How considerate your husband was to\\nhave it furnished to suit your rich dark beauty. I used to think that\\nnothing was pretty except white and gold or blue and white.\"\\n\\n\"That is only natural,\" returned Ida. \"You are a pronounced blonde, you\\nknow.\"\\n\\n\"Then you do not agree with me that there is a possibility of blondes\\nliking rich dark surroundings?\"\\n\\n\"No; I should not fancy so,\" returned Ida, \"except that blondes usually\\nfall in love with dark men.\"\\n\\nVivian flushed a vivid scarlet, which Ida did not see, for at that\\nmoment Vivian\\'s face was turned from her.\\n\\n\"Yes, that is very true,\" returned Vivian, making an effort to control\\nher emotion.\\n\\nIn her case, Vivian knew that the old saying was at fault. The strong,\\npassionate love of her heart had gone out to Eugene Mallard, and he was\\nfair. He was her ideal of manly beauty. The faces of other men appeared\\nquite insignificant when compared to his. She was anxious to turn the\\nconversation into another channel.\\n\\n\"I have often thought, amid all this gayety, how lonely you must be at\\ntimes without some girl friend to talk matters over with you,\" said\\nVivian.\\n\\n\"You are quite right,\" said Ida, eagerly. \"I _do_ need a girl friend,\\nsome one of my own age, to whom I could open my heart.\"\\n\\nVivian glided up to her and threw her arms about her neck.\\n\\n\"Let me be that friend,\" she whispered, eagerly.\\n\\nThe young wife looked at her wistfully; her cheeks flushed.\\n\\n\"I shall be only too glad, Vivian,\" Ida said.\\n\\n\"If she had heard that I was in love with her husband, I must first\\nthrow her off the track,\" thought Vivian.\\n\\n\"I am going to tell you a secret,\" she murmured, aloud; \"but you must\\nnot reveal it to any one, I have had a strange love affair, Ida.\"\\n\\nShe felt the young wife start, her figure tremble; she saw the lovely\\nface grow pale. But not appearing to notice her agitation, she went on:\\n\\n\"My hero is as dark as a Spanish knight. I met him recently. It was a\\ncase of love at first sight. He proposed to me within a fortnight. But\\nmy relatives do not like him, wealthy, handsome, courteous though he\\nis. They have forbidden him the house, yet I think in time they will\\novercome their objections.\"\\n\\nShe could plainly see how her fictitious story relieved the young\\nwife. The color came back to Ida\\'s cheeks, the light to her eyes. She\\nthrew her arms impulsively about Vivian, and kissed her fair, lovely,\\ntreacherous face.\\n\\n\"You are indeed to be envied, Vivian,\" she said, earnestly. \"To love\\nand be loved is the greatest happiness God can give any one. I hope,\\nfor _your_ sake, that your lover may win his way to the hearts of your\\nrelatives. But you know that the course of true love never did run\\nsmoothly.\"\\n\\n\"My lover is a great friend of your husband\\'s, and perhaps he has told\\nyou about it?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Ida. \"I assure you that Mr. Mallard has not spoken to me on\\nthe subject,\" and she looked very discomforted.\\n\\n\"I am sure your husband must have received a letter from my lover and\\nhidden it away somewhere. Won\\'t you be so kind as to look thoroughly\\nthrough his desk, and see?\" asked Vivian.\\n\\nIda drew back in alarm.\\n\\n\"Oh, I could do not do what you ask. Mr. Mallard\\'s rooms are in another\\npart of the house,\" Ida answered, thoughtlessly.\\n\\nIda now realized the importance of the admission she had thoughtlessly\\nmade. But she could not recall her words--it was too late.\\n\\nVivian looked astounded. This was a state of affairs of which she had\\nnever dreamed. Her idea had been to find some pretext to look through\\nEugene Mallard\\'s desk, and to abstract all the notes she had written to\\nhim.\\n\\nShe remembered one or two which she had written in which she had poured\\nout her love for him in a mad fashion, and she would not like any one\\nto come across them.\\n\\nBut here she had unearthed a startling surprise. Eugene Mallard\\'s rooms\\nwere in another part of the house. Then they were indeed estranged. She\\nmust find out the secret that lay between them.\\n\\n\"I am so sorry to have unearthed so sad a secret,\" cried the false\\nfriend, winding her arms more tightly about Ida, and turning her face\\naway, that the young wife might not observe the look of triumph in it.\\n\"But every life has its sorrow, and perhaps it was meant that I should\\ncomfort you. If you are wearing out your heart longing for the sympathy\\nof a true friend, oh, dear Ida, please do confide in me, and let me\\nhelp you!\"\\n\\nThe words had such a ring of sympathy in them that it was no wonder the\\nyoung wife believed her. She was young and unversed in the ways of the\\nworld, or this beautiful false friend could not have deceived her so.\\n\\n\"Oh, Vivian, I _am_ unhappy,\" she sobbed, \"surely the most unhappy girl\\nthe sun ever shone on! I must make a confidant of some one--tell some\\none my troubles, or I shall die. My--my husband does not love me!\"\\n\\n\"Does not love you!\" repeated Vivian. \"Then why on earth did he marry\\nyou?\"\\n\\nThe hapless young wife could find no answer to that question; her head\\ndrooped, and her lips were dumb.\\n\\n\"I am so glad you told me this,\" said Vivian; and it was strange that\\nIda did not notice the ring of triumph in the voice of her false friend\\nas she said: \"I will do my best to bring you two together. I do not ask\\nwhich one is at fault. Both can not be entirely blameless.\"\\n\\n\"There is a shadow between us which never can be lifted,\" sobbed the\\nyoung wife, putting her head on Vivian\\'s shoulder. \"There is love on\\nonly one side,\" went on Ida, despairingly. \"He is indifferent to me,\\nand--and he will grow to hate me.\"\\n\\n\"Forgive me, please, if I have been so engrossed in my own love affair\\nthat I did not notice anything was amiss between my old friend Eugene\\nand his fair young bride.\"\\n\\n\"I almost dread to think of the future,\" moaned the young wife. \"There\\nare times when I give myself up to wondering over the strange problems\\nof life, and I ask myself why I, who should be happy, find the world so\\ndark and dreary.\"\\n\\n\"You must be very patient,\" said Vivian, \"and above all things,\\nlet me warn you against being the first to make overtures for a\\nreconciliation.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I am so very, very glad that I have had this talk with you,\"\\nsobbed Ida, \"for during the past week I had come to the conclusion that\\nthe very first time I found my husband in the library, I would go up\\nto him, and say; \\'This kind of life is killing me. It would be better\\nfar for you to plunge a knife in my breast and kill me. Either take\\nme to your heart, either make me your wife in fact as well as name,\\nor send me out into the coldness and bitterness of the world. I can\\nendure this no longer. Your friends crowd about me, thinking I am the\\nhappiest person in the world, while I am the most miserable. I must go\\nfrom here, because I have learned to love you, my husband, with all\\nmy heart and soul. You may be surprised to hear this from me, but it\\nis the truth. I love you as no one else ever will. You may live for\\nyears, flattered and happy, but no love like mine will ever come to you\\nagain. Although you married me, yet you do not love me, and never will.\\nAlways remember that the wife who is leaving you loves you with all her\\nheart. I would not tell you this now, but that I know in this world we\\nmay never meet again.\\'\"\\n\\nHer voice died away in a whisper as she uttered the last word, and the\\nfalse friend who had determined to part husband and wife said she had\\nlearned just in time what was necessary to prevent a reconciliation\\nbetween Ida and her husband.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\\n\\n\\nAfter Vivian Deane had learned of the estrangement of Eugene and Ida,\\nshe made up her mind that she would part them forever.\\n\\nBut how? She thought over the matter long and earnestly. She was\\nstanding in the magnificent drawing-room one morning, when Arthur\\nHollis entered.\\n\\n\"How does it happen that you are not out for a canter on horseback with\\nour host and Captain Drury?\" she asked. \"This is such a delightful\\nmorning.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, Miss Deane,\" he replied, laughingly, showing a handsome set of\\nwhite teeth, \"I was just bemoaning that fact. But I had some important\\nletters to write, and I was obliged to remain in my room and finish\\nthem.\"\\n\\nAt that moment they saw their young hostess crossing the lawn. Vivian\\nsaw Arthur Hollis look after her with a long, steady, earnest gaze,\\nuntil she was quite out of their sight.\\n\\n\"Are you admiring our young hostess?\" she asked, suddenly, with\\nsomething like a frown on her face.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he answered, frankly. \"I was just thinking that Mrs. Mallard has\\nthe sweetest face and most charming manner of any woman I ever met.\"\\n\\n\"Then you admire her style of beauty?\" said Vivian, a little piqued.\\n\\n\"Yes, very much,\" said Arthur Hollis. \"If I had met her before she\\nmarried our friend Eugene, I think I should have fallen in love with\\nher myself.\"\\n\\nThe words were innocent enough; but Arthur Hollis never for a moment\\ndreamed of the terrible mischief they were to do in the after years.\\n\\nThose words so simply uttered sent a thrill through the heart of the\\ngirl who listened.\\n\\n\"Ah, I have it!\" she said to herself. \"A way is opened to me at last\\nto part Eugene Mallard and his wife. I will encourage Arthur Hollis\\'s\\nadmiration for the beautiful Ida. Men are easily flattered. There is no\\nknowing what the end will be.\"\\n\\nIt was a plot worthy of a fiend incarnate; but this girl, who loved\\nEugene Mallard, would stop at nothing to gain her end.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\\n\\n\\nDuring the fortnight that followed, Arthur Hollis sunned himself each\\nday more and more in Ida\\'s presence.\\n\\nNo one noticed it save Vivian Deane. He saw no danger, nor did she, in\\ntheir companionship. In the meantime, the shadow darkened and deepened.\\nIt was simply the old story in another form.\\n\\nThey were both young. She was gifted with the sweetest grace that ever\\na woman possessed; he was brave, courteous, and noble, with the first\\nthrob of a mighty passion in his heart.\\n\\nWhat usually happens in such cases? He fell desperately in love with\\nIda.\\n\\nAt first Arthur told himself it was pity for her loneliness that\\nactuated him to be always at her side, to make time pass pleasantly for\\nher. He realized, when it was too late, that pity had deepened into a\\nmighty love. And he told himself, in his despair, as the truth forced\\nitself upon him, that he loved her.\\n\\nThe truth came to him like a great shock. He went to Eugene Mallard,\\nand told him he must go away at once. It would have been better if he\\nhad told him why; but he did not.\\n\\n\"I will not listen to such a thing!\" cried Eugene. \"You have promised\\nto stay until the shooting season, and I will hold you to your word.\"\\n\\nIn vain he pleaded. But Eugene was obdurate.\\n\\n\"There is no good reason for your hurrying away,\" said Eugene.\\n\\n\"Then you want me to stay, no matter what happens?\" replied his friend,\\nquickly.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" replied Eugene Mallard; and he thought of Arthur\\'s words for\\nmany a day afterward.\\n\\nArthur Hollis tried to reason with himself, saying that it was better\\nto go. But he was like the moth, who felt insensibly attracted toward\\nthe flame, drawing nearer and nearer, until, like the moth, he would\\nperish in it.\\n\\nAfter his conversation with Eugene, he proceeded to shut his eyes to\\nthe danger.\\n\\nHe was a free-lance. No woman\\'s face had ever touched his heart before,\\nand he was frightened at the intensity of the love that thrilled his\\nheart for beautiful Ida Mallard.\\n\\nHe would sun himself in her presence for one brief fortnight longer,\\nand then go away. Surely it was not much in a life-time. He would not\\ndeprive himself of the one glimpse of sunshine that had drifted into\\nhis life.\\n\\nEvery day found them together.\\n\\nAlthough Ida did not realize what was in his heart, yet she felt\\nintuitively that there was a great change in Arthur Hollis since he had\\nbeen beneath that roof.\\n\\nAlthough he lingered with his feet on the edge of a precipice, yet\\nhe stood face to face with the truth--he loved at last with all the\\npassionate strength of his heart and nature.\\n\\nHe said to himself that if marriages were made in heaven, she was the\\none woman intended for him; she was the only woman in this world that\\nhe could ever love.\\n\\nIf she had only been free, he would have given her his life, his\\nlove--all that he had on earth to give.\\n\\nTo make the situation all the more pitiful, he knew that she was a\\nwife in name only to the man whose name she bore; that she was as far\\nremoved from him as though she dwelt in an opposite part of the world\\nfrom him.\\n\\nShe was so young, so unhappy, he pitied her with all his heart. He was\\nperplexed, agitated.\\n\\nHow he enjoyed the rambles, the rides with her! The sweetest moment of\\nhis life was when he could steal upon her unawares.\\n\\nHe saw no danger, and in the meantime the shadow darkened and deepened.\\nVivian Deane watched them with exultant eyes.\\n\\n\"It will end in an elopement,\" she told herself, triumphantly. \"Their\\nhearts are drifting nearer and nearer together, and the end is not far\\noff.\"\\n\\nEvery day seemed to make Ida more cold and careless, and to leave an\\nadded sternness upon the face of Eugene Mallard, and a harshness in his\\nvoice.\\n\\nHis marriage had been a bitter regret. It was an effort now to even\\nkeep up appearances. He had sealed his misery. There were times when he\\nwished fiercely, miserably, that he could sever that most unhappy bond\\nand set her free.\\n\\nNot all the wealth and luxury and the army of obsequious servants\\ncould make the grand old mansion a home in its true sense.\\n\\nThe young wife plunged into a ceaseless round of frivolity with a\\nreckless _abandon_ quite foreign to her nature.\\n\\nShe accepted every invitation that came to her, and gave in return a\\nseries of entertainments of so extravagant and magnificent a character\\nthat the people around opened their eyes in astonishment, and whispered\\nit was well that Eugene Mallard\\'s pocket was a deep one.\\n\\nBut before long they found something else to comment upon. Wherever\\nIda went, whether she went abroad or entertained at home, at dinner,\\nball, assembly, there, always closely in her train, might be seen the\\nhandsome Arthur Hollis.\\n\\nGossip began to circulate, slight and vague at first, but it soon\\nbecame plainly hinted that Eugene Mallard\\'s beautiful young wife\\nwas flirting with Arthur Hollis--flirting defiantly, desperately,\\nrecklessly. People wondered in indignant astonishment if her husband\\nwas blind or mad.\\n\\nAlmost everybody was discussing the piquant scandal. Even those who had\\nbeen her guests found something to say, declaring that they had noticed\\nit from the first, adding this or that detail as the occasion prompted.\\n\\nThey wondered why some one did not drop a hint to the husband.\\nUnsuspicious by nature, and disregarding the formal calls of society\\nwhenever he could possibly do so, he very seldom accompanied his wife\\non the rounds of gayety on which she had embarked. For weeks neither\\nsignificant words nor glances came to him.\\n\\nBut he did hear of it at last, and then the blow struck him with\\nterrible effect. It was only a few sentences spoken by a couple of\\nladies, and pointed with a venom which only a woman\\'s tongue can give,\\ncoupling the name of his wife with that of Arthur Hollis.\\n\\nBut the import of their words was unmistakable, and the shock seemed\\nmomentarily to stop the young man\\'s breath. The two scandal-mongers\\nlingered over their gossip with keen delight, not knowing that they\\nwere overheard. It was at a garden-party given by Ida. Eugene Mallard\\nhad gone into the grounds to enjoy a cigar in a favorite little retreat\\nwhich few of the guests had as yet discovered. He did not care for the\\ndancing on the lawn, and could not be induced to join the dancers.\\n\\nHidden by a group of laurel-bushes, Eugene\\'s quick ear caught the words\\nof two young girls walking slowly down the path.\\n\\n\"Have you seen our hostess, young Mrs. Mallard?\" asked one of the\\nother. \"I have been searching for her everywhere.\"\\n\\n\"Look for handsome Arthur Hollis,\" returned her companion. \"You will\\nsurely find her with him.\"\\n\\nThe rest of the sentence was uttered in a whisper, but Eugene Mallard\\nheard every word of it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\\n\\n\\nEugene Mallard flung down the cigar which he had just lighted as soon\\nas the girls passed, and made his way from the place.\\n\\nHe resisted the impulse to turn fiercely upon them and demand how they\\ndared to speak of his young wife in that manner. It required all his\\nstrength of will to keep down his anger.\\n\\nHe passed the two girls on the path a moment later, and though they\\ngave a start, they believed that he had not heard their remarks, for he\\ndid not betray his anger in his face.\\n\\nEugene looked about for his wife. His eyes wandered sharply around as\\nhe threaded his way among the dancers. But Ida was not visible.\\n\\nCrossing the lawn, he encountered Vivian Deane and Captain Drury. She\\nwas looking her sweetest in pale-blue summer silk half veiled by white\\nlace and pink rosebuds.\\n\\nHe would have passed them by, with a few forced words of pleasantry,\\nbut Vivian would not have it so.\\n\\n\"You have not danced once this afternoon, Eugene,\" she said; \"and a\\nhost who does his duty should figure in some of the waltzes at least.\\nAre you looking for a partner now? Shall I find you one?\"\\n\\n\"No; thanks, Vivian,\" he answered. \"I am looking for my--my wife. Do\\nyou know where she is?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" returned Vivian. \"I saw her a moment ago. Let me see where it\\nwas. Oh, yes; I remember--down by the clump of oaks. She and Mr. Hollis\\nhad danced four consecutive dances together, and were resting. By the\\nway,\" she added, with a gay little laugh, and something like a pout on\\nher pretty red lips, \"you must tell her not to monopolize Mr. Hollis,\\nEugene. It is too bad of her. It does not give a _single_ girl a fair\\nchance, you know.\"\\n\\nVivian moved away with the captain after giving him that parting shot,\\nand Eugene was not rendered much easier by her last words, although\\nthey were apparently gayly and carelessly spoken.\\n\\nHe walked hurriedly to the further end of the grounds, and there, under\\na huge oak-tree, he caught a glimpse of a filmy white dress.\\n\\nAdvancing, he saw his wife sitting there, with Arthur Hollis beside her.\\n\\nNeither saw him. Ida\\'s eyes were fixed upon a crimson rose she was\\nrecklessly plucking to pieces. She seemed to be hardly heeding her\\ncompanion\\'s words.\\n\\nArthur was leaning back against the oak-tree, looking down at the dark,\\ncurly head, and he was speaking earnestly in a tone hardly above a\\nwhisper.\\n\\nA handsome couple they looked, and surely like nothing so much as\\nlovers.\\n\\nEugene realized this, and a feeling of wrath took possession of him. He\\ndid not love her; in fact, there were times when he told himself that\\nhe hated her with the bitterest kind of hatred; but she bore his name,\\nand she must not be allowed to set the tongues of gossipers wagging.\\n\\nEugene knew that she did not mean anything by receiving the attentions\\nof handsome Arthur Hollis, his friend. She was but a young girl, after\\nall, and she thoughtlessly allowed herself to drift into this most\\nwretched flirtation.\\n\\nHis thoughts went no deeper, no further than that; but that was far\\nenough, and for the sake of her good name, this thoughtless, reckless\\nnonsense must be stopped. He trusted her implicitly, yet he felt a mad,\\nunreasonable rage against the two sitting there.\\n\\nIt was well his will was so strong and his temper so well under\\ncontrol, or he could not have advanced as calmly as he did.\\n\\nIda was dressed in white. It struck him that she looked very beautiful.\\nBut just then her beauty seemed to exasperate and harden her husband\\ntoward her.\\n\\nIda glanced up, and seeing him, started.\\n\\nArthur Hollis appeared a little uncomfortable, but after the first\\nsharp glance, Eugene Mallard did not look at him, feeling that he could\\nnot trust himself to do so. He addressed his wife, looking at her with\\na dark frown on his face.\\n\\n\"Vivian told me you were here,\" he began. \"Are you going to dance the\\nnext set?\"\\n\\nHer face flushed, her hands trembled. Was _he_, her husband, coming to\\nask her to dance with him? His next words showed her how mad she had\\nbeen to cherish such a hope.\\n\\n\"I was going to ask Vivian to dance,\" he said. \"I see there are three\\ncouples standing over there ready to dance. It will require one more\\ncouple to fill up the set.\"\\n\\nWith something like haughty pride, she raised her dark head.\\n\\n\"I shall not dance,\" said Ida, in a cold, bitter voice. \"I am tired.\"\\n\\nArthur Hollis had the grace to laughingly excuse himself. He had been\\nenjoying his _tete-a-tete_, and the sudden appearance of her husband\\non the scene was not welcome. Besides, he had noticed that there was\\nsomething in Eugene Mallard\\'s face which he did not like.\\n\\nArthur Hollis did not speak, and Eugene Mallard waited until he was\\nwell out of hearing. The silence lasted so long that Ida broke it by\\npetulantly saying:\\n\\n\"As I shall not dance this set, would it not be as well for you to find\\nsome one else? The music is just starting.\"\\n\\nHe did not appear to listen to the remark. His eyes were riveted on the\\nlittle satin programme, suspended by a little silver cord at her belt,\\nand he saw the initials of Arthur Hollis written opposite six or eight\\ndances.\\n\\nHis face grew hard, stern, and rigid. Had he been blind not to have\\nnoticed what was going on, when it was so plainly apparent to every one\\nelse?\\n\\n\"I should like to ask something of you,\" he said, pointing to the card.\\n\"I want you to promise me that you will not dance any more with Arthur\\nHollis.\"\\n\\nWith a feeling of mingled rage and pain he saw that Ida turned first\\npale then scarlet. She drew herself up to her full height and looked at\\nhim with a _hauteur_ which she never knew she possessed.\\n\\n\"May I ask why you make such a request?\" she asked, sharply.\\n\\n\"For to-day let it be enough that I make the request. Will you promise\\nme?\"\\n\\nAll the spirit that Ida possessed was up in arms.\\n\\n\"Certainly not,\" Ida responded. \"I would not dream of breaking an\\nengagement for no reason whatever.\"\\n\\nThere was a pause, filled only by the strains of distant music.\\n\\nPaler than usual and with a stern look overspreading his face, Eugene\\nMallard waited for his wife to continue, as she seemed to have\\nsomething more to say.\\n\\n\"If you objected to your friend dancing with me, you--you should have\\nmade the request before the engagements were made.\"\\n\\nHe looked at her angrily, his fair, handsome face flushing.\\n\\n\"A half dozen engagements should not have been made,\" he returned.\\n\"People will certainly comment upon it. They are already whispering of\\nmy friend\\'s attention to you.\"\\n\\nA strange look which he could not analyze crossed the beautiful face.\\n\\n\"You must stop this gossip,\" he went on, \"or I will take measures to do\\nso. I have made a request of you, and shown you why I made it. Will you\\ngrant it--for your own sake?\"\\n\\n\"I refuse!\" she repeated. \"I am sorry that you do not think me capable\\nof protecting my own name--and yours.\"\\n\\nWith something like a muttered imprecation on his lips, he turned on\\nhis heel, and strode rapidly from her side.\\n\\n\"Fool that I was!\" he muttered, clinching his hands together. \"To save\\nher honor I married her. But what does she care for my honor?\"\\n\\nThe breech between them grew wider than ever now.\\n\\nIda danced with Arthur Hollis, and the tongues of the gossips wagged.\\nIf Eugene Mallard heard, he paid no heed. Strange thoughts were passing\\nthrough his mind.\\n\\nAll unmindful of what Eugene Mallard had to say to his wife, Arthur\\nHollis danced with her, and hovered more closely than ever by her side.\\n\\nHe was growing desperate. His stay was drawing to a close. He meant\\nto make the most of the few hours of sunshine and happiness before he\\nturned his back on all that made life worth the living.\\n\\nAt the finish of one of the dances a messenger-boy was seen approaching\\nwith a telegram.\\n\\n\"For Mr. Arthur Hollis,\" he called.\\n\\nMechanically Arthur held out his hand. It was a dispatch requiring his\\nimmediate presence in Baltimore to attend to some urgent business.\\n\\n\"Have you bad news?\" asked Ida, turning to him; for she saw his face\\nhad grown very pale.\\n\\n\"Yes--no,\" he answered, incoherently, a troubled look coming into his\\neyes. \"I must go away.\" He did not look at her as he uttered the words.\\n\"I must go within the hour,\" he said, huskily. \"Come down by the brook\\nwhere we have passed so many happy hours. I should like to say good-bye\\nto you there.\"\\n\\nFor a moment she hesitated; then seeing the sorrowful look on his face,\\nshe quietly allowed him to lead her down the path toward the brook.\\n\\nIn silence they walked through the sunshine, heedless that there were\\ntwo pairs of eyes following them--Vivian Deane\\'s from one part of the\\ngrounds, and Eugene Mallard\\'s from another.\\n\\nVivian turned and followed them. That was the beginning of the tragedy\\nthat darkened three lives.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XL.\\n\\n\\nSlowly Ida and Arthur Hollis walked together over the beautiful green\\nlawn, Vivian Deane creeping like the shadow of fate after them.\\n\\nArthur seated Ida in her favorite nook on the mossy stone. For a moment\\nneither of them spoke; then he suddenly caught her little hand in his.\\nIda did not know why she trembled, why her hand grew cold in his clasp.\\n\\nThere was not a cloud in the blue sky overhead. The cool, sweet breeze\\nshook the rose leaves and scattered them on the grass; the leaves of\\nthe oak-trees stirred on the great boughs. A calm, sweet and solemn in\\nits beauty, stole over them.\\n\\n\"Ida,\" he whispered, hoarsely, \"did ever a great pity fill your heart\\nfor any one? If so, let pity fill it now for me, for I am in need of\\nit.\"\\n\\n\"Why?\" she asked, looking wonderingly up at him.\\n\\n\"How I shall look back to this hour when I am gone!\" he said, brokenly.\\n\\n\"When I am gone!\" The words had a sad murmur in them, like the fall of\\nautumn leaves. They pierced the very heart of the girl who heard them.\\n\\n\"When you are gone?\" she repeated. \"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"I am going away within the hour,\" he said. \"The telegram I received\\ncalls me back to Baltimore by the first train,\" he added.\\n\\nInvoluntarily Ida drew closer to him, her face paling. Suddenly the\\nlight went out of the sun, the glory faded from the blue sky; the music\\nof the birds was hushed, the bitterness of death seemed to have fallen\\nover her heart.\\n\\n\"Going away?\" She repeated the words over and over again, but she could\\nnot realize their meaning.\\n\\n\"I--I have been so happy, I forgot you would have to go away,\" she\\nsaid, slowly.\\n\\n\"I am going down to Central America. I may die of fever and never come\\nback,\" he answered, with passionate pain in his voice. \"If I am spared\\nto return, it may not be for years. I will have passed out of your\\nthoughts by that time. You will have forgotten the pleasant hours we\\nspent together, forgotten our rambles through the sunny hours. You will\\nhave grown into a woman of the world by that time. You have not begun\\nlife yet.\"\\n\\n\"I feel as though I had finished with it,\" she murmured.\\n\\nShe did not try to check the words that came throbbing to her lips.\\n\\n\"I wish you had not come into my life only to go out of it,\" she added,\\nwith passionate pain.\\n\\nHe looked at her, and strong man though he was, his lips trembled. She\\nhad raised her face to his, and she looked so beautiful, so unhappy,\\nthat he turned away with a groan which came from the very depths of his\\nheart.\\n\\nVivian Deane had crept near enough to hear the first words that had\\npassed between them. She knew that he had received a telegram calling\\nhim away. He had either taken Ida Mallard down to the brook-side to say\\ngood-bye, or to urge her to elope with him. Most likely the latter.\\n\\nShe would go and fetch Eugene. He should be a silent witness to the\\nscene; then her vengeance would be complete.\\n\\nShe knew his pride, his temper. She knew he would not raise his voice\\nto utter one word to stay her steps. He would spurn her, he would force\\nher to go.\\n\\nVivian hurried back to the dancers on the lawn. Eugene Mallard was\\nstanding apart from his guests. She glided up to him and laid a little\\nwhite hand upon his arm.\\n\\n\"Eugene,\" she said, in a voice which trembled with excitement, \"I have\\nalways been your true friend. If I saw you in danger, my first impulse\\nwould be to save you. If I saw an enemy pointing a deadly arrow at your\\nheart, I would try to turn it aside. If I saw a dark cloud hanging over\\nyou, my first impulse would be to warn you.\"\\n\\n\"I anticipate what you are going to say, Vivian,\" he broke in, with\\nan expression of annoyance on his face. \"You are going to repeat some\\ngossip to me, and I will say, before you begin, that I do not care to\\nhear it.\"\\n\\n\"If you will not heed the words of warning of one who wishes you well,\\nyou must submit to the jeers of the whole country. I advise you to go\\nto the brook-side, where your wife is saying farewell to Arthur Hollis;\\nor perhaps she is going with him.\"\\n\\nShe saw the look that passed over his face as she turned swiftly and\\nhurried away. He could not have answered her if his life had depended\\nupon it. Glancing back over her shoulder, she saw that he had strolled\\noff in the direction which she had indicated.\\n\\n\"He will catch them making love to each other, and then--Ah, well, we\\nshall see!\"\\n\\nIda and Arthur had walked in silence by the brook, and they stood\\nbeside it for some moments without speaking; then suddenly Arthur\\nHollis turned toward her.\\n\\n\"Say that you will miss me when I am gone,\" he murmured, with emotion.\\n\\n\"You know that I will,\" she answered. \"But for you, my life here would\\nhave been very lonely.\"\\n\\n\"Do you really mean that?\" he asked, quickly.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" she returned, with something very like a sob on her lips.\\n\\nImpetuously he caught the little white hand that hung by her side.\\n\\n\"Those words will linger in my memory until the day I die!\" he cried,\\nhuskily. \"Ida, I am going away. You will never see me in this world\\nagain. I shall never come back.\"\\n\\nShe looked at him with her great dark eyes.\\n\\n\"It breaks my heart to say farewell,\" he continued, huskily, \"for when\\nI leave you, Ida, I go out into the darkness of death.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, do not say that!\" she cried.\\n\\n\"Yes, the hour has come when I must tell you,\" he answered. \"It will\\nease my heart. Only forgive and forget me. Oh, how am I to say good-bye\\nto you?\" he asked, sharply, looking, with desperation in his eyes,\\nat the lovely pale face. \"I have lived under the same roof with you.\\nI have been thrown into your society day by day, yet I have kept my\\nsecret in my own heart. Now I am going away, and I will tell you the\\ntruth--I love you, Ida--I love you!\"\\n\\nHe caught her hands in his, and she was too bewildered and dazed to\\nwithdraw them.\\n\\n\"You must forgive me!\" he cried. \"Have pity on me, if my words do not\\nplease you!\"\\n\\nShe was carried away by his reckless impetuosity, and was too much\\nsurprised to interrupt him. She had not even recovered herself\\nsufficiently to withdraw her hands from his. All she knew, in her\\nbewilderment, was, that he was kneeling upon the grass at her feet,\\nwith his head bent, and that hot, passionate tears were falling from\\nhis eyes.\\n\\n\"I have brought you here because I could not bear the pain any longer.\\nI must speak to you or die. I love you! Ah, Heaven knows how I love\\nyou!\"\\n\\nShe had no power to stop the torrent of words that fell from his lips.\\n\\n\"You will no doubt wonder how I dare say this to you,\" he went on,\\nbrokenly, \"but my answer is--love dares anything. It must express\\nitself in action or words. No mortal can keep it back.\"\\n\\nShe tried to check him, but it was impossible.\\n\\n\"Hush--hush!\" was all she could say.\\n\\n\"I know the gulf that lies between us,\" he went on: \"I realize that it\\ncan never be bridged over. If I had met you first, I feel all would\\nhave ended differently. You would have loved me as I love you. I feel\\nit--I know it.\"\\n\\nAt that moment Eugene Mallard, who had hurried down the path at the\\nsuggestion of Vivian Deane, arrived upon the scene.\\n\\nOnly the tall lilac bushes sheltered him from the two who stood by the\\nbrook-side. For a moment he was horrified at what he saw and heard. He\\nstood fairly rooted to the spot. His first impulse was to dash in upon\\nthem, fling Arthur Hollis to the earth, and beat his very life out.\\n\\nHis next impulse was to rush to the house for his revolver, return with\\nit, and shoot his false friend before his guilty wife\\'s eyes.\\n\\nHe acted upon the latter impulse, turned on his heel, and a moment\\nlater, white as death, he dashed into the house and ran up a rear\\nstair-way to his room.\\n\\nHe did not love the girl who bore his name, but she should learn, even\\nif it were at the cost of a life, what it meant to drag his name, his\\nhonor, through the mire.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLI.\\n\\n\\nAlthough scarcely five minutes had elapsed since Eugene Mallard dashed\\ninto the house in search of his revolver, when he returned to the\\nbrook-side neither his wife nor Arthur Hollis was to be seen.\\n\\nHis rage was so great that he could scarcely contain himself. In his\\npresent state of mind he did not dare return to his guests, lest his\\nemotion should betray him.\\n\\nHe thought they were planning an elopement; but he would nip that in\\nthe bud.\\n\\nThe woman to whom he had given his name should not disgrace him. He\\ndetermined upon that as he hurried up a rear stair-way to his wife\\'s\\napartments to verify his suspicions.\\n\\nTo his utter surprise, as he flung open the door, he saw her sitting\\nby the window. She sprung to her feet, looking at him with widely\\ndistended eyes.\\n\\nIt was the first time that her husband had ever crossed the threshold\\nof her apartments.\\n\\nHe entered the room, closed the door behind him, and stood with folded\\narms before her.\\n\\nHusband and wife looked at each other.\\n\\nIt was he who broke the awful silence. He strode up to her, and seized\\nher wrist in a vise-like grasp.\\n\\n\"There is little use in making a preliminary speech,\" he cried,\\nhoarsely. \"I will come to the point at once!\"\\n\\nHis face was ghastly, his lips trembled with uncontrollable rage.\\n\\nIda, pale, terrified, wondering, gazed at him with undisguised terror\\nin her eyes.\\n\\n\"What is it?\" she gasped.\\n\\n\"You guilty woman!\" cried Eugene Mallard--\"you cruel, guilty woman, I\\nhave interrupted you in your preparation for flight, it seems!\"\\n\\nHis stern face, the anger that shone in his eyes, and the harsh voice\\nfrightened her. She shrunk back as though he had struck her. Her lips\\nparted as though she would speak; but all sound died away on them.\\n\\n\"It is time,\" said Eugene Mallard, \"that we came to a clear\\nunderstanding. In every way you have deceived me! I have been fatally\\nbetrayed! Your shameless flirtation has tarnished my name and lowered\\nmy position! I am ashamed to look men in the face! Where is he?\" he\\ndemanded, looking about him, as though he expected to see Arthur Hollis\\nin the room.\\n\\n\"Down by the brook,\" she faltered.\\n\\nEugene laughed a harsh, satirical laugh.\\n\\n\"He must have seen me coming while he waited there for you, and fled\\nfrom my wrath.\" He turned on his heel. \"I repeat, if you stir from this\\nroom until I give you leave, it will end in a tragedy!\"\\n\\nIn his anger, he did not see that he was trampling under foot a noble\\nheart. If she had been able to calmly explain to him just what had\\noccurred, she might have been saved. She attempted to speak, but he\\nheld up his hand.\\n\\n\"Not one word!\" he cried. \"I will not listen!\"\\n\\nHe turned suddenly, hurried from the room, closed the door after him,\\nand went quickly to his library, where he could be alone.\\n\\nIda, left alone, reeled into the nearest chair. She shook as if in an\\nague; she was cold, and her head reeled. Her keen pain and agony kept\\nher from fainting.\\n\\nShe tried to imagine her future life. What was Eugene Mallard about to\\ndo? Her future was now ruined, sacrificed. Eugene Mallard had been cold\\nand indifferent to her before, now he hated her.\\n\\nHe said she was to remain in that room until he should return. She\\nflung herself face downward upon the floor. He had called her guilty\\nand cruel; he had vented his rage upon her. Her brain was dizzy with\\nthe unusual excitement.\\n\\nWhen Vivian Deane glided into Ida\\'s room to find out what was going on,\\nto see whether Ida had really eloped, she found her in a deep swoon.\\nShe did not call the servants, but set about reviving her herself.\\n\\nIda lay white and still as one dead. Above her bent Vivian Deane,\\nhalf terrified at the result of her work. Very soon her labors were\\nrewarded, and Ida opened her large, dark eyes.\\n\\n\"Vivian--Vivian!\" she murmured, catching at the arms of her false\\nfriend, her teeth chattering.\\n\\nThe blinding tears that now fell from Ida\\'s eyes was a mercy sent\\ndirectly from Heaven, for they saved the hapless young wife from going\\nmad.\\n\\n\"Something has gone wrong with you, my dear,\" said Vivian, in her\\nsweetest, most cooing voice. \"Tell me what it is, Ida, dear. Let me\\nconsole and comfort you.\"\\n\\nAnother fit of sobbing more violent than the first, and Ida threw\\nherself into the arms of her treacherous friend, sobbing out:\\n\\n\"Oh! Vivian, I must tell some one.\"\\n\\nIn a voice that shook with emotion, she proceeded to confide to her\\nenemy what had happened down by the brook-side, adding that her husband\\nhad discovered it in some way, and accused her of encouraging Arthur\\nHollis.\\n\\n\"Even if you had given him encouragement, no one could have blamed\\nyou,\" Vivian said in a soft, purring voice, \"for your husband\\'s neglect\\nhas been noticeable by every one!\"\\n\\n\"But I did not encourage him!\" cried Ida, in agony. \"He was pleasant\\ncompany, but I thought no more of him, even though I spent so much of\\nmy time in his society, than I did of Captain Drury, or any of the\\nother guests beneath this roof. Oh! I do wish I were dead--I do--I do!\"\\n\\nIn this exaggerated feeling of one ill in body and in mind, in a state\\nof nervous tension, a true friend would have shown the unhappy Ida that\\nher position was not so desperate and hopeless as she imagined. Matters\\ncould not, however, be carried to an extremity without an explanation.\\n\\n\"He bid me to remain here until he should return,\" sobbed Ida. \"What do\\nyou suppose he means to do?\"\\n\\n\"Do you really want my honest opinion?\" asked Vivian, with a steely\\nglitter in her blue eyes.\\n\\n\"Yes!\" said the young wife, anxiously, fairly holding her breath in\\nsuspense.\\n\\n\"Well, then, my dear, if you must have it, here it is: I, who know the\\nfierce temper of the Mallards, say to you that I think he intends to\\ncall all the guests here, to openly denounce you before them, and then\\nturn you away from his house!\"\\n\\nThe face of the girl-wife who listened grew ghastly.\\n\\n\"I would never stay beneath this roof to face his anger,\" said Vivian,\\nher eyes glistening. \"I would gather up what money and jewels I could\\nlay my hands on, and run away--go as far away as possible.\"\\n\\n\"Would you?\" cried Ida, in a hushed, awful voice.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" advised Vivian, firmly. \"And every moment of delay brings you\\nnearer and nearer to face the terrible ordeal that I am sure he intends\\nto mete out to you!\"\\n\\nIda rose suddenly to her feet\\n\\n\"I will do as you advise, Vivian,\" she whispered, her dark eyes filled\\nwith terror. \"I will fly at once!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLII.\\n\\n\\nVivian Deane looked down at the cowering girl at her feet. It seemed to\\nher then that her triumph was complete. She could scarcely keep back\\nthe cry of exultation that rose to her lips.\\n\\n\"How shall I leave the house without being seen?\" whispered Ida,\\npiteously.\\n\\n\"Leave that to me,\" murmured Vivian. \"I am very sorry for you, Ida, and\\nI will do all I can to aid you in this, your hour of greatest sorrow.\"\\n\\n\"You are, indeed, a true friend to me,\" sobbed Ida. \"I shall never,\\nnever forget your kindness.\"\\n\\nVivian looked a trifle uncomfortable at these words of unmerited\\npraise. She dared not remain longer with Ida, for she knew that two or\\nthree partners would be looking for her.\\n\\n\"Stay here for at least fifteen minutes,\" she said, eagerly, \"and by\\nthat time I will join you, and tell you what plans I have made for you.\"\\n\\nIda could not think for herself, her brain was so benumbed. She could\\nonly nod in silence.\\n\\nScarcely five minutes had elapsed since Vivian had quitted the\\n_boudoir_, until Eugene Mallard again knocked for admittance at the\\ndoor.\\n\\nThere was no answer. He turned the knob, entered, and found his young\\nwife lying senseless upon the carpet. For the second time, Ida had\\ngiven away to the awful agony that consumed her. Among those at the\\n_fete_ was a young doctor. Eugene summoned him hastily.\\n\\n\"Dear me, this is quite serious!\" exclaimed the doctor, as he bent over\\nthe prostrate form which Eugene had borne to a couch. \"Your wife has\\nbrain fever. It is a serious case, I fear.\"\\n\\nThe garden-party broke up quite suddenly. The news that Mrs. Mallard\\nhad been taken ill was rumored among the revelers, and silently but\\nquickly the guests took their departure, all save Vivian Deane.\\n\\nShe went up to Eugene, and laid a hand on his arm.\\n\\n\"Let me remain and nurse my dear friend Ida,\" she pleaded. \"Do not\\nrefuse, I beg of you!\"\\n\\n\"Let it be as the doctor says,\" answered Eugene.\\n\\nBut the physician shook his head decisively.\\n\\n\"This is a case requiring the most competent nurses. I am sorry to\\nrefuse you, Miss Deane, but in this instance I must do so.\"\\n\\nVivian controlled the anger that leaped into her heart.\\n\\n\"You certainly mean well,\" added the doctor, \"but in such a case as\\nthis even her nearest relatives are not to be allowed in the sick-room.\"\\n\\nVivian was obliged to swallow her chagrin as best she could. If she\\nhad been allowed her way, the young wife who had come between her love\\nand herself would never rise from her bed.\\n\\n\"When she is convalescing I will visit her,\" she said to herself.\\n\\nAs she had no excuse to remain longer in the house, she was obliged to\\ntake her departure along with the other guests.\\n\\nWhen Eugene Mallard had hurried to his room, after bidding Ida to\\nremain there until his return, it was his intention to go to his room\\nfor writing materials, and returning to Ida, force from her a written\\nconfession of her love for his friend, and her intention to elope with\\nhim.\\n\\nUnder the circumstances, he could not very well carry his plan into\\nexecution. His rage against his hapless young wife turned to pity when\\nhe saw her lying there so helplessly before him.\\n\\nDuring the fortnight that followed, the servants, who knew of their\\nmaster\\'s estrangement from his young wife, and how little he cared\\nfor her, were greatly surprised to find themselves banished from the\\nsick-room, while Eugene Mallard took possession of it.\\n\\nThe fact was, he was puzzled at her raving. Sometimes, when taking\\nthe place of the trained nurse for an hour, he was troubled beyond\\nexpression to hear her go over again and again the scene that had taken\\nplace by the brook.\\n\\nIn her delirium, Ida vehemently repulsed Arthur Hollis, demanding of\\nhim how it was that he dared speak a word of love to her, the wife of\\nanother.\\n\\nThen the scene would change, and she would fancy herself once more in\\nher own room, falling on her knees and crying out to Heaven that she\\ncould not bear her husband\\'s coldness.\\n\\nOften would Eugene listen intently while Ida clasped her hands and\\nmoaned:\\n\\n\"Oh, Eugene! Eugene! will I ever be more to you than I am now? I love\\nyou! Yes, I love you, but you will never know it! If you only knew it,\\nyou would be surprised. A wife never loved a husband more dearly, more\\ndevotedly than I love you. I would have devoted my whole life to you.\\nI would have died for you! Every beat of my heart, every thought of my\\nmind, every action of my life is for you! I love you as no one else\\never will, as no one has loved you! You may live many years, happy,\\nflattered by the women of the world, but no love like mine will ever\\ncome to you. The wife who is to you as the dirt beneath your feet is\\nthe truest friend you have!\"\\n\\nEugene Mallard looked terribly distressed as he listened.\\n\\n\"Ida, my dear wife, listen to me,\" he would say. \"I--I--shall try very\\nhard to be kinder to you than I have been. Do you hear me, do you\\nunderstand?\"\\n\\nThere was no gleam of love in the pale face; no light such as he had\\nthought his words would bring there; no gleam of joy. She did not seem\\nto understand him. He said to himself that he must be cautious; that he\\nmust not distress her by speaking words that would give her hope.\\n\\nThe news of the illness of Eugene Mallard\\'s young wife had traversed\\nfar beyond the small Virginia town. He was well known in New York, and\\nthe papers of the metropolis copied the bit of news; but in doing so,\\nthey made a great mistake. The items read that the young wife of Eugene\\nMallard had died from the effects of brain fever.\\n\\nMiss Fernly read the article, and without delay she wrote to Eugene\\nMallard.\\n\\nIn one part of her letter she said:\\n\\n \"I should never have written you the following if the wife whom you\\n had wedded through _my_ mistake had lived. But now that she is gone,\\n I will tell you the truth--that hapless deed came very near costing\\n your poor Hildegarde her life. From the time of your marriage to the\\n present, she has never been the same. She loved you then, she still\\n loves you.\\n\\n \"This is what I would advise you to do: wait a reasonable length of\\n time, and then come and claim Hildegarde, and this time nothing shall\\n happen to prevent the marriage of you two whom Heaven had intended for\\n each other. I know Hildegarde is breaking her heart day by day, hour\\n by hour, for love of you.\\n\\n \"I urge you to come to her just as soon as you think it prudent, as I\\n think it is my duty to warn you that Hildegarde is fading away before\\n our very eyes, and your presence is the only thing that can save her\\n life.\\n\\n \"I here inclose you a small portrait of her I had taken only a little\\n while ago. Her face is as sweet as a flower, but, ah, me! one can not\\n help but read the sadness in every line of it.\"\\n\\nIt was just at the time when Eugene Mallard was feeling kinder toward\\nhis wife than ever that he received Miss Fernly\\'s letter inclosing\\nHildegarde\\'s picture. He had done his best to try to crush out his\\nhopeless love for one from whom Heaven had so strangely parted him.\\n\\nGreat drops of perspiration stood out on his brow as he folded the\\nletter and turned the picture face downward on his desk.\\n\\nIt seemed to Eugene that the bitter waves of death were sweeping over\\nhim. It was the reopening of the old wound in his heart that he prayed\\nHeaven to heal. He loved Hildegarde with all the strength of his\\nmanhood. He wished that he were dead. The pain seemed greater than he\\ncould bear. He found that he still loved sweet Hildegarde; but he was\\nbound to another in honor and conscience. He would try to do his duty\\ntoward the one who bore his name.\\n\\nHe took the letter to the open fire-place, where a log fire burned\\nlazily, and knelt down before it, holding it to the flame. Red tongues\\nof fire caught at it gleefully, and the next instant it was a heap of\\nashes in one corner of the grate.\\n\\nThen he held out the picture to the flames, but involuntarily he drew\\nit back. He could not allow it to burn. It seemed to him that his own\\nheart would burn first.\\n\\n\"Heaven give me strength to destroy it!\" he cried. \"I dare not trust\\nmyself to keep it. It will drive me mad!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLIII.\\n\\n\\nThe flames touched the portrait, and with a cry Eugene Mallard hastily\\ndrew it back.\\n\\n\"No, no--a thousand times no!\" It would be as easy to burn the living,\\nbeating heart in his bosom.\\n\\nWhile he had the strength, he hurried to his writing-desk, placed it in\\na pigeon-hole, shut down the lid, and turned the key. Then he buried\\nhis face in his hands.\\n\\nHe ruminated upon the strangeness of the position he was placed in.\\nBoth of these young girls loved him, while he loved but one of them,\\nand the one whom he loved so deeply could never be anything in this\\nworld to him. He wondered in what way he had offended Heaven that such\\na fate should be meted out to him.\\n\\nAt that moment quite a thrilling scene was transpiring at the railway\\nstation of the little Virginia town.\\n\\nThe New York Express, which had just steamed in, stood before it, and\\nfrom one of the drawing-room cars there stepped a handsome man dressed\\nin the height of fashion.\\n\\nHe sauntered into the waiting-room, looking about him as though in\\nsearch of the ticket-agent.\\n\\nA woman entered the depot at that moment carrying a little child in her\\narms. She recognized the man at a single glance.\\n\\n\"Why, Mr. Royal Ainsley!\" she cried, \"is this indeed you returning to\\nyour old home?\"\\n\\nTurning hastily around at the mention of his name, he beheld Mrs.\\nLester standing before him.\\n\\n\"Yes; I have returned like a bad penny, Mrs. Lester,\" he said, with a\\nlight, flippant laugh. \"But, judging from the expression on your face,\\nyou are not glad to see me.\"\\n\\n\"I have not said so,\" she answered.\\n\\n\"Sit down, Mrs. Lester,\" he said, flinging himself down on one of the\\nbenches. \"I should like to inquire of you about the women-folk of the\\nvillage.\"\\n\\nThe woman sat down beside him, in obedience to his request.\\n\\n\"There is very little to tell,\" she answered; \"everything in our\\nvillage moves on about the same, year in and year out. Nothing of\\nimportance has taken place, except the marriage of your cousin, Eugene\\nMallard.\"\\n\\n\"Ha! ha! ha! So my fastidious cousin has changed his name from Royal\\nAinsley to that of Eugene Mallard to please his uncle, has he? Well,\\nI read of it in one of the New York papers, but I scarcely credited\\nit. Between you and me, Mrs. Lester, that was a mighty mean piece of\\nwork--the old fool leaving his entire fortune to him, and cutting me\\noff without a cent.\"\\n\\n\"Every one knows that you were warned of what was to come unless you\\nmended your ways,\" answered the woman.\\n\\n\"Bah! I never thought for a moment that the old fool would keep his\\nword,\" retorted the other. \"But you say that my cousin is wedded. That\\nis indeed news to me. Whom did he wed--Vivian Deane?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no,\" she answered, \"not Miss Deane. Every one in the village\\nprophesied that he wouldn\\'t wed her, although she was so infatuated\\nwith him.\"\\n\\n\"I suppose she is an heiress,\" said Ainsley, savagely knocking the\\nashes off his cigar. \"It\\'s easy enough to marry another fortune if you\\nhave one already.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know if she is an heiress,\" returned Mrs. Lester; \"but she\\'s\\na real lady. Any one can see that. But I fear that he is in great\\ndanger of losing her. She is now very low with brain fever, and it is\\ndoubtful whether she will live.\"\\n\\n\"Humph!\" he muttered. \"My visit here is most inopportune then. I\\nwanted to see my cousin, and strike him for the loan of a few thousand\\ndollars. He won\\'t be in very good humor now to accede to my request. I\\nthink I\\'ll keep shady and wait a fortnight before seeing him. But who\\nis _this_?\" he cried, looking at the child she carried in her arms. \"I\\nunderstood that your baby died.\"\\n\\n\"So it did,\" replied Mrs. Lester. \"This is the little foundling whom\\nwe are about to adopt. My husband brought it to me from a foundling\\nasylum.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I do declare!\" said Ainsley. \"That\\'s quite a risky operation,\\ntaking a little waif into your home, when you don\\'t know its parents.\"\\n\\n\"But I _do_ know its mother,\" she answered. \"I wrote and found out\\nall about its mother. She was a young girl who was taken ill in the\\nstreets. A poor family permitted her to be brought into their house,\\nand there her babe was born. The young mother was so ill that the babe\\nwas taken to the foundling asylum by the doctor who attended her, where\\nit could have constant attention, for its little life was despaired\\nof. By a strange mistake, word was sent to the mother that the little\\none had died. But the baby rallied and recovered. Almost heart-broken\\nover the news of its death, the young mother disappeared. There was\\nno one so interested as to make search for her, and tell her that her\\nlittle one had been spared. In her flight she left behind her a package\\nwhich contained some articles that may lead to her identity, if the\\nchild should ever want to find her hapless mother when she grows to\\nwomanhood. I have them with me now. Do let me show them to you, Mr.\\nAinsley.\"\\n\\nAt that moment the little one, who had been sleeping, slowly opened its\\ngreat, dark, solemn eyes, looked up into the face of Royal Ainsley, and\\nuttered a plaintive little sob.\\n\\nIt was not often that he noticed little children--indeed, he had an\\naversion to them--but he could not understand the impulse that made\\nhim bend forward and look with interest into the flower-like little\\nface.\\n\\nWhere had he seen just such a face? The great, dark, solemn eyes, so\\nlike purple <DW29>s, held him spell-bound.\\n\\nAn impulse which he could not control or define caused him to reach out\\nhis trembling hand and touch the waxen little fingers, and the contact\\nmade the blood rush through his veins like fire. He tried to speak, but\\nhis tongue seemed too thick and heavy to perform its functions.\\n\\nThe woman did not notice his agitation. She was busily engaged in\\nunwrapping a small parcel which she had tied up in oil silk.\\n\\nThen, to his astonished gaze, Mrs. Lester held up before him a\\nbeautiful bracelet made of tiny pink sea-shells, with a heavy gold\\nclasp, upon which was engraved, \"From R. to I.\"\\n\\nIf Mrs. Lester had but looked at him, she would have seen that his face\\nhad grown ghastly.\\n\\nAt a glance he recognized the bracelet as one which he had designed\\nand presented to Ida May, at Newport, when he believed her to be the\\nheiress of the wealthy Mays.\\n\\n\"That is not all,\" said Mrs. Lester, holding up a man\\'s pocket-book,\\nwhich he recognized as his own---the identical one he had sent up to\\nIda May by the porter, with a little change in it, on the morning he\\ndeserted her.\\n\\nAgain he opened his mouth to speak; but no sound issued from his\\nlips. The pocket-book contained only a part of a sleeve-link that had\\nbelonged to himself, the other part of the link was in his pocket at\\nthat moment.\\n\\nIn a flash, the truth came to him--this little one was Ida May\\'s child.\\n\\nHe now recalled the appealing letters she had written to him at the\\nhotel after he had deserted her. He had never answered them, for by\\nthat time he was trying to win the beautiful heiress, Florence St.\\nJohn. He had told Ida May that his marriage to her was not legal, while\\nin truth it was as binding as Church and State could make it.\\n\\nHe had cast all upon the throw of a dice, and it would never do for the\\npoor young girl whom he had married to come between him and the young\\ngirl whom he was about to win.\\n\\nHe had resolved upon a desperate scheme to gain a fortune, by deluding\\nthe young girl whom he had made his wife into believing that she was\\nnot such, and going through the ceremony with the heiress, Florence St.\\nJohn.\\n\\nBut Fate had snatched the beautiful Florence St. John from his grasp\\njust as he was about to wed her. Her brother came on the scene, and\\nRoyal Ainsley beat a hasty retreat, as he had commenced to inquire into\\nhis antecedents.\\n\\nAll these thoughts flashed through his brain in an instant. Then he\\nrealized that Mrs. Lester was speaking to him.\\n\\n\"A pretty baby, is she not?\" said the woman, holding the infant toward\\nhim. \"But we have decided not to keep her, after all. I am going to\\ntake the first train to New York, and return the baby to the foundling\\nasylum, though Heaven knows I shall miss her sorely. We are too poor to\\nkeep her.\"\\n\\nRoyal Ainsley turned toward her with strange eagerness.\\n\\n\"What do you say if I take your charge off your hands?\" he asked,\\nhuskily.\\n\\n\"You, Mr. Ainsley?\" exclaimed the woman, amazed. \"Why, what in the\\nworld could _you_, a young bachelor, do with a baby?\"\\n\\n\"I will give you one hundred dollars to give me the child. Is it a\\nbargain, Mrs. Lester? Speak quickly, before I change my mind!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLIV.\\n\\n\\nRoyal Ainsley leaned forward, and caught Mrs. Lester\\'s arm, saying\\nhastily:\\n\\n\"I repeat, that you shall have one hundred dollars if you will but give\\nthe child into my custody.\"\\n\\n\"Again I ask, what could you, a bachelor, do with it, Mr. Ainsley?\"\\nsaid Mrs. Lester.\\n\\nHe had an answer ready for her.\\n\\n\"I know a family who lost a little one, and would be only too delighted\\nto take the infant and give it a good home.\"\\n\\nMrs. Lester breathed a sigh of relief.\\n\\n\"I am very poor, as you know very well, Mr. Ainsley,\" she answered,\\n\"and I can not refuse your kind offer. Take the little one with\\nwelcome. Only be sure that it is a good home you consign it to.\"\\n\\nHe counted out the money and handed it to her, and she resigned the\\ninfant to his arms. At that moment they heard the shriek of the\\nincoming express.\\n\\n\"That is the train I was going to take,\" she said, \"and now I am out\\nthe price of my ticket, which I bought in advance.\"\\n\\n\"If you will give it to me, I will use it,\" he said.\\n\\nShe handed him the ticket, and in another moment Mrs. Lester saw him\\nboard the train with the child.\\n\\n\"I wonder if I have done right or wrong,\" she thought, a scared look\\ncoming into her face. \"It was all done so quickly that I had not the\\ntime to consider the matter. But this much I do know; I have the\\nhundred dollars in my pocket, and that is a God-send to me. We need the\\nmoney badly just now.\"\\n\\nShe turned and walked slowly away; but somehow she did not seem quite\\neasy regarding the fate of the little child.\\n\\n\"I ought to have asked him the name of the family to whom he was going\\nto take the baby,\" she mused; \"then I could have written to them to be\\nvery careful, and to bring her up to be a good and true woman. I shall\\ncertainly ask him all about it the very next time I see him--that is,\\nif I ever _do_ see him.\"\\n\\nMeanwhile the train thundered on, carrying Royal Ainsley and the child\\naway. It was hard to keep back the expression of mingled hatred and\\nrage with which Royal Ainsley regarded the infant he held in his arms.\\nHe knew full well that the child was his own, but he had no love for\\nit. If it had died then and there, that fact would have afforded him\\nmuch satisfaction.\\n\\nBut one course presented itself. He would take it to New York, and once\\nthere, he would have no further trouble with it--he would manage to\\nlose it. Many waifs were found on the doorsteps, and no one ever could\\ntrace their parentage, or whose hand had placed them there.\\n\\nIn all probability he would never run across Ida May again. She\\nbelieved her child dead.\\n\\nWhile these thoughts were flitting through his brain, the little one\\ncommenced to cry. Its piteous wails attracted the attention of more\\nthan one person in the car.\\n\\n\"Mother,\" said a buxom young woman sitting opposite, \"I am sure that\\nyoung man is a widower, left with the little child, and he is taking it\\nto his folks. You see he is in deep mourning.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll bet that baby\\'s hungry, mother, and I\\'ll bet, too, that he hasn\\'t\\na nursing-bottle to feed it from.\"\\n\\n\"You can depend upon it that he has one,\" remarked her mother. \"Every\\nfather knows that much about babies.\"\\n\\n\"Of course he has it in his pocket; he never came away without one; but\\nhe is so deeply engrossed in his own thoughts that he does not hear the\\nbaby. Don\\'t you think you ought to give him a little reminder of it?\"\\nsaid her daughter, thoughtfully. \"You\\'re an elderly woman, and can do\\nit.\"\\n\\n\"He might tell me to mind my own business,\" said the elder woman. \"Some\\nstrangers don\\'t take kindly to other people meddling in their affairs.\"\\n\\nAs the plaintive wails of the infant increased instead of diminished,\\nthe elder woman got up and made her way up the aisle.\\n\\nRoyal Ainsley started violently as he felt the heavy hand on his\\nshoulder.\\n\\n\"Why don\\'t you feed your baby, sir?\" she said, brusquely.\\n\\nHe looked at her angrily, his brows bent together in a decided frown.\\n\\n\"What do you mean by interrupting my thoughts, woman?\" he cried,\\nharshly.\\n\\nHis angry retort roused all the antagonism in the woman\\'s nature.\\n\\n\"I mean just what I say--your baby\\'s hungry, mister,\" she replied. \"If\\nyou had the feelings of a loving father, you\\'d know enough to feed it.\"\\n\\nHe looked at her in consternation.\\n\\n\"Feed it?\" he echoed, blankly. \"I--I was not prepared for anything like\\nthis. Such a thing did not occur to me.\"\\n\\n\"And you didn\\'t bring a nursing-bottle along with you?\" echoed the\\nwoman.\\n\\n\"No,\" he responded, curtly, but also somewhat blankly.\\n\\n\"Good Lord! that\\'s just like a man, to forget important things like\\nthat.\"\\n\\n\"What am I to do?\" he asked, appealingly. \"What would you suggest,\\nmadame. I am at sea.\"\\n\\nShe looked at him perplexedly; then her motherly face brightened as she\\nglanced about the car.\\n\\n\"I will soon see what can be done,\" she answered, making her way as\\nquickly as the moving train would allow to the end of the car, where\\ntwo women sat with tiny infants on their laps.\\n\\nVery soon she returned with the article she had gone in search of.\\n\\n\"Let me take the poor little thing,\" she said, \"and feed it. Men, and\\nmore especially young men, don\\'t know anything about such things.\"\\n\\nRoyal Ainsley gladly delivered his charge into her keeping. Very soon\\nthe woman had stilled its cries, and it was sleeping peacefully in her\\narms. An idea then came to Royal Ainsley. His pale-blue eyes glittered\\nwith a fiendish light.\\n\\nHe almost laughed aloud at the thought that flashed through his mind.\\n\\n\"Do you think the baby will sleep a little while?\" he asked, drawing\\nhis hat down over his face.\\n\\n\"It is likely to,\" she answered; \"still, one can not always tell.\\nSamantha, my daughter here, never slept ten minutes on a stretch when\\nshe was a baby. She was a lot of trouble to me then; but I don\\'t mind\\nit now, for she\\'s a heap of comfort to me, sir. I wouldn\\'t know how to\\nget along without Samantha. She----\"\\n\\nRoyal Ainsley interrupted her impatiently.\\n\\n\"I was going to say that if you would be kind enough to hold the little\\none for awhile I would like to go into the smoking-car and smoke a\\ncigar.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLV.\\n\\n\\nRoyal Ainsley thought the woman did not hear his question, for she did\\nnot answer, and he repeated, in his suave, winning way:\\n\\n\"Could I trouble you to hold the little one a few moments, while I\\nenjoy a smoke in the car ahead?\"\\n\\nWidow Jones answered readily enough:\\n\\n\"To be sure I will take care of the little one, sir. Go right along and\\nenjoy your cigar. I know just how a man feels when he is deprived of a\\nsmoke. My husband had to have his pipe every night after his supper,\\njust as sure as the sun went down. If he missed it, he was fairly\\nbeside himself--like a fish out of water.\"\\n\\nIt suddenly occurred to Royal Ainsley that it wouldn\\'t be a bad idea to\\nknow more about this woman.\\n\\n\"Do you live near here?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"Just three stations above--near Larchmont village. We won\\'t reach\\nthere for nearly three-quarters of an hour, so that need not trouble\\nyou, sir. I take it that you are a widower, sir,\" she went on, before\\nhe could rise from his seat.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he answered, shortly, and with considerable impatience.\\n\\n\"It\\'s too bad!\" chimed in Samantha--\"and to be left with such a young\\nbaby, too. It\\'s too bad that you didn\\'t get a nurse for her, unless you\\nare taking her to some of your folks.\"\\n\\n\"I have no relatives,\" he answered. \"I am going to New York for the\\nexpress purpose of finding some one to take care of the child.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed!\" exclaimed Widow Jones. \"How strange that you should\\ncome across me! Why, do you know, I used to take little ones in\\noccasionally, and keep them for their fathers until they were old\\nenough to get about. Before you look further, sir--although I don\\'t\\nlike to recommend myself--I\\'d like to have you stop off at Larchmont\\nand inquire all about me. There isn\\'t a man, woman, or child for miles\\naround but can tell you about me.\"\\n\\n\"Why, it is indeed a piece of good luck that I should have come across\\nyou, madame!\" declared Royal Ainsley. \"We may be able to come to terms\\nhere and now.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t ask too much, ma,\" whispered Samantha, under her breath.\\n\\n\"You can set your own price,\" said Royal Ainsley, in an off-hand manner.\\n\\n\"Oh, I will leave that entirely to you, sir,\" said the widow. \"I\\'ll\\ntake the baby and care for her, and you can come and see her whenever\\nyou like. I\\'ll leave the pay entirely to you. That\\'s fair enough, sir,\\nisn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\"You are entirely too magnanimous,\" he declared. \"By the way, here\\'s a\\nten-dollar note to start with. That\\'s the only bill I have, save those\\nof very large denomination. In the course of a few weeks I will make\\npermanent arrangements with you.\"\\n\\n\"But surely you are going to stop off at Larchmont, sir, and see where\\nI live. I don\\'t expect that you will trust a dear little baby like this\\nto a stranger. You will most likely want a recommendation.\"\\n\\n\"Your face is certainly recommendation enough, my good woman,\" he\\ndeclared. \"Nevertheless, I shall, of course, stop off with you.\"\\n\\nHe rose with a bow.\\n\\n\"Remember, sir,\" chimed in Samantha, \"that part of the train switches\\noff just a few miles below there. If you don\\'t look out, you\\'ll be\\ntaken on to New York.\"\\n\\n\"I must look out for that,\" he said. \"I had certainly intended to take\\na little nap after my smoke. I haven\\'t closed my eyes for two nights;\\nthe baby was not feeling well. Your warning will put me on my guard, at\\nall events.\"\\n\\nAgain he bowed, and in an instant he had disappeared.\\n\\n\"I wonder what his name is,\" said Samantha. \"You forgot to ask him, ma.\"\\n\\n\"So I did, to be sure. But it\\'s easy finding that out.\"\\n\\nFurther conversation was stopped by the sudden waking up of the pretty\\ndark-eyed babe; but a little milk from the bottle and a few soothing\\nwords soon succeeded in quieting her.\\n\\n\"We are almost at the switch,\" said Samantha. \"Ought not somebody go\\ninto the smoking-car and inform the gentleman of it?\"\\n\\n\"Why, certainly not. It\\'s likely he knows of it. He was told of it,\\nand it\\'s likely some one will inform him. You had better look after\\nyour boxes and bundles. Be sure to pick up the bag of candy, the\\nginger-snaps, the bunch of bachelor buttons, the rosemary, my shawl,\\nand your new pair of shoes.\"\\n\\n\"If I have to hold this baby and pick up my dress, it will be as much\\nas I can do. But I\\'m quite sure the gentleman will come and take care\\nof the baby himself,\" added Samantha, wistfully.\\n\\nThe conductor called out the station. It was the busiest junction in\\nthe northern part of Virginia. Two trains met and passed each other\\nhere, while still another was side-tracked, waiting for the right of\\nway. There was always a rush of people at the station, and consequently\\nconfusion and noise. Widow Jones and Samantha stepped from the car to\\nthe platform.\\n\\n\"We ought to have waited,\" declared the girl. \"See, we have missed him,\\nas I told you we would. I had better run back and see if he\\'s there.\\nHe\\'s probably going on to New York. But he will be sure to see us, no\\nmatter what car he is in.\"\\n\\nA moment more, and the two trains moved on. Even Widow Jones was now\\nthoroughly alarmed. What her daughter had feared had taken place. The\\nyoung man had certainly missed them.\\n\\n\"Overcome with fatigue, he probably fell asleep in the smoking-car, in\\nspite of himself,\" said Samantha.\\n\\n\"Well, anyhow he knows your name and address, mother. He will be sure\\nto telegraph back to us at Larchmont.\"\\n\\nStill, Widow Jones, who held the baby close in her arms, looked\\ntroubled.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLVI.\\n\\n\\n\"He has certainly been carried on to New York,\" said Widow Jones.\\n\"There is nothing left but to get home and await results.\"\\n\\n\"I guess you\\'re about right,\" said Samantha.\\n\\nThey left word at the railroad station to at once bring up any telegram\\nthat might come for them.\\n\\nAn hour after they arrived at Larchmont, every one had heard of Mrs.\\nJones and the baby, and her experience with the handsome stranger.\\n\\nWhen a fortnight passed, and the weeks lengthened into months, Mrs.\\nJones began to be a little skeptical.\\n\\n\"We will keep the baby until he _does_ come for it, Samantha,\" she said.\\n\\nSomehow the little waif with the great dark eyes and the little\\nrose-bud mouth had crept into their hearts, and they could not turn it\\naway.\\n\\nSamantha did her share in looking after the baby; but it was a little\\nhard, for she had a great deal to do waiting upon customers in the\\nvillage bakery.\\n\\nThe mother and daughter made no further mention of the handsome\\nstranger.\\n\\n\"If we had but asked him his name. I wanted you to, ma,\" declared\\nSamantha. \"But there\\'s no use in crying now. We have the satisfaction\\nof having a baby, anyhow,\" declared the girl, spiritedly.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" assented her mother, dubiously; \"but it\\'s quite a task to bring\\nup other people\\'s children.\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, freed from the care of the child, Royal Ainsley walked\\nthrough the train. It was just approaching the station, when, all\\nunobserved, he swung from the back platform just as the express was\\nmoving out again.\\n\\nA chuckle of delight broke from his lips.\\n\\n\"That was most cleverly managed. My compliments to Mrs. Jones, of\\nLarchmont. She has been exceedingly useful to me.\"\\n\\nHe did not trouble himself as to what disposition they might make of\\nthe child.\\n\\nThe question that occurred to him was--\"how am I to destroy the proofs\\nI have concerning the child?\"\\n\\nBut no answer came to him regarding this dilemma. He thrust them back\\ninto his pocket. He would have plenty of time to plan when he reached\\nNew York.\\n\\nSuddenly the thought came to him, that he would be foolish to turn back\\nfrom the course he had marked out for himself. Instead of returning, he\\nwould go back and see Eugene.\\n\\nThere was a friend of his living in the vicinity. He would find him,\\nand pass a week or two with him, then he would carry out his original\\nscheme. He acted upon this thought.\\n\\nIt was the fishing season, and Royal Ainsley made a valuable addition\\nto a party of young men already gathered at his friend\\'s quarters. Five\\nweeks elapsed before the party broke up.\\n\\n\"By this time Eugene\\'s wife must have recovered from her illness,\" he\\nsaid, grimly. \"If I don\\'t go and see him now, they will probably be\\ngetting ready to go off somewhere, and I will miss them.\"\\n\\nSuiting the action to the word, Royal Ainsley took the train the next\\nday and arrived at his native village at dusk.\\n\\nHe had taken the precaution to provide himself with a long top-coat and\\na slouch hat.\\n\\nHe avoided the depot and its waiting-room, lest he should meet some one\\nwho might recognize him.\\n\\nHe struck into a side-path, and a sharp walk of some fifteen minutes\\nbrought him in sight of the old mansion.\\n\\nHow dark and gloomy the night was! There was no moon, and not a star\\nshone in the heavens.\\n\\nA short cut across the fields brought him to a little brook. He looked\\ndown upon it in silence as it gurgled on sullenly over its rocky bed.\\n\\nHe looked back at the grand old mansion looming up in the distance. And\\nas he looked, he clinched his hands, and the bitterness in his heart\\nbecame more intense.\\n\\n\"But for Eugene, all that would be mine,\" he muttered. \"He stepped\\nbetween me and the fortune. When we were boys together, I realized that\\nhe would do it, and I hated him--hated him for his suave, winning ways\\nand the love which every one showered on him. He was always lucky.\"\\n\\nHe turned and looked again at the great stone mansion, whose turrets\\nwere dimly outlined against the sky. And as he looked he saw a door on\\nthe rear porch open and a figure clad in a white, fleecy dress glide\\nout upon the porch and walk slowly into the grounds.\\n\\n\"That is probably the bride,\" he muttered, with a harsh little laugh.\\n\\nTo his surprise, she crossed the lawn and made directly for the spot\\nwhere he stood.\\n\\n\"I shall not be likely to get a good look at her unless the moon comes\\nout,\" he thought.\\n\\nHe drew back into the shadow of the alders that skirted the brook. His\\nbitter, vengeful thoughts were turned aside for a moment while watching\\nthe advancing figure.\\n\\n\"Why should my cousin have wealth, love, happiness, while I have to\\nknock about here and there, getting my living as best I can, being\\nalways in hard luck and a mark for the arrows of relentless fate?\" he\\nsoliloquized.\\n\\nNearer and nearer drew the slender, graceful figure.\\n\\nRoyal Ainsley was right. It was his cousin\\'s wife.\\n\\nShe went on slowly over the greensward in the sweet night air, little\\ndreaming what lay at the end of her path.\\n\\nBy the merest chance the hapless young wife had come across the letter\\nthat Miss Fernly had written to Eugene Mallard. It had fallen from his\\npocket when he was looking over some papers on the porch one day.\\n\\nPassing by soon after, Ida saw the paper lying there, picked it up, and\\nopened it. There, while the sun shone and the birds sung, she read it\\nthrough, and the wonder was that she did not die then and there.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLVII.\\n\\n\\nFrom the moment that Ida had learned through Miss Fernly\\'s letter how\\nHildegarde Cramer had mourned for her lover, the young wife\\'s life had\\nbecome very unhappy.\\n\\nShe knew well that she stood between Hildegarde Cramer and her\\nhappiness. She had done her best to die, but Heaven had not so willed\\nit.\\n\\nThe pity of it was that her love for Eugene Mallard had increased a\\nhundred fold. It was driving her to madness.\\n\\n\"Oh, if it were all ended!\" she cried aloud. \"Better anything than this\\nawful despair!\"\\n\\nNo one heard her. There was no one near to hear what she moaned out to\\nthe brook that kept so many secrets.\\n\\nShe heard a crash in the branches near by--a slight crash, but she\\nstarted. It was only a bird that had fallen from its nest in the tree\\noverhead, she told herself.\\n\\nBut even after she had said it she felt a sense of uncontrollable\\nterror that she could not account for; felt the weight of some strange\\npresence.\\n\\nThat voice!\\n\\nWhen Ida cried aloud in her despair, the words fell like an electric\\nshock upon the ears of a man who listened behind the alder branches.\\n\\n\"By all that is wonderful!\" he cried, under his breath. \"Either my ears\\nhave deceived me, or that is the voice of Ida May! Well, well! Will\\nsurprises never cease?\"\\n\\nHe stepped quickly forward, and the next moment he was by her side. How\\nstrange it was that at that instant the moon came out from behind a\\ncloud and rendered every object as bright as if in the noonday sun.\\n\\nAt the sound of the step, Ida started back in affright.\\n\\nOne glance into the face looking down into her own and she started back\\nwith a cry that was scarcely human.\\n\\n\"You!\" she gasped.\\n\\nThen her lips grew cold and stiff. She could not utter another word.\\n\\n\"The surprise is mutual!\" he answered. \"What in the name of all that is\\nwonderful are you doing in this house? Come, my dear, let us sit down\\non this log while you explain matters.\"\\n\\nIda drew back in loathing.\\n\\n\"Stand back!\" she cried. \"Do not attempt to touch me, or I shall cry\\nout for help!\"\\n\\nA fierce imprecation broke from the man\\'s lips.\\n\\n\"What do you mean by all this high and mighty nonsense?\" he cried.\\n\"Speak at once. You are my wife! Why shouldn\\'t I lay hands on you?\"\\n\\n\"No!\" she cried. \"Though you have so cruelly deceived me, I thank God\\nthat I am not your wife.\"\\n\\nHe threw back his fair, handsome head, and a laugh that was not\\npleasant to hear fell from his lips.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t make any mistake about that!\" he cried. \"I remember what I\\nwrote you--that there was some illegality in the ceremony which made\\nour marriage invalid. But I learned afterward, when I met the chap\\nwho performed the ceremony, that it was entirely legal. If you doubt\\nthat what I say is true, I can easily convince you of the truth of my\\nassertion.\"\\n\\nIda drew back with a cry so awful that he looked at her.\\n\\n\"Well, well, who can understand the ways of women?\" he remarked,\\nironically. \"I thought that you would rejoice over the fact that our\\nmarriage was legal, but I find that you are sorry.\"\\n\\nStill she was looking at him with wide-open eyes.\\n\\n\"I can not, I will not believe anything so horrible!\" she gasped. \"It\\nwould drive me mad!\"\\n\\n\"I assure you it is true,\" he declared. \"Like yourself, I believed that\\nthe marriage was not binding. But I found it was, and that saved me\\nfrom wedding another girl.\"\\n\\nA cry that seemed to rend her heart in twain broke from her white lips.\\n\\n\"But tell me, what are you doing here?\" he asked, wonderingly.\\n\\nThen it was that something like an inkling of the truth came to him.\\n\\n\"Great God!\" he cried, \"it can not be possible that you are in any\\nway connected with my cousin--that you are the bride he brought home?\\nSpeak! Why are you trembling so? Has my guess come anywhere near the\\nmark?\"\\n\\nIda looked up at him with wild, frightened eyes like those of a hunted\\ndeer.\\n\\n\"Speak!\" he cried again, fiercely grasping her arm, \"or I will wring\\nthe truth from you!\"\\n\\n\"I--I am Eugene Mallard\\'s wife,\" she whispered in a voice that would\\nhave touched any other man\\'s heart than the one who was bending over\\nher with rage depicted on his face.\\n\\nHe laughed aloud, and that laugh was horrible to hear.\\n\\nShe did not spare herself. She told him all the bitter truth--how,\\nbeing thrown in contact with Eugene Mallard day after day, she had\\nlearned to love him with all the strength of her nature; how, seeing\\nhow good, kind and true he was--a king among men--she fell face\\ndownward in the dew-wet grass and cried out to Heaven that her life\\nwould cease the moment she went out of Eugene Mallard\\'s life.\\n\\n\"This is, indeed, a fine state of affairs!\" he cried out.\\n\\n\"What would you have me do?\" cried the unhappy young girl in the voice\\nof one dying.\\n\\nHe did not answer her at once; but, taking a cigar from his pocket, he\\ncoolly lighted it.\\n\\n\"When you are through with your hysterics, we will talk the matter\\nover,\" he assented, frowningly.\\n\\nShe struggled to her feet.\\n\\n\"Sit down!\" he commanded, pointing to the trunk of a tree.\\n\\nFeeling more dead than alive, she sat down in the place which he had\\nindicated. She expected that her life would end at any moment, the\\ntension on her nerves was so great.\\n\\nHe did not speak; but the short, harsh laugh that broke from his lips,\\nas he puffed away at his cigar, was more cruel than the harshest words.\\n\\n\"This is what one might call a melodrama in real life,\" he said, at\\nlength. \"It savors of comedy, too, and illustrates fully the old\\nsaying: \\'Truth is often stranger than fiction!\\' But, to get down to\\nbusiness. Turn around and face me, while I tell you the injunction I\\nlay upon you, and which you dare not refuse to obey!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\\n\\n\\nThe hapless young wife looked into the hard, set face above her, her\\neyes dilating with fear.\\n\\nHer brain reeled; it seemed to her that she was dying.\\n\\n\"Listen to what I have to say,\" exclaimed Royal Ainsley, his hand\\ntightening on her shoulder. \"You have a fine home here--much finer\\nthan I could possibly offer you--and I propose that you shall keep\\nit. There is no use in wasting sentiment between us. We do not care\\nfor each other, and you _do_ care for Eugene Mallard. It will be some\\nsatisfaction for you to live beneath this roof, and I won\\'t mind it\\nat all, providing you make it worth my while. I will make my meaning\\nclearer to you. I must have some money, and you are the one who must\\nhelp me to it. Get a thousand dollars, and I will go away and never\\nagain molest you. Come, now, what do you say?\"\\n\\nIda drew back and looked at him.\\n\\n\"You know that I could not get it for you,\" she said, with calmness.\\n\\n\"You know the alternative,\" he said, harshly.\\n\\n\"No matter what the alternative is, I--I could not help you,\" she\\nanswered, huskily.\\n\\n\"If you refuse,\" he went on, \"I can have Eugene Mallard and yourself\\narrested for bigamy. I can send you both to prison, and, so help me\\nHeaven, I\\'ll do it! You say that you love Eugene Mallard. We will see\\nif you love him well enough to save him.\"\\n\\n\"You monster!\" she gasped, wildly, \"you would not do such a thing, I\\nsay. You dare not outrage Heaven like that.\"\\n\\n\"The shoe is on the other foot. It is _you_ who have outraged Heaven\\nin violating the law. I must have that money, and you know I am a\\ndesperate man.\"\\n\\nHe would not tell her just now that her child was alive. He would save\\nthat piece of news for some other time.\\n\\nBefore she could reply, they saw some of the servants crossing the lawn.\\n\\n\"I must go!\" she cried, wrenching herself free from his grasp. \"They\\nhave come in search of me!\"\\n\\n\"I shall be here to-morrow night at this very spot awaiting your\\nanswer,\" he said, harshly.\\n\\nWhy had Heaven let Royal Ainsley find her? Had he not already brought\\nmisery enough into her life?\\n\\nShe turned the matter over in her mind. Every word he had said, every\\nthreat he had made, occurred to her.\\n\\nWould he make good his threat, and take vengeance upon the man she\\nloved if she refused to raise one thousand dollars for him?\\n\\nShe knew he was what he had said--a desperate man.\\n\\nOh, if she had but dared creep into the library, throw herself at\\nEugene Mallard\\'s feet, and tell him all, what woe would have been\\nspared her. But, alas! she dared not.\\n\\nHeaven help her! How could she leave Eugene Mallard, whom she loved\\nbetter than life.\\n\\nShe crept up to her room, and during the long hours of the night she\\nfought the fiercest battle that woman ever fought with herself. If she\\ngave Royal Ainsley the money he had asked for, he would certainly go\\naway and never cross her path again.\\n\\nHer heart leaped at the thought. The thought that she was still bound\\nto Royal Ainsley brought with it the most poignant grief--a feeling of\\nhorror.\\n\\nShe did realize what it meant to live there beneath that roof, even\\nafter she had found out the truth--that she was not Eugene Mallard\\'s\\nwife.\\n\\nWhat harm was there in living in the home of the man she loved, seeing\\nthat they were so far apart in heart as well as in purpose?\\n\\n\"No, I can not tear myself away from the only one I have ever loved!\"\\nshe cried. \"If I were living here with Eugene Mallard as his wife, then\\nmy duty would be plain--I would have to leave here at once.\"\\n\\nNo, no! Come what might, she could not tear herself away from Eugene\\nMallard.\\n\\nIn the drawer of her writing-desk lay a roll of bills which Eugene had\\nhanded her the day before, to purchase new furniture for her suite of\\nrooms.\\n\\n\"Select it the first day you go to the city,\" he had said.\\n\\nShe had intended purchasing it the following week.\\n\\nNow she went hurriedly to her desk, took out the roll of bills, and\\ncounted them.\\n\\nThere was just a thousand dollars. She drew a great sigh of relief.\\nThat would buy Royal Ainsley\\'s eternal silence. Before handing it to\\nhim, she would swear him to secrecy forever.\\n\\nShe never knew how she lived through the next day.\\n\\nThere was not a moment that Royal Ainsley\\'s handsome, cruel, sneering\\nface did not appear before her.\\n\\nHow she loathed him! She hated, with fierce, intense hatred, the very\\nsound of his name.\\n\\nNight came at last.\\n\\nThe few guests that were stopping at the house were assembled in the\\ndrawing-room, and it was not an easy matter to find some convenient\\nexcuse to get away from them.\\n\\nBut when the hands of the clock on the mantel pointed to the hour of\\neight, she felt that she must get away.\\n\\nSome one suggested playing a piece of music which she had taken to her\\nroom the day before to study.\\n\\n\"I will go and search for it,\" she said; and with that remark she\\nglided from the room.\\n\\nHow dark the night was! She almost shivered as she touched the graveled\\nwalk and hurried down to the brook-side.\\n\\nWhen this night had passed away, a life-time of happiness would lay\\nbefore her. The wind moaned fitfully among the trees, and the branches\\nof the tall oaks swayed to and fro. She heard the murmur of the brook\\nbefore she reached it, and as she drew near and became accustomed to\\nthe dim light, she saw a tall man pacing up and down.\\n\\nHe did not hear the light step on the grass. He was muttering\\nimprecations that made the girl\\'s heart turn cold with dread as she\\nlistened. Then he saw her.\\n\\n\"Ah! you have come!\" he eagerly called out. \"It is well for you that\\nyou did,\" he continued, \"for I had just made up my mind to go to the\\nhouse and ask for you.\"\\n\\nIn the dim light he saw her recoil. Although she made no answer, he\\nfancied he could almost hear the wild throbbing of her heart.\\n\\n\"Did you bring the money?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" she answered hoarsely; \"but before I give it to you, I shall\\nexact a solemn promise that you will never come near me again!\"\\n\\n\"Certainly you shall have the promise--a dozen of them if you like,\"\\nhe cried, forcing back an insolent laugh.\\n\\n\"You must solemnly promise that you will never come near me again if I\\ngive this money to you,\" she said.\\n\\n\"No,\" he answered; \"I will never come near you. I will go abroad. Does\\nthat satisfy you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" she answered. \"Only go so far away that I shall never see your\\nface again.\"\\n\\nHe closed his hand eagerly over the money, saying to himself that it\\nwas a veritable gold mine that he had found.\\n\\n\"Let me go!\" she panted, as he put out his hand to touch her.\\n\\nWith the swiftness of a startled deer, she fled past him into the\\ndarkness of the grounds.\\n\\nRoyal Ainsley laughed harshly.\\n\\n\"This money will last me for a few weeks, my lady,\" he muttered, \"and\\nthen--Ah! we shall see!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLIX.\\n\\n\\nWhen Ida re-entered the house, the guests were still assembled in the\\ndrawing-room.\\n\\nEugene Mallard was standing a little apart from the rest, looking\\nthoughtfully into vacancy.\\n\\nAs she entered the room, he started, and, to her surprise, he crossed\\nover to her.\\n\\n\"Ida,\" he said, \"will you come out on the porch with me for a few\\nmoments? I wish to speak with you.\"\\n\\nShe looked at him in terror. Had he learned of the return of Royal\\nAinsley?\\n\\nA great darkness seemed to suddenly envelop her, and it was by the\\ngreatest effort that she kept herself from swooning. But the fresh air\\nrevived her.\\n\\nEugene placed a chair for her, and as she was trembling violently,\\nshe was glad to sink into it. There was a seat near. Eugene did not\\ntake it, but, instead, stood leaning against one of the fluted columns\\nof the porch. For a few moments he was silent, and those few moments\\nseemed like long years to Ida.\\n\\n\"I have brought you out here to have an earnest talk with you,\" he\\nsaid, huskily. \"The time has now come when we should try to understand\\neach other. Don\\'t you think so?\"\\n\\nShe looked up at him in affright. Was he going to send her away? Was he\\ngrowing tired of the position in which they stood to each other?\\n\\n\"Yes,\" she answered; and it caused her a desperate effort to utter the\\nword.\\n\\n\"I am going to take you into my confidence, Ida,\" he said. \"Come under\\nthis swinging lamp. I want to read you this letter.\"\\n\\nShe followed him with faltering steps.\\n\\nTo her great surprise she saw him take from his breast-pocket the very\\nletter which Miss Fernly had sent, and which she had slipped into\\nhis desk. But she dared not tell him that she knew what the letter\\ncontained.\\n\\n\"I will preface my remarks by saying that the news of your illness has\\nspread far and wide, and that the report was repeated in different\\nforms. Instead of saying that you were ill, some of the papers had it\\nthat my young wife had died. Miss Fernly, whom you have good reason to\\nremember, thereupon wrote me this letter.\"\\n\\nShe listened, her face white as death. He handed her the letter. Every\\nword made a new wound in her heart. How well she remembered each and\\nevery sentence! Slowly she read the letter through. Then she folded and\\nhanded it back to him.\\n\\n\"Ida,\" he said, \"I have been trying to forget the past as no man has\\never tried before. All my time has been given up to it. I have drawn\\na curtain over my past, and shut out its brightness, its hopes, from\\nmy life. I have pulled the roots of a beautiful budding plant from my\\nsoul, and bid it grow there no more. I have tried to do my duty by you,\\nand now I have come to this conclusion--you must help me bury the past.\\nI have brought you out here to ask you to be my wife in fact as well as\\nin name.\"\\n\\nHe did not tell her that during her illness he had discovered the\\nsecret of her life--that she loved him with all the passionate love of\\nher nature, and that his indifference was eating out her life.\\n\\nEver since he had been turning the matter over in his mind, and asking\\nhimself what he should do, and at last he was brought face to face with\\nthe truth--he had no right to marry her unless he intended living with\\nher.\\n\\nSo clearly had his duty become defined to him that the path of\\nthe future was now plain before him. He must forget his love for\\nHildegarde, and the only way to do that was to ask the wife he had\\nwedded to help him.\\n\\n\"I ask you this after much calm deliberation,\" he said, slowly. \"Be\\nmy wife in reality as well as in name, and we may yet make good and\\nuseful lives out of what is left of them!\"\\n\\nHe heard a cry escape from her lips, but he could not tell whether it\\nwas one of pleasure or pain.\\n\\n\"I do not ask you to give my answer at once, unless you choose to do\\nso,\" he said, gently.\\n\\nHe bent over her and took her hand. He was startled at its icy\\ncoldness. He could feel that she trembled at his touch.\\n\\n\"I have startled you,\" he said, gently. \"I would advise you to go to\\nyour room, instead of mingling with the guests to-night. There you can\\nreflect upon what you wish to do. I will leave you here,\" he said. But\\nbefore he turned away, he involuntarily stooped down, and kissed the\\nwhite face raised so appealingly to his.\\n\\nIt was the first caress he had ever offered her, and that kiss burned\\nher face for long hours afterward. It filled her to the very depth of\\nher soul, to the very center of her heart.\\n\\nLike one stricken suddenly blind, Ida groped her way to her room.\\n\\n\"Ah! if I could only die with the memory of that kiss burning my lips!\"\\nshe cried.\\n\\nShe was like one stunned. What she had longed for, yearned for with all\\nthe intensity of her soul, was laid at her feet at last. But it was too\\nlate.\\n\\nHis love was offered her now, when she dared not claim it, dared not\\naccept it.\\n\\nIda rose the next morning with a heavy heart. She had slept the sleep\\nof exhaustion.\\n\\nEugene was surprised when she came down to the table, she looked so\\nchanged. There were heavy circles under her eyes, as though she had\\nbeen weeping.\\n\\nHe could not understand her. He was quite sure she would meet him with\\na happy, blushing face and downcast eyes. Ida would be glad when she\\ncould escape his wondering eyes. An hour later she was standing at the\\nwindow of the morning-room, which opened out on the terrace, her mind\\nin a tumult, when she heard Eugene\\'s voice at the other end of the\\nroom. She knew instinctively that he was looking for her. Only two days\\nago she would have waited there for him--would have eagerly sought the\\nopportunity of a few words with him; but now she hastily unfastened the\\nlong French window, and fled out into the grounds.\\n\\nEugene saw the flutter of the white figure hurrying down the terrace.\\n\\n\"She wishes to escape an encounter with me,\" he thought; and he was\\npuzzled.\\n\\nIda went to the further end of the garden, where the tall rose-bushes\\nhid her from human eyes. She sat down upon a little rustic bench and\\ntried to think. But her brain grew confused.\\n\\nOnly a short time ago she had cried out to Heaven to give her the love\\nof Eugene Mallard. Now that it was laid at her feet, what should she do?\\n\\n\"Heaven direct me,\" she cried out; \"I am so sorely tempted! I used to\\nwonder what people meant when they talked of the agony of death. Now I\\nknow.\"\\n\\nShe was frightened at the vehemence of her emotion; the memory of that\\ncaress made her tremble. She dreaded the moment when she should see\\nEugene alone again, but, woman-like, hoped that it would be soon. Her\\nheart was awakened at last. The sun of love shone in its glory upon her.\\n\\nIt had come to her, this woman\\'s heritage, this dower of passion and\\nsorrow, called love, changing the world into a golden gleam.\\n\\nHow was she ever to calm the fever that burned in her veins? Yes, she\\nloved him. She who had never, until she met Eugene Mallard, known what\\nlove meant; she, so young, beautiful, made so essentially for love, and\\nyet whose life had been so joyless and hopeless, loved at last.\\n\\nEugene Mallard noticed her avoidance of him during the week that\\nfollowed. She was trying to think out the problem in her own mind. Dare\\nshe drink of the cup of joy that he had pressed to her lips? In her\\nsimplicity, Ida thought that she had done much in denying herself a\\nlook at him.\\n\\nIf she had been the most accomplished of coquettes, she could not\\nhave chosen a method more calculating to awaken his interest than by\\navoiding him.\\n\\n\"She does not care for me as much as I thought,\" he told himself; and,\\nman-like, he felt a trifle piqued.\\n\\nHe had fancied that all he would have to do would be to ask her, and\\nshe would come straight to his arms.\\n\\nThis was, indeed, a new phase of her character. Yet he could not help\\nbut admire her maidenly modesty.\\n\\nHe would give her her own time to think over the proposition that he\\nhad laid before her. He would not seek her, would not intrude upon her.\\nHe looked at her more during that day than he had during all the time\\nshe had been under his roof.\\n\\nHe had not known before that she was so beautiful, so sweet, so\\nwomanly. How careless he had been in letting her go about by herself, a\\nprey for such rascals as Arthur Hollis!\\n\\nOnce he surprised her in the grounds. He had come up to her very\\nquietly.\\n\\n\"Ida,\" he said, \"have you forgotten that you have not so far answered\\nthe question I asked of you two weeks ago on the porch? Tell me, when\\nam I to claim my wife?\"\\n\\nHis wife! Great Heaven! Had she been mad, dreaming? What had she been\\ndoing? What had she done?\\n\\nHis wife! She was Royal Ainsley\\'s wife, and she could not belong to any\\nother man. She looked at him with the pallor of despair in her face,\\nthe shadow of death in her eyes.\\n\\nWhat had she been doing to think of love in connection with Eugene\\nMallard, when she was bound by the heaviest of chains? The shock was\\nterrible to her in those few minutes, and the wonder is that it did not\\nkill her.\\n\\n\"I must have your answer here and now,\" Eugene said, a trifle\\nimpatiently.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER L.\\n\\n\\nEugene Mallard, looking down at the lovely, terrified face, wondered\\nwhat there could be to frighten her so.\\n\\nHe was intending to do a kind action. That she should take the matter\\nin this fashion rather surprised him. He told himself that he could not\\nunderstand women and their ways.\\n\\n\"My reason for coming to this conclusion,\" he said, \"is that I am\\nintending to take a trip through the country, and desire that you shall\\naccompany me, Ida. We could not go as we are now, and lead the same\\nlife as we are living under this roof,\" he added, as she did not appear\\nto understand him. \"You understand what I mean?\" he asked.\\n\\nShe answered \"Yes,\" though he doubted very much if she really did\\ncomprehend his words.\\n\\n\"That will be a fortnight from now. It will give you plenty of time to\\nthink the matter over.\"\\n\\nWith these words he turned and left her.\\n\\nShe sank down into a garden-seat near by, her heart in a tumult. The\\nsheltered spot in which she sat was free from observation. The tall,\\nflowering branches screened her.\\n\\nDuring the days that followed, Eugene Mallard watched Ida sharply. If\\nthe girl loved him as well as she said she did, how strange it was that\\nshe was unwilling to come to him.\\n\\nOne day, while they were at the breakfast-table, the servant brought in\\nthe morning\\'s mail.\\n\\n\"Here is a letter for you, Ida,\" said Eugene, handing her a square\\nwhite envelope.\\n\\nOne glance at it, and her soul seemed to turn sick within her. It was\\nfrom Royal Ainsley!\\n\\nWhat had he to say to her? When he left her he promised that she should\\nnever see his face again, that he would never cross her path.\\n\\nWhat did this communication mean?\\n\\nBreakfast was over at last, and she hastened to the morning-room, where\\nshe could read her letter without being observed.\\n\\n \"MY LITTLE WIFE.--I am running in hard luck after all. I invested all\\n the money you were so generous as to give me, and lost every cent\\n of it. An open confession is good for the soul. Having told you the\\n truth, I feel better. I will need just the same amount of money to\\n float me, and you must raise it for me somehow. I use the word _must_\\n to duly impress it upon you. I will be at the same place where I met\\n you last, on the evening of the fourteenth. That will be just ten days\\n from the time you receive this letter. Do not fail me, Ida, or I might\\n be tempted to wreak vengeance upon my amiable cousin, fascinating\\n Eugene.\\n\\n     \"Yours in haste, and with much love,\\n\\n     \"ROYAL.\"\\n\\nShe flung the letter from her as though it were a scorpion. A look of\\nterror came over her face, her head throbbed, and her brain whirled.\\nOh, Heaven! the torture of it!\\n\\nWhat if he kept this up? It would not be long before she would be\\ndriven to madness.\\n\\n\"My little wife!\" How the words galled her; they almost seemed to take\\nher life away.\\n\\n\"He will torture me to madness,\" she thought, with the agony of despair.\\n\\nHow was she to raise the money to appease the man who was her\\nrelentless foe?\\n\\nThen she thought of her diamonds. Among the gifts which she had\\nreceived from Eugene was a diamond necklace. This he had inherited from\\nhis uncle.\\n\\n\"The setting is very old,\" he had said, \"because the necklace has been\\nworn by the ladies of our family for generations. The stones, however,\\nare remarkably white and brilliant. They are among the finest in this\\ncountry, and worth a fortune in themselves.\"\\n\\nShe had often looked at them as they lay in their rich purple-velvet\\ncase.\\n\\n\"I--I could raise the money on them,\" she thought, with a little sob.\\n\\nBut she did not know it was to end in a tragedy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LI.\\n\\n\\nIda no sooner found herself alone than she took from her wardrobe a\\nblack dress, a long cloak, a bonnet and black veil. She quickly donned\\nthem, then stole into the corridor, locking the door after her, and\\nputting the key in her pocket.\\n\\nIf she could get out of the house and into the grounds unobserved, all\\nwould be well. Fortune favored her; no one was in sight.\\n\\nShe made her way to the railway station, and bought a ticket for\\nWashington. On the train was quite a number of people whom she had met\\nbefore. But they did not recognize her with the veil pulled so closely\\nover her face.\\n\\nThe world seemed to stand still; but her heart seemed to beat wildly,\\nas she thought of it all.\\n\\nAt last Washington was reached, and for a minute she stood irresolute\\nas she stepped upon the platform of the depot. Then she timidly crossed\\nover to where a policeman stood.\\n\\n\"I--I would like to be directed to a pawn-broker\\'s store, if--if you\\nknow where there is one,\" she said.\\n\\nThe guardian of the peace looked at her suspiciously.\\n\\nIt was a part of his business to believe all strangers dishonest until\\nhe found them otherwise.\\n\\n\"Are you so much in need of money as to have to resort to that?\" he\\nasked, taking in the stylish make and fine texture of the clothes she\\nwore.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" she answered, timidly.\\n\\nThe policeman pointed to a store a couple of blocks further up, and Ida\\nstarted for the place indicated, after stopping to inquire when the\\ntrain returned to where she had come from.\\n\\nHe gave her the information, and watched her curiously until she was\\nout of sight.\\n\\n\"It is evident that she has come to Washington simply for the purpose\\nof pawning something. As soon as I reach the other end of my beat I\\nwill make it my business to step into Uncle Samuel\\'s and ask what she\\nhas disposed of. It is just as well for me to know.\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, Ida hurried quickly on her errand.\\n\\nThe pawn-broker\\'s clerk glanced up impatiently as the door opened and\\nthe dark-clad figure glided in.\\n\\n\"I--I should like to see the proprietor, to ask if he will advance me a\\nsum of money on some diamonds.\"\\n\\n\"Have you got them with you?\" asked the man, carelessly.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Ida, faintly; \"but can\\'t I see the proprietor?\"\\n\\n\"You can deal with me just as well,\" he answered.\\n\\nAfter a moment\\'s hesitation, Ida produced the package from her pocket,\\nand unwrapping it, disclosed the magnificent diamonds.\\n\\nA cry of surprise broke from the clerk\\'s lips. In all the years of his\\nlife he had never seen anything so grand as the diamond necklace. But,\\nlike all shrewd men in his calling, he carefully suppressed the cry of\\nastonishment.\\n\\n\"How much do you want to realize on this?\" he asked, indifferently.\\n\\n\"One thousand dollars,\" said Ida, faintly.\\n\\n\"Ha! ha! ha!\" he laughed. \"That\\'s pretty good, when you know full well\\nthat you couldn\\'t realize one-half that sum on them.\"\\n\\n\"But I shall have to!\" cried Ida.\\n\\nThe man closed his hand down over the lid.\\n\\n\"How did you come by these?\" he asked.\\n\\nHe saw the slender figure shiver.\\n\\n\"You have no right to ask me anything like that,\" she replied.\\n\\n\"Probably not,\" returned the man; \"still, when we don\\'t ask, we\\ngenerally do a great deal of guessing. But to end the matter, I will\\nadvance you a couple of hundred on them.\"\\n\\n\"I must have a thousand dollars,\" repeated Ida. \"If it were not\\nabsolutely necessary for me to raise the money on them, I should not\\nhave brought them here.\"\\n\\n\"Two hundred is a nice little sum,\" said the man. \"If you refuse to\\ntake that, I might take it into my head to hold you on suspicion, and\\ncall in a policeman. Bear in mind, I will give you that amount of money\\nwithout asking you where they came from. A policeman would want to\\nknow the whys and wherefores of the whole thing.\"\\n\\n\"I--I _must_ raise a thousand dollars on them,\" she reiterated,\\ngrasping the jewel-case.\\n\\nThe man\\'s bluff had not worked.\\n\\n\"That\\'s all _I\\'ll_ give; but father might accommodate you with a little\\nmore,\" he added, touching a little bell.\\n\\nThe summons was instantly answered by a short, stout little man who\\nlooked as if he had overheard the conversation.\\n\\nA quick glance passed between them.\\n\\n\"Here is something for you to decide,\" went on the young man. \"This\\nlady tells me that she wants a certain amount for these diamonds.\"\\n\\n\"I must have a thousand dollars,\" interposed Ida, \"and if you can\\nnot advance me that amount, do not detain me, please; I must look\\nelsewhere.\"\\n\\nAgain the lid was thrown back, and the casket exposed to the elder\\nman\\'s gaze. He fairly caught his breath as the blazing jewels met his\\neye. A wolfish expression leaped into his face.\\n\\n\"I think I can accommodate the lady,\" he said, blandly. \"My motto is to\\nplease the ladies even if I have to strain a point to do so.\"\\n\\nHe placed his hand in his pocket and brought forth a roll of bills.\\n\\n\"How will you have the money--in tens or twenties?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"It does not matter much,\" said Ida.\\n\\nHe handed her a roll of bills.\\n\\n\"You can count it, and see if the amount you wish is there,\" he said.\\n\\nShe counted it over with trembling hands. Yes, there was just a\\nthousand dollars there.\\n\\n\"You will take great care of the diamonds?\" she asked, eagerly.\\n\\n\"Certainly--certainly. They are as safe in my hands as though they were\\nin your own keeping, lady.\"\\n\\nShe put the money in her pocket, and hurried from the place.\\n\\n\"Abraham! Abraham!\" cried the old man, excitedly, as soon as the street\\ndoor had closed upon her, \"our fortune is made! This necklace is worth\\nat least a cool seventy-five thousand if it\\'s worth a penny, and we\\nhave got it in our possession for a paltry thousand dollars!\"\\n\\n\"I knew the diamonds were very fine, and worth a fortune,\" replied the\\nyoung man; \"but I did not know they were worth as much as that. What do\\nyou intend to do with them, father? You will have to give them up to\\nher if she claims them.\"\\n\\n\"Do you think I\\'m a fool!\" exclaimed the elder man, angrily. \"She\\'ll\\nnever lay eyes on those stones. Depend on that!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LII.\\n\\n\\nIda hurried back to the depot, purchased her ticket, and boarded the\\ntrain for home.\\n\\nShe had scarcely stepped from the ticket-agent\\'s window, ere the\\npoliceman who had directed her to the pawn-shop accosted the agent.\\n\\n\"Where did that veiled woman buy her ticket for? What is her\\ndestination?\" he whispered.\\n\\nHe told him, and the officer jotted down the name of the station in his\\nnote-book.\\n\\nWith the money securely in her possession, Ida reached home. Dusk had\\ncrept up; the stars were out in the sky.\\n\\nShe succeeded in gaining her own room unobserved. She was tired and\\nhungry; indeed, she had not thought of food since she had left the\\nhouse early in the day.\\n\\nShe threw off the long black cloak, the bonnet, thick veil, and black\\ndress she had worn on her visit to Washington. After bathing her face\\nin fragrant water and donning a silken house-robe, Ida rang the bell\\nfor her maid.\\n\\n\"Nora,\" she said, \"you may bring me a cup of tea and a biscuit.\"\\n\\n\"I am very glad that you are awake at last,\" said Nora. \"I wanted very\\nmuch to tell you something; but as you bid me not to disturb you on any\\naccount, I dared not come and knock on the door, ma\\'am.\"\\n\\n\"You are quite right,\" said Ida, wearily, \"not to disturb me. I needed\\nrest--rest,\" said Ida, brokenly.\\n\\n\"I wanted to tell you about the man who was skulking in the grounds.\\nI was hurrying along here a few moments ago, when some one sprung out\\nfrom behind the rose-bushes and grasped me by the arm.\\n\\n\"I certainly would have cried out with terror, but he put his hand over\\nmy mouth.\\n\\n\"\\'Keep still, and I won\\'t hurt you,\\' he said, with an oath.\\n\\n\"Trembling with terror, I stood still. I saw that he was a gentleman;\\nbut I noticed also that he was very much under the influence of wine.\\n\\n\"\\'Tell me, are you one of the maids from the house?\\' he asked.\\n\\n\"\\'Yes,\\' I answered.\\n\\n\"\\'Do you know me?\\' he questioned.\\n\\n\"\\'No,\\' I replied. \\'I am a stranger in the village. I have only been in\\nmy lady\\'s employ a little more than a fortnight.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'I want you to give your mistress _this_,\\' he said, producing an\\nenvelope from his pocket.\"\\n\\nShe did not add that the stranger had given her a bill to insure the\\nsafe delivery of his message, and to keep her from saying anything\\nabout it.\\n\\nAs the girl spoke, she produced an envelope.\\n\\nEven before the hapless Ida saw it, she knew full well from whom it\\ncame.\\n\\nPoor, hapless Ida! She sunk down into the nearest seat, white as she\\nwould ever be in death. She did not dare open it until after the girl\\nhad gone for the tea.\\n\\nShe drank it eagerly.\\n\\n\"Please bring me another cup, Nora,\" she said, \"stronger than the\\nfirst.\"\\n\\n\"I am afraid that you have a fever, my lady,\" said the girl, anxiously.\\n\\n\"I am only thirsty. You may as well take the biscuit back; I am afraid\\nit would choke me,\" said Ida.\\n\\n\"But you must be hungry,\" persisted the maid. \"I am sure you have eaten\\nnothing since breakfast time.\"\\n\\nWhen the girl had gone, Ida tore open the envelope, and read:\\n\\n \"My clever little wife, I am here a day earlier than I anticipated.\\n Meet me at once in the same place. Of course you have the money by\\n this time. Bring it with you.\"\\n\\nShe crushed the note in her hand. No one heard the gasping, the bitter\\nsob, the despairing cry she uttered. The iron had entered her soul.\\nThere was nothing but to obey his commands.\\n\\nThe girl had said that he was under the influence of wine.\\n\\nIda had seen him in that condition once before, and that was on his\\nbridal-eve, and the memory of it had never left her.\\n\\nHe was terrible enough when sober, but under the influence of liquor he\\nmight be a fiend.\\n\\nThe girl brought a second cup of tea, which Ida drank eagerly.\\n\\n\"Now, leave me, Nora,\" she said, \"and do not come again until I ring\\nfor you.\"\\n\\nWith trembling hands, Ida placed the money in her bosom, drew the black\\ncloak over her shoulders, and hurried into the grounds.\\n\\nTrembling with a vague apprehension, she sped by a path that was seldom\\nused down to the brook-side.\\n\\n\"True to your tryst!\" said a well-known voice. \"Fairest, cleverest of\\nwomen, how can I thank you enough for your promptness?\"\\n\\nShe stood still, cold as marble, her face ghastly white in the\\nflickering light of the stars.\\n\\n\"Have you no word for me?\" he cried, with a harsh, derisive laugh.\\n\"Have you no smile, no kiss, no kind word? Have you nothing to say to\\nme? You have no love, no light of welcome in your eyes, and yet you\\nloved me so dearly once, my sweet Ida? Do you remember? And now----\"\\n\\n\"You mocking demon!\" she panted, \"how dare you utter such words to me?\\nI wonder you are not afraid that Heaven will strike you dead where you\\nstand!\"\\n\\n\"Heaven strike me dead?\" he repeated. \"What a horrible idea! Afraid?\\nOh, no, my dear. You are the first charming creature I ever saw who\\nflew into such a rage because her husband was pleased to be sentimental\\nto her.\"\\n\\nHe heard her draw her breath hard. She stood before him white and\\ntrembling, her eyes filled with burning fire.\\n\\n\"Say, Ida, couldn\\'t you manage somehow to get the rest of the\\nmoney--the five thousand?\"\\n\\n\"No!\" she answered, pitifully.\\n\\n\"That\\'s only a bluff,\" he cried. \"But it won\\'t work with me!\"\\n\\n\"You have sworn eternal silence _now_!\" she cried; \"you have given your\\noath, and you dare not break it. I can not raise any more money!\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps you will pay that amount for a little secret which I possess,\\nmy lady,\" he said, mockingly.\\n\\n\"There is nothing more you could tell me that would interest me.\"\\n\\n\"We shall see,\" he replied, sneeringly.\\n\\nHe pulled from under his coat a dark-lantern, shot back the slide, and\\na flood of light illumined the scene. He drew a package from his pocket\\nand unwrapped it. Ida watched him like one in a dream.\\n\\nSuddenly an awful cry broke from her lips. One by one he took from the\\npackage the articles of clothing that had been worn by the little child\\nhe had secured from the village merchant\\'s wife.\\n\\nA cry awful to hear broke from her lips.\\n\\n\"I suppose, Ida, it isn\\'t the proper thing to keep a person in\\nsuspense,\" he cried. \"You deserted your little child--never once sought\\nto discover whether it were dead or alive. By the merest chance, I ran\\nacross it lately. I took possession of it, and I have it now.\"\\n\\n\"I can not, I will not believe you,\" she answered, quickly.\\n\\n\"Perhaps this will convince you,\" he said, reading aloud a letter from\\nthe superintendent of the foundling asylum where the child had been\\nplaced.\\n\\nIt gave a full account of all that could be ascertained of the hapless\\nmother of the child. As he read by the light of the dark-lantern, she\\nknew that it was all true.\\n\\nHer child alive!\\n\\nThe rapture of the thought was drowned in the horror that it was in\\nthis man\\'s possession.\\n\\nShe fell on her face in the long grass, mad with misery and despair.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LIII.\\n\\n\\nFor a moment it seemed as though the darkness of death had come over\\nIda.\\n\\n\"My revelation surprises you,\" Royal Ainsley said, with a most horrible\\nlaugh.\\n\\nThe laugh and the words recalled her to her senses. She sprung to her\\nfeet and faced him.\\n\\n\"Where is my child?\" she cried, wildly. \"Speak, for the love of Heaven,\\nI pray you.\"\\n\\n\"It will cost you just another thousand dollars to find that out. Bring\\nme that amount here to-morrow night at the same hour, and I will give\\nyou full information. Isn\\'t that fair enough?\"\\n\\nPleadings and prayers were alike unavailing.\\n\\n\"Do you suppose I am going to tell you for nothing, when I can make you\\npay handsomely?\"\\n\\n\"But I haven\\'t the money,\" she sobbed, \"and--and you know it!\"\\n\\n\"How did you get this thousand?\" he asked.\\n\\nThen Ida told him all.\\n\\n\"You were a fool to get rid of the diamonds before you had asked Eugene\\nMallard for the money and been refused. Go to him and ask him for the\\nmoney now. He does not know how to refuse a woman, and he will give it\\nto you.\"\\n\\n\"And if I refuse?\" she asked, desperately.\\n\\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n\"Then you and the man you love will be thrown into prison,\" Royal\\ndeclared, \"to serve a term of fifteen or twenty years. After that you\\ncan not complain as to how I brought up your daughter, if she follows\\nin the footsteps of her mother!\"\\n\\nHe could not have used a more conclusive argument.\\n\\n\"Have you no heart, man--no mercy?\" cried Ida.\\n\\n\"Come, come, I say, do not be theatrical; the role does not become you!\\nBetter be sensible, and consider the proposition I make you.\"\\n\\n\"I will leave you now,\" he said; \"but I will be here, at this same\\nhour, to-morrow night.\"\\n\\n\"No, no!\" she cried. \"Give me a week to think it over, and--and to see\\nwhat I can do about raising the money.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, a week, if you must have it,\" he replied; \"but no longer.\\nHere, you can take these proofs of my story regarding your child and\\nlook them over at your leisure,\" he said, thrusting the package into\\nher hand.\\n\\nThe next moment he was gone. She did not faint; she knew that if she\\ndid she would be found there with the package in her hand. She was so\\ndazed, so bewildered, she never remembered how she reached the house\\nand her own room. Again she rang the bell for Nora.\\n\\n\"You may bring me another cup of tea,\" she said, faintly, \"as strong as\\nthe last one.\"\\n\\nThe girl, noticing how pale and ill her mistress looked, thought it\\nwould be best to bring her a glass of wine as well.\\n\\n\"Unless I am very much mistaken, she has a sick spell coming on. Her\\nface is pale, but every now and then it flushes burning red.\"\\n\\nIda did not seek her couch that night until she had eagerly scanned\\nevery article of clothing the parcel contained.\\n\\nHer excitement knew no bounds as she read the letter from the\\nsuperintendent of the foundling asylum, concerning all that he knew\\nof the baby\\'s parentage, in which he stated that the doctor who had\\nattended the young mother had brought the child to the institution in a\\ndying condition, as he supposed, and was hastily called abroad, and had\\nbarely time to make the outgoing steamer. He had told them that they\\ncould tell the hapless young mother when she was able to bear the sad\\nnews.\\n\\nIda wept as she had never wept before as she read those written words,\\nand her excitement increased as she saw that the letter was directed\\nto the village merchant\\'s wife, Mrs. Lester, who had taken the child.\\n\\nIt was, then, her own child that she had clasped in her arms, the eyes\\nof her own babe into which she had gazed with such agony and yet with\\nsuch rapture.\\n\\nThen another fear seized her. She had not seen the little one for weeks.\\n\\nWas it ill? Had anything happened to it? She could not visit Mrs.\\nLester\\'s home until the day broke.\\n\\nHow came her little child in the possession of Royal Ainsley?\\n\\nThe suspense which she endured almost drove her insane. The next\\nmorning she was up as early as the servants were.\\n\\n\"Joe,\" she said to the old coachman, \"I want you to harness up the\\nswiftest horses you have in the stable, and take me to the village. I\\nwant to go to the store kept by the Lesters.\"\\n\\n\"You will not find it open so early in the mornin\\', ma\\'am,\" declared\\nJoe. \"Dem village folk am pow\\'ful lazy.\"\\n\\n\"We will go to their garden, and perhaps be fortunate enough to find\\nthem there,\" said Ida, eagerly. \"Harness the horses at once, Joe.\"\\n\\nThe hapless young mother scarcely breathed during that ride.\\n\\nAfter what seemed to her almost an endless ride, they drew up before\\nthe village store kept by the Lesters.\\n\\nAs Joe had predicted, the door was closed, and the blinds drawn.\\n\\n\"There they are in the garden yonder; at least, there am Mrs. Lester\\nin the strawberry-patch, and there am her husband, off further in the\\nfields.\"\\n\\n\"I will go to her,\" said Ida, stepping quickly from the carriage.\\n\\nSo busy was Mrs. Lester with her task of gathering the ripe fruit, that\\nshe did not know of the presence of her visitor until she stood beside\\nher.\\n\\n\"Mrs. Lester,\" said a quick, eager, husky voice, \"I do hope I have not\\nsurprised you this morning.\"\\n\\n\"Well, well, you have surprised me, for a fact. I suppose you want to\\nget something from the store.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I do, but not just now,\" returned Ida, with feverish impatience.\\n\"Let me sit down here a few moments and talk with you.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" said the woman; \"but I haven\\'t anything out here to invite\\nyou to sit upon, save that little garden-seat which I always take\\naround with me, so that I can rest myself when I get tired.\"\\n\\n\"It will do very well, thank you,\" said Ida, feeling so weak and faint\\nthat she could hardly stand.\\n\\n\"I have not seen you nor your little child lately,\" began Ida.\\n\\nThen she stopped short, lest her quivering voice should betray her\\nterrible anxiety.\\n\\n\"No,\" returned Mrs. Lester. \"I no longer have the little one, bless its\\npoor, dear little heart!\"\\n\\n\"Has anything happened to it?\" asked Ida, the agony of death in her\\nvoice. \"Oh, tell me, where is it? Is the little baby dead?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LIV.\\n\\n\\nIt seemed to Ida that it took ages for the woman to reply. She leaned\\nforward breathlessly, fairly devouring her with her dark, dilated eyes.\\n\\n\"Oh, no! the baby did not die,\" said Mrs. Lester, \"although it was a\\nweak, puny little thing.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll just tell you all about it, for I feel just like talking it over\\nwith some one.\\n\\n\"The child required so much care that my husband decided we could not\\nkeep it, and I was on my way to take it back to the foundling asylum in\\nNew York, when the strangest thing happened.\\n\\n\"In the depot I met a young man who used to live in the village. His\\nname is Royal Ainsley.\"\\n\\n\"Yes! yes!\" interposed Ida, faintly, feeling almost more dead than\\nalive.\\n\\n\"I was telling him all about the baby, showing him the letters that\\ncame with it, and the proofs I had of its identity, when he suddenly\\nexclaimed:\\n\\n\"\\'I will tell you in a few words what I\\'ll do. I\\'ll take this little\\none back to New York, and save you the trip!\\'\\n\\n\"He offered me one hundred dollars to give him the child then and\\nthere. We are very poor, Mrs. Mallard, and a hundred dollars seemed a\\nfortune to me.\\n\\n\"It\\'s over a fortnight since that occurred, but I have not ceased to\\nworry about it, I assure you.\"\\n\\nYoung Mrs. Mallard suddenly staggered to her feet and turned away.\\n\\n\"I think I will not wait any longer,\" said Ida, in a strangely altered\\nvoice. \"Good-morning, Mrs. Lester!\"\\n\\nThe next moment she hurried down the garden-path, and entered her\\ncarriage.\\n\\nLike one wild with terror, Ida hurried back to the carriage and\\nre-entered it.\\n\\n\"Home!\" she said; and old Joe was surprised at the sound of her voice,\\nit was so unnatural.\\n\\n\"What Royal Ainsley told me is indeed too true!\" she said to herself,\\nwith an inward moan. \"He has possession of my little child. Only Heaven\\nknows how he will use his power to crush me, and the fair, sweet,\\ninnocent babe as well!\"\\n\\nIt seemed to her as though the very thought of it would drive her mad.\\nShe knew she was in his power, and that he would certainly use that\\npower to extort every dollar from her that he possibly could. And then,\\nwhen there was no more money to be gained, what would he do?\\n\\nShe avoided Eugene Mallard during the next few days, lest he should\\nrepeat the question he had asked when he last talked with her.\\n\\nHe watched her in wonder. Her apparent coyness amused as well as\\nsurprised him.\\n\\n\"There is no way of understanding women,\" he said to himself. \"To-day\\nthey are eager for something; to-morrow they will not have it!\"\\n\\nHe was surprised when he received a message from her one day, asking\\nhim if she could see him alone in the library.\\n\\nHe sent back a reply in the affirmative, and awaited her coming with\\nsome curiosity, no doubt entering his mind as to what she wished to say.\\n\\nIt was some time before she put in an appearance. He was not aware of\\nher presence, he was gazing so intently out of the window, until she\\nstood by his side.\\n\\n\"Mr. Mallard,\" she began, hesitatingly, \"please pardon me for intruding\\nupon you; but I could not wait.\"\\n\\nHe looked down wonderingly at the lovely young face so strangely pale.\\n\\n\"Would it not be as well for my wife to address me as Eugene?\" he\\nasked, with a grave smile.\\n\\nShe looked up at him and tried to utter the word; but somehow it seemed\\nas though she could not.\\n\\nMy wife!\\n\\nHow those words cut her! If they had been the sharp thrust of a sword,\\nthey could not have cut her deeper.\\n\\nHis wife!\\n\\nShe would have given everything in this world if indeed it were true\\nthat she was Eugene Mallard\\'s wife.\\n\\nAnother face rose before her vision--a fair, handsome, sneering\\nface--and she drew back with a shudder.\\n\\nHe noticed it, and the kindly words he was about to utter were hushed\\non his lips.\\n\\nAfter placing a chair for her, and taking one near it, he waited for\\nher to proceed.\\n\\n\"I--I have come to ask your indulgence in a little matter,\" she said,\\nfaintly.\\n\\n\"Yes?\" he said, kindly.\\n\\nFor a moment there was silence between them--a deep, painful, awkward\\nsilence, which was broken at length by Ida.\\n\\n\"I have been looking over some furniture,\" she said, tremulously,\\n\"and--and I could use just double the amount of money you gave me.\\nWould you be very, very angry if I asked you for a thousand dollars\\nmore?\"\\n\\nHe threw back his head and laughed outright.\\n\\n\"One would think, by the manner in which you express yourself, that\\nyou were suing for some great favor, the granting of which you doubted.\"\\n\\nShe looked at him with dilated eyes, the color coming and going in her\\nface.\\n\\nShe could not understand, by his remark, whether or not he intended\\ngiving it to her.\\n\\nHe turned at once to his desk, saying:\\n\\n\"I will write out a check for the amount you wish.\"\\n\\n\"No; not a check, please,\" she answered, piteously. \"I would so much\\nrather have the money.\"\\n\\nHe looked surprised.\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t the amount you wish,\" he said. \"I have not half that amount\\nprobably. I always use checks in preference to carrying money about\\nwith me.\"\\n\\nHe was quite mystified at the look of terror that crept into her eyes.\\n\\n\"I must have it in cash,\" she said, imploringly. \"Could you not get it\\nfor me somehow?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--certainly,\" he replied. \"When will you want it?\"\\n\\n\"To-night,\" she answered, piteously.\\n\\n\"You shall have it,\" he answered.\\n\\nBut there flashed through his mind a suspicion he would have given\\nanything to have removed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LV.\\n\\n\\nEugene Mallard thought long and earnestly after Ida had left him: \"What\\ncan Ida want with the cash, and in so short a time?\"\\n\\nHe put on his hat, went round to the stables, and ordered his horse. A\\ncanter over the hills would drive away these gloomy, unhappy thoughts.\\n\\nThe sun had crept to its zenith, and was now sinking toward the west as\\nhe reined his horse before the little village inn at Hampton Corners.\\n\\nEvery one knew Eugene Mallard. The proprietor of the hotel on the old\\nVirginia turnpike road warmly welcomed him. He had concluded to rest a\\nlittle and refresh his horse.\\n\\nAs he lighted his cigar and sat down on the porch, the first person he\\nsaw was Dora Staples.\\n\\n\"I am really so delighted to see you, Mr. Mallard,\" she said in her\\npretty lisping accent.\\n\\n\"I had not expected to see you before the fourteenth. We have not had\\nan acknowledgment of the invitation to our ball which we sent you and\\nyour wife a week ago; but I feel sure you won\\'t disappoint us. We count\\nupon you two as our most particular guests.\"\\n\\nEugene flushed hotly.\\n\\n\"Oh, certainly,\" he said. \"I hope you will pardon my not answering your\\nkind favor at once. I will see that my wife writes you and accepts the\\ninvitation.\"\\n\\n\"By the way,\" went on Dora. \"I saw Mr. Hollis only yesterday. We went\\nto Richmond to do some shopping, and the first person I met was Mr.\\nHollis. I am sure he tried to avoid me, though he says he didn\\'t. I\\ntold him about the ball, as I did not know where to send the invitation\\nto him. I told him that you and Mrs. Mallard would be there, and that\\nall we now needed to make the affair as pleasant as the one at your\\nhouse was his presence.\\n\\n\"\\'I will come if I can,\\' he said; \\'but don\\'t feel hard toward me if\\nI should fail to be there. I have a matter of considerable importance\\non hand for that date, and I do not know just how I will be able to\\narrange it.\\'\"\\n\\nEugene Mallard drove slowly homeward. Although he tried to banish\\nDora\\'s words from his mind, yet they still haunted him.\\n\\nWhat was Arthur Hollis doing in Richmond? He was more puzzled over it\\nthan he cared to own.\\n\\nAs he rode up to the door, he saw Ida on the veranda, talking to a\\ngroup of friends. It then struck him as it had never struck him before\\nthat his young wife was very handsome; and he was beginning to wonder\\nhow it was that he had been so blind as to not see that which was\\nattracting the attention of every one else.\\n\\nShe wore a tight-fitting dress of pale-blue silk, with a crimson rose\\nin its bodice. She held a bunch of roses in her white hand. There were\\nseveral other ladies present, but not one of them could compare with\\nher.\\n\\nFor the first time since his marriage a feeling of exultation stole\\ninto his heart at the thought that this peerless creature belonged\\nsolely to him.\\n\\nThey were speaking of the grand ball the Staples\\'s were to give, and\\ncommenting on what they were going to wear.\\n\\n\"How about _you_, Mrs. Mallard? What are _you_ going to wear? Don\\'t\\nkeep what you are going to wear a secret, and then spring some\\nwonderful creation upon our wondering gaze.\"\\n\\n\"I assure you,\" said Ida, \"that I have no intention of doing anything\\nof the kind. Indeed,\" she declared, earnestly, \"in sending out the\\ninvitations, I am _sure_ they have forgotten us!\"\\n\\nAt this juncture, Eugene stepped forward, saying:\\n\\n\"Is there any excuse a man can offer for forgetting so great a favor\\nas an invitation to a grand ball? That is exactly what has occurred.\\nI received the invitation for the Staples\\'s ball one day last\\nweek. I should have taken it direct to my wife, but you know that\\n\\'procrastination is the thief of time.\\' It has proved so in this case.\\nI laid it down, and in the press of other matters, I forgot it. My\\npapers must have covered it, and the matter entirely escaped my mind\\nuntil to-day.\"\\n\\n\"Of course you will go?\" remarked the ladies in chorus.\\n\\n\"Oh, yes; we are sure to do so,\" he responded.\\n\\nA little later he found Ida alone in the drawing-room.\\n\\n\"I do hope you will look your best at this particular ball,\" he said.\\n\"The governor of the State; in fact, any number of my old friends will\\nbe there. I want you to wear your most becoming dress, and all the\\nfamily diamonds.\"\\n\\nIda had been looking down calmly at the roses she held. But as mention\\nof the diamonds fell from her husband\\'s lips, a change that was\\nalarming came over her face.\\n\\nShe grew white as death; her eyes lost their light. The roses which she\\nheld fell to her feet.\\n\\n\"Why, Ida, you look as if it were an occasion for sorrow instead of one\\nof joy,\" Eugene remarked.\\n\\n\"What is the date of the ball?\" she asked.\\n\\n\"The fourteenth,\" he responded.\\n\\nAgain that ashen pallor spread over her face, leaving it white to the\\nlips.\\n\\nThat was the date upon which Royal Ainsley was to bring her child to\\nher.\\n\\nWhat was the great ball to her compared with this event?\\n\\nWhile in the village Eugene had got the money she had asked of him. He\\nhad handed it to her inclosed in an envelope.\\n\\nOh, how kind and good he was to her! How very despicable it was to\\ndeceive him! But what could she do? Fate was against her.\\n\\nEugene could not help but notice the intense excitement under which she\\nlabored during the time that elapsed to the coming of the ball. She\\nlonged, yet dreaded to have the day arrive.\\n\\nThe day came at last, bright and clear. There was no cloud in the blue\\nsky; the sun shone brightly in the heavens. She was glad that there\\nwere several guests at the house, as her husband would not have much\\nopportunity of observing her.\\n\\nHow that day passed she never knew. One moment she was as white as\\ndeath, the next she flushed as red as a rose.\\n\\n\"Heaven help me to live over the excitement of to-day!\" she murmured,\\nclasping her hands tightly.\\n\\nShe prayed for the noonday to linger. But time, which stays at no man\\'s\\nbidding, rolled on. The sun went down in a sweep of crimson glory; dusk\\ngathered and deepened into the darkness of night.\\n\\nSeven o\\'clock sounded from the pearl-and-gold clock on the mantel.\\nSeven o\\'clock resounded from the great brass-throated clock in the main\\nhall.\\n\\n\"Nora,\" said Ida to her maid, \"go down to the library and tell Mr.\\nMallard that I am indisposed and can not go with him to the ball, but\\nthat I earnestly pray he will go without me, and enjoy himself. Say\\nthat I wish particularly that he should go; and notice what he says,\\nNora, and come back and tell me.\"\\n\\nIt seemed to Ida that Nora would never deliver the message.\\n\\nWhy did she linger? At last the girl returned.\\n\\n\"What did he say, Nora?\" she asked, breathlessly, fixing her startled\\neyes eagerly on the girl\\'s face.\\n\\n\"He made no reply, ma\\'am,\" returned Nora; \"but I am sure he will go,\\nsince you so earnestly requested it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LVI.\\n\\n\\nIt was with the greatest surprise that Eugene Mallard received the\\nmessage that Nora delivered--that Ida was too ill to attend the grand\\nball with him.\\n\\n\"She did not seem to be ill this afternoon,\" he said to himself.\\n\\nObeying a sudden impulse, he hurried from the room, intent upon going\\nto Ida\\'s _boudoir_ and offering her his sympathy; but, on second\\nthought, he concluded that in all probability she would not care to be\\ndisturbed.\\n\\nHe felt grievously disappointed. He knew that many of his friends would\\nbe present; and besides, what could he say to Mrs. Staples and her\\ndaughters?\\n\\nSome of her friends had left Ida apparently in the best of health\\nand spirits at noon. How could he account to them for her sudden\\nindisposition?\\n\\nDuring the forenoon he saw that there was something on Ida\\'s mind; that\\nshe was greatly troubled.\\n\\nPerhaps the words he had said to her only a short time before had much\\nto do with her indisposition. He felt that he ought to have a talk with\\nIda. If he were to reassure her that she could have everything her own\\nway, she might feel much relieved.\\n\\nA second time he started for her _boudoir_; but again he drew back. He\\ncould not tell what prompted him to do so.\\n\\n\"Such strange, contradictory emotions seem to possess me,\" he said. \"I\\nwill go out into the grounds and smoke a cigar. That will quiet me a\\nlittle, and afterward I will have a talk with Ida.\"\\n\\nEugene Mallard wandered about the grounds for half an hour or more. He\\nheard a clock strike the hour of eight.\\n\\nHow dark and gloomy it was! There was no moon, but the stars shed a\\nfaint, glimmering light.\\n\\nHe had smoked a cigar; but still he paced aimlessly up and down the\\ngrounds, lost in thought.\\n\\nHe came to one of the garden benches. It looked so inviting that he\\nthrew himself down upon it.\\n\\nHow long he sat there he never knew. Presently he was disturbed by the\\nsound of slow, cautious footsteps. It could not be one of the servants\\nstealing through the grounds in that manner. It must be some poacher.\\n\\nHe drew back into the shadow of the trees, and watched with no little\\ncuriosity. He had been so kind to the villagers that he felt surprised\\nat this apparent ingratitude.\\n\\nPresently a figure came down the path. The more he watched the figure\\nthe more certain he became that he had seen it before. Its every move\\nseemed familiar to him.\\n\\nSuddenly a thought flashed into his mind that made him hold his breath.\\n\\n\"Great Heavens! can it be Arthur Hollis?\" he ejaculated.\\n\\nHis face paled; great flashes of fire seemed to come from his eyes. The\\nvery blood in his veins seemed to stagnate. Faint and dizzy, he leaned\\nback against the trunk of a tree.\\n\\nGreat God! what could it mean? His wife supposed him to be by this time\\non his way to the ball. During his absence would she meet, dared she\\nmeet Arthur Hollis?\\n\\nThe tall, familiar-looking figure paced impatiently by the brook-side\\nunder the dim light of the stars. Yes, the man was there waiting for\\nsome one.\\n\\nFrom where he stood he could plainly see a faint light in the window\\nof his wife\\'s room, and as his eyes were fixed upon it, the light was\\nextinguished.\\n\\nIf a sword had been plunged into Eugene Mallard\\'s heart, it could not\\nhave given him a greater shock.\\n\\nMany a night he had paced up and down the grounds, watching the light\\nin that window. Then it had never been put out before ten. Why should\\nit be extinguished so early to-night?\\n\\nThe thought troubled Eugene Mallard, as he turned his head and saw the\\nfigure still pacing restlessly up and down by the brook.\\n\\nHe dared not utter a word. He would await developments. He scarcely\\nbreathed, in his suspense. It seemed to him that the blood in his veins\\nwas turned to ice.\\n\\nHe took up a position where there was no possible danger of being\\nobserved, and there he watched and waited.\\n\\nUp in her _boudoir_ Ida was donning with trembling hands, the long\\ncloak that was to disguise her.\\n\\nShe had sent Nora from her room. But it seemed to her that the girl\\nlooked back suspiciously as she went out and closed the door after her.\\n\\n\"Heaven help me to get through with this exciting scene!\" Ida muttered.\\n\\nHer heart was throbbing so, her limbs were so weak, that she was\\nobliged to sit down for a minute.\\n\\n\"Oh, Heaven help me! How thankful I am that Eugene did not send for me\\nbefore he left for the ball. He has reached there by this time!\" she\\nmuttered.\\n\\nShe looked at the clock, and said to herself that time was flying, and\\nshe must hasten to keep her appointment.\\n\\nAgain she counted over the money which Eugene had given her--the money\\nthat was to restore her little child to her--the money that was to\\npurchase her freedom and end forever Royal Ainsley\\'s persecutions.\\n\\n\"What would Eugene say if he knew all?\" she asked herself, in great\\ntrepidation.\\n\\nShe trembled even at the thought of it.\\n\\nWas she doing right in concealing the truth from Eugene Mallard?\\n\\nShe sprung from her chair and paced hurriedly up and down the room.\\n\\nIf Eugene knew all, he would certainly tell her that her path lay with\\nRoyal Ainsley, that his roof would shelter her no more. And now she\\ncould not part from him. Every fiber of her heart was woven about him.\\n\\nShe tried to look into the future; but, think what she would, the\\npictures presented frightened her.\\n\\nPresently she paused before the window. Was it only her fancy, or did\\nshe hear the patter of rain-drops?\\n\\nShe turned out the light and threw open the window. She felt relieved\\nto find that it was only the leaves that were tapping against the\\nwindow-pane. She closed the window, with a sigh, and opened the door\\nsoftly.\\n\\nThe corridor was empty; the gas-jets of the great chandelier were\\nturned low. Like a thief in the night, she stole noiselessly down the\\nwinding passageway.\\n\\nThe sound of laughter from the servants\\' hall below floated up to her\\nthrough the awful stillness.\\n\\nWhat if one of the doors on either side should open, and some one step\\nout and confront her?\\n\\nShe drew her long cloak closely about her, and pulled the hood down\\nover her head.\\n\\nThere was a side door opening on to a porch, and leading directly into\\nthe grounds.\\n\\nIda hurried toward this door and opened it cautiously. For a moment\\nshe stood on the threshold, and in that moment a gust of wind blew the\\ncloak from about her shoulders, and it fell at her feet.\\n\\nThe light from the hall lamp clearly revealed her form to Eugene\\nMallard, who stood leaning against an oak-tree scarcely one hundred\\nfeet distant.\\n\\n\"It is Ida!\" he muttered, hoarsely.\\n\\nShe turned her steps down toward the brook, as he had feared she would\\ndo.\\n\\n\"She stayed away from the ball to meet that scoundrel!\" he muttered\\nunder his breath.\\n\\nWith hesitating steps, little dreaming of what the end of her adventure\\nwould be, Ida hurried on to her doom.\\n\\nThe wind sighed a mournful requiem in the trees, the songs of the birds\\nwere hushed, and the sweet murmur of the brook seemed to end in a sob\\nas it rushed onward to the sea.\\n\\nThe night was warm, but a great shiver crept over Ida as she turned out\\nof the path and hurried along through the garden by a short cut to the\\nplace where she knew Royal Ainsley was impatiently waiting for her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LVII.\\n\\n\\nRoyal Ainsley was not a man to be trusted when under the influence of\\ndrink. As the minutes went by, and Ida did not come, he was beside\\nhimself with rage.\\n\\n\"What does she mean by keeping me waiting in this manner?\" he roared.\\n\"By the Lord Harry, I\\'ll make her pay for this!\"\\n\\nThen, like Eugene Mallard, who was watching but a few feet from him, he\\nsaw the light go out in Ida\\'s room.\\n\\n\"That must be _her_ room. She is coming at last,\" he murmured.\\n\\nHe braced himself against the trunk of a tree, for by this time his\\nlimbs were none too steady under him.\\n\\nWhen the door opened, and he saw Ida approach, an exclamation of\\nsatisfaction broke from his lips.\\n\\nHe sat down upon the mossy rock and watched the slim figure as it moved\\nslowly over the greensward.\\n\\n\"She is certainly in no hurry to see me,\" he muttered, with a grim\\nsmile. \"But I\\'ll change all that.\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, Ida had stopped short, and was standing motionless in the\\npath.\\n\\nPutting her hand into the pocket of her dress, the girl found, to her\\ngreat amazement, that she had come away without the roll of bills she\\nhad intended to bring with her. In her excitement she had left the\\nmoney on the table.\\n\\nWhat should she do? There was no course to pursue but go back for it.\\n\\nThen a superstitious terror for which she could not account seemed to\\nseize her.\\n\\n\"It will surely be a bad omen to return to the house.\" she told\\nherself; \"and yet I dare not meet Royal Ainsley without the money. He\\nwill say that my story about forgetting the money is only an excuse.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LVIII.\\n\\n\\nAs Ida paused for a moment, wondering what course would be best to\\npursue, she concluded that her only course would be to return to the\\nhouse for the money.\\n\\nShe had scarcely turned, before a piercing cry sounded through the\\ngrounds, coming from the direction of the brook.\\n\\nIda, terrified, stood for a moment rooted to the spot. She tried to\\nfly, but if her life had depended upon it, she could not have stirred\\nhand or foot.\\n\\nShe distinctly heard the sound of voices. Still, all power to fly\\nseemed to have left her.\\n\\nWhat could it be? Had some of the servants discovered Royal Ainsley\\'s\\npresence?\\n\\nShe tried to think, but she was powerless. Every sound seemed confusing.\\n\\nGuided by the light, Nora had dashed quickly down toward the brook.\\nBut ere she could reach the figure pacing up and down so impatiently,\\nshe was seized from behind by a pair of strong arms, a white angry\\nface bent over her, and a voice, which she instantly recognized as her\\nmaster\\'s, cried harshly:\\n\\n\"Let me understand what this means!\"\\n\\nThe girl was too frightened to speak.\\n\\n\"This is why you would not come to the ball, is it?\" he cried,\\nexcitedly, dragging her toward the spot where her lover stood. \"Come,\\nyou and I will confront the lover whom you stayed away from the ball to\\nmeet here!\"\\n\\nRoyal Ainsley took in the situation at once. He recognized Eugene\\'s\\nvoice.\\n\\n\"He has discovered Ida Mallard\\'s appointment with me in some way,\" he\\nthought. And the knowledge terrified him, coward as he was.\\n\\nHe turned and beat a hasty retreat, dodging directly into the arms of\\nold Joe.\\n\\n\"Ha! I\\'ve caught you _this_ time!\" cried the old servitor.\\n\\nWith an oath, Royal Ainsley flung Joe from him.\\n\\n\"Out of my way!\" he cried, fiercely, \"or I\\'ll kill you!\"\\n\\nThe voice, as well as the words, startled old Joe, and threw him\\nentirely off his guard for an instant. In that instant a heavy blow was\\ndealt him which caused him to loosen his hold on the intruder.\\n\\nThen Royal Ainsley sped like a deer through the grounds, every foot of\\nwhich he knew well, and was quickly lost to sight in the darkness.\\n\\nAfter that first sharp cry, Nora regained something of her natural\\nbravado.\\n\\nIn less time than it takes to tell it, her master had dragged her\\ntoward the house and under the full light of the swinging lamp.\\n\\n\"Oh, master!\" she cried, gaining her breath at last \"It\\'s I, Nora, the\\nmaid!\"\\n\\nEugene Mallard\\'s tightly clinched hands fell from her; he stared aghast\\nat the girl.\\n\\n\"You, Nora!\" he cried, in the greatest amazement, with a world of\\nrelief and thankfulness blended in his voice.\\n\\n\"Pray for--forgive me, Mr. Mallard,\" sobbed the girl. \"I--I did not do\\nany intentional wrong. I was only going down to the old south gate to\\nmeet my lover, sir. I--I did not think for a moment that any one would\\nmind. My lady did not need me for an hour or more. Oh, please forgive\\nme if my action has displeased you!\"\\n\\n\"It was your lover that you were going to meet?\" repeated Eugene\\nMallard, as if to satisfy himself that he had heard aright.\\n\\nHe drew back and looked at Nora with fixed intentness, the color that\\nhad left his face surging back to it again.\\n\\nEugene Mallard now walked to his library, and flung himself down to\\nthink over the situation.\\n\\nHe felt grateful beyond words that matters were no worse. He was\\nashamed of the thought that for a moment had found lodgment in his\\nbrain against the wife whom he had wedded.\\n\\nThen it came to him--his love for Ida, whom he knew now that he\\nworshipped with all the passionate love of his heart. How different it\\nwas from the love he had borne Hildegarde Cramer!\\n\\nHe wondered that he had been so blind as not to have noticed his love\\nfor her sooner. He could scarcely wait until the day dawned, that\\nhe might go to her and tell her of the great love for her that was\\nconsuming his soul.\\n\\nHe said to himself that it was only her innate modesty that caused her\\nto hold aloof from him of late, and to make her hesitate about giving\\nhim her answer.\\n\\nHe looked shudderingly backward over the past for the last time. Yes,\\nhe would urge her to give him his answer on the morrow. It never once\\noccurred to him but that her answer would be \"Yes.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LIX.\\n\\n\\nWhen Royal Ainsley shook himself free from old Joe\\'s detaining grasp,\\nhis first impulse was to get as far away from the place as possible.\\n\\nWith second thoughts, however, came another decision. No; he must learn\\nall that was taking place.\\n\\nQuickly circling the grounds, he soon gained a vantage-place behind a\\ngroup of bushes not far from the house. There he could easily see and\\nhear all that transpired without being seen himself.\\n\\nHe saw Eugene Mallard as he drew the girl beneath the swinging lamp in\\nthe hall, and heard the conversation that passed between them.\\n\\n\"So!\" he muttered, grinding his white teeth savagely, \"the girl is my\\nlady\\'s maid, eh? I dare say, she sent her with some message to me when\\nshe was intercepted by Eugene Mallard. But Ida will find that this will\\nnot work with me. See her I shall, if I have to stay in these grounds\\ntill broad daylight.\"\\n\\nHe watched and waited until he saw even old Joe relax his vigilance and\\ngo into the house.\\n\\nRoyal Ainsley waited there until the old mansion was wrapped in gloom\\nand darkness, then he slipped from his hiding-place, passed noiselessly\\nover the graveled walk, and stood beneath Ida\\'s window.\\n\\nStooping, he caught up a handful of pebbles. One by one he flung them\\nup against the window-pane. Just as he had expected, he saw a white,\\nterrified face appear at the window, and two white hands threw up the\\nsash.\\n\\nHe saw at once that it was Ida. He moved out from the shadow of the\\ntrees. She saw him at once, and recognized him.\\n\\n\"Is it _you_?\" she cried, in the greatest alarm. \"What in Heaven\\'s name\\nare you doing there, pray?\"\\n\\n\"Your common sense ought to tell you _that_;\" he retorted, harshly.\\n\"Come down here at once, I tell you, and be sure to bring that money\\nwith you!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no! no! I can not!\" she answered him, piteously.\\n\\n\"Why?\" he demanded, with something very much like an imprecation upon\\nhis lips.\\n\\n\"I dropped the money in the dining-room as I was passing through it to\\nget out into the grounds. The room is locked; I can not get it until\\nto-morrow morning. Old Joe always carries the key with him.\"\\n\\n\"It is a lie!\" he cried, fiercely.\\n\\n\"No! no! On my life, it is true!\" she answered, with a piteous quiver\\nin her voice; adding: \"I was hurrying through the room, and there I\\nmust have dropped it. I searched for it in every other place.\"\\n\\n\"Then hear what I say,\" he retorted, with an oath, \"in these very\\ngrounds I shall stay until you come to me. I know well that old Joe is\\nastir at dawn. You must be up then, find the money which you say you\\ndropped, and bring it out to me. I will be waiting for you at the same\\nplace.\"\\n\\nBefore she could utter a word of protest, he had turned and disappeared\\nin the darkness.\\n\\nAll night long Ida Mallard paced the floor of her room, scarcely\\nheeding the hours that dragged their slow lengths by. Dawn came before\\nshe realized it. She was startled from her reverie by hearing old Joe\\nthrowing open the shutters about the house. That recalled her to a\\nrealization of passing events.\\n\\nJoe had unlocked the door of the dining-room at last, but his sight was\\nso poor that he could not espy a small roll of bills lying on the floor.\\n\\nIda, gliding into the room as soon as his footsteps echoed down the\\ncorridor, found the package.\\n\\nShe stole to the door as soon as it was unlocked.\\n\\nAh! how sweet and fragrant was the early morning. How cool and green\\nthe grass looked, wet with the morning dew! Little she dreamed that ere\\nthe day waned that same grass would be dyed with a human being\\'s blood.\\n\\nShe shivered as she stepped forth into the grounds. With hurried steps\\nshe crossed the lawn, and went into the rose-garden beyond. There she\\nsaw Royal Ainsley. He was pacing the little path by the brook, his face\\nwhite, his eyes angry-looking, downcast and sullen.\\n\\n\"So you have come at last, eh?\" he exclaimed, angrily.\\n\\n\"I am here,\" she responded, tremulously.\\n\\n\"I was just about to go and wake up the household,\" he cried, his rage\\nincreasing.\\n\\n\"Now, that I am here, you will not have to do that,\" she answered,\\nwearily.\\n\\n\"Where is the money?\" he asked, abruptly.\\n\\nShe held it in her hand, but clutched it more tightly.\\n\\n\"I have it with me,\" she responded; \"but it is not yours until you\\ncarry out your promises!\"\\n\\nHe looked at her with a cunning gleam in his eyes.\\n\\n\"To be sure I will carry out my agreement,\" he said.\\n\\n\"But I must have proof that you will do so before I part with so much\\nmoney,\" she said. \"You must give me your written word that you will\\nnever trouble me again. You must also tell me where I can find my\\nchild, for I see that you have not kept your word about bringing her\\nwith you!\"\\n\\nHe laughed aloud--a harsh, mocking laugh.\\n\\n\"I am not surprised at hearing a remark like that from your lips. A\\nwoman who could abandon her child as easily as _you_ did, without so\\nmuch as knowing its fate, and who is content to live here as Eugene\\nMallard\\'s wife, whenever he is ready to take you to his heart, is\\ncapable of doing anything. I do not wonder that you supposed the little\\none was here in the grounds all night long awaiting your fancy to\\nappear!\"\\n\\nShe recoiled at the words as though he had struck her a blow.\\n\\n\"Let me tell you where your child is,\" he said, hoarsely. \"You shall\\nknow its fate!\"\\n\\nAs he spoke, he seized the hand that held the money, and tore the bills\\nfrom her grasp.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LX.\\n\\n\\nIda sunk on her knees before him.\\n\\n\"Come,\" he said; \"you must go quietly with me.\"\\n\\n\"Inhuman monster!\" moaned Ida.\\n\\n\"Come. This is no time to exchange compliments,\" he said. \"We have\\nparleyed here too long already.\"\\n\\nHis grasp tightened on the slender wrist, but she did not seem to heed\\nthe pain of it.\\n\\n\"I can not, I will not go with you!\" she panted.\\n\\nA taunting laugh answered her. He was dragging her by main force down\\nthe path, when the figure of a man suddenly sprung before him.\\n\\n\"You!\" cried Royal Ainsley, furiously.\\n\\n\"Yes, it is I!\" returned Eugene Mallard, sternly. \"I am just in time,\\nit appears, to save my--this lady from you.\"\\n\\nAt the sight of Eugene, Ida flung up her hands with a wild cry, and\\nsunk at his feet unconscious. Royal Ainsley sprung forward to catch her\\nin his arms, but Eugene dashed up to him.\\n\\n\"Lay one hand on her at your peril!\" he commanded.\\n\\n\"And who shall prevent me, when she is my wife?\" sneered Royal Ainsley.\\n\\n\"She is _not_ your wife!\" cried Eugene Mallard, his face darkening;\\n\"and here and now, I propose to avenge the wrongs you have done her.\\nThere will be a duel to the death between us! I have two pistols in my\\npocket, you shall take one and defend yourself, I will use the other.\"\\n\\nRoyal Ainsley sprung forward. Quick as a flash he drew something from\\nhis vest-pocket. It was a sharp steel dagger which he always carried.\\n\\nHe made a lunge forward, but his foot slipped, and he fell to the earth\\nin mortal pain. The dagger he had intended to plunge into the body of\\nhis cousin had been the cause of his own death.\\n\\nIn an instant Eugene was bending over him.\\n\\n\"It is too late!\" gasped the miserable man--\"it is all over with me\\nnow. I am about to pass in my checks. Don\\'t you think so?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Eugene; \"you are mortally wounded, I can see that. Heaven\\nforgive you for the sins you have committed!\"\\n\\nEugene carried Ida to her own room, thanking Heaven that he had met no\\none. No one would know of her presence in the grounds.\\n\\nThen he quickly summoned the servants.\\n\\nRoyal Ainsley, lying there with his face upturned to the sunlight and\\nhis hand clutching the fatal dagger, told its own story.\\n\\nAs soon as Ida was able to see him Eugene sent for her to come to the\\nlibrary.\\n\\nWhen she received the summons, the poor soul, white as death, fell upon\\nher knees.\\n\\n\"He is going to denounce me for my sin, and for not telling him when I\\nfound it out,\" she said.\\n\\nCould she face him, now that he knew all?\\n\\nAs she knelt there she caught a glimpse of herself in the great mirror\\nopposite.\\n\\nAgain the girl knocked at the door.\\n\\n\"Tell your master that I will see him to-morrow,\" she whispered in a\\nstrained, strange voice; and the girl went away.\\n\\nStrange fancies seemed to throng through her brain.\\n\\nRoyal Ainsley was dead, she had heard them say; and she fancied that\\nher child was dead, too.\\n\\nAnd now the man she loved had sent for her to turn her from the house,\\nand she would never see him again.\\n\\nThen she thought of the brook, so deep, so wide, that struggled on to\\nmeet the sea.\\n\\nYes, she would go there where some of the happiest, ay, and some of\\nthe most sorrowful moments of her life had been spent. The deep waters\\nwould carry her away on their bosom.\\n\\nAt intervals the girl came to the door to inquire if she wanted\\nanything. The answer was always the same--\"No.\"\\n\\nShe never knew how the long hours passed; she was like one in a dream.\\n\\nAt last night came. She waited until the house was dark and still.\\nThere was silence in the hall. All the lights were out, every one was\\nasleep, and the troubles of the day were blotted out.\\n\\nShe raised the long French window that opened out onto the lawn and\\nstepped out into the garden.\\n\\nAs she passed the room in which Eugene Mallard was quietly sleeping,\\nshe knelt and laid her cold white lips on the threshold his feet would\\npress.\\n\\nHow cruelly Heaven had punished her, because in those other days she\\nhad longed to be a lady, like the heroines she had read of in the great\\nworld of beauty and fashion.\\n\\nShe reached the brook and knelt down beside it. The moon threw a\\nsilvery light upon it, and in its song she seemed to hear Eugene\\'s\\nvoice mingled with that of the little child she had lost.\\n\\n\"I am coming to you, little baby!\" she muttered below her breath. Then\\naloud, she said: \"Good-bye, Eugene--good-bye forever!\"\\n\\nSuddenly a pair of strong arms clasped her, and Eugene\\'s voice\\nwhispered:\\n\\n\"Not good-bye, my darling!\"\\n\\nOnly the stars and the moonlight and the rippling waters of the brook\\nheard what he said--how he pleaded with her to live only for him and\\nher little child.\\n\\nIda could not believe the great happiness that had suddenly fallen upon\\nher like a mantle from God\\'s hands.\\n\\nThey talked by the brook-side for long hours. The next day the master\\nand mistress of the great mansion went away.\\n\\nWhen they reached New York, another ceremony was performed, which made\\nIda Eugene Mallard\\'s wife until death should part them.\\n\\nThen they quietly went and obtained the little child, whom both\\nidolized, and went abroad, where they remained for years.\\n\\nNo one learned the strange romance of the fair young girl whom Eugene\\nMallard worshipped so fondly.\\n\\nWhen they returned to their home, years after, with a lovely, dark-eyed\\nlittle girl and a sturdy, blue-eyed boy, no one guessed but that they\\nwere Eugene Mallard\\'s children.\\n\\nWhile they had been abroad they read of the marriage of Hildegarde\\nCramer to Philip Ravenswood, the noble young man who had loved her ever\\nsince they had first met on the Newport sands.\\n\\nThe same paper also brought the intelligence of the engagement of\\nArthur Hollis and pretty Dora Staples, and the sad ending, in a\\nrailroad accident, of beautiful, hapless Vivian Deane and her maid Nora.\\n\\nEugene passed the paper to his wife, and Ida read it, making no\\ncomments. But after awhile, as though the subject weighed heavily on\\nher mind, she went up to Eugene, and laid her soft white arms round his\\nneck, and whispered:\\n\\n\"Does the knowledge of Hildegarde\\'s marriage bring you any regrets,\\nEugene?\"\\n\\n\"No, my darling!\" he cried, clasping her in his strong arms. \"For all\\nthe love of my heart is yours now, and--and--our children\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"I have often wanted to ask you, Eugene,\" she murmured, with her face\\nhidden on his breast, \"if the story of my past were known, how would\\npeople judge me? Would the world say, \\'Ida May had sinned\\'?\"\\n\\nLet us hope all our readers will join heartily in his answer--\"No.\"\\n\\n\\nTHE END.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  THE A. and L.

Vijay Bhaskar, chairperson of the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB), on Monday indicated that the short and long term measures to contain froth in the Bellandur and Varthur lakes may take five years to fructify. He said that the board has taken a slew of measures, including construction of sewage treatment plants (STPs), to treat all the water flowing into the lakes.\\n\\nAround 800 million litres of sewage flows into the two lakes every day. “As an immediate measure, BBMP has taken up spraying while BWSSB is fixing a mesh. The Bangalore Development Authority will be building a ramp so that the water flows gently, instead of dropping from a height,” he said.\\n\\nAs a mid-term solution, the sewage will be diverted away from the lakes. As part of long-term measures, STPs with a capacity of 398 MLD have been proposed. “Already, there is an installed capacity of around 250 MLD while STPs for 150 MLD are under construction.

      "{'text': 'On July 13th, 2018, we released the Rate3 Locking Program, giving our Rate3 community members the opportunity to reserve their spot as Credit Nodes and receive great rewards at the same time.\\n\\nCredit Nodes are non-institutional funds or financial institutions. They are typically community members who are more vested in the Rate3 ecosystem and want to play a greater role.\\n\\nHence, to allow for users to have an early priority registration for our Credit Nodes, we engineered a smart contract in Solidity to allow users to Stake and Lock their RTE tokens for interest and gain priority registration as a Credit Node in 2019.\\n\\nThe Rate3 Locking Program\\n\\nWe learned a great lot during the process and would love to share our learnings with the DApp community.\\n\\nSo, what is a DApp?\\n\\nDApp is an abbreviated form for decentralized application.\\n\\nInstead of having the backend code written and hosted on centralized servers, a DApp has its backend code running on a decentralized peer-to-peer network.\\n\\nA DApp can have frontend code and user interfaces written in any language (just like an app) that can make calls to its backend.\\n\\nWhat is our DApp about?\\n\\nThe Rate3 Vault Program\\n\\nUsers are allowed to stash and lock their RTE tokens for later, various rewards in the form of an additional annualized interest depending on how long it is locked for. It gives them the opportunity to gain priority access when Rate3 formally open up Credit Nodes registration in Q1 2019.\\n\\nYou check out our DApp at https://vault.rate3.network/\\n\\nTech Stack and General Architecture\\n\\nFor this project, we used the following stack:\\n\\nSolidity Smart Contracts to communicate on the Ethereum blockchain.\\n\\nTruffle and Ganache for our development and testing framework\\n\\nMetaMask for our web3 provider in production\\n\\nReact / MobX / Material Design + Bootstrap for our front-end development. (P.S. You can check out how we set up our Front End projects at Rate here.)\\n\\nSmart Contracts\\n\\nThe core functionality of the Rate3 Vault Program is only made possible by Ethereum’s smart contract functionality. We not only make frequent use of ERC20 methods such as approve and transferFrom , but also events which allows for responsiveness in our front-end whenever a transaction has been completed & verified.\\n\\nFrom Investopedia,\\n\\nSmart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. The code and the agreements contained therein exist across a distributed, decentralized blockchain network. Smart contracts permit trusted transactions and agreements to be carried out among disparate, anonymous parties without the need for a central authority, legal system, or external enforcement mechanism. They render transactions traceable, transparent, and irreversible.\\n\\nTruffle & Ganache\\n\\nTruffle is a development environment, testing framework and asset pipeline for Ethereum, aiming to make life as an Ethereum developer easier. It is a great set of tools (written in Javascript) that makes deploying your Ethereum contracts much easier. We used it to compile and deploy our smart contracts to a local Ethereum server.\\n\\nGanache, part of the Truffle suite of Ethereum development tools, is your personal blockchain for Ethereum development. It ships with an internal Javascript implementation (EthereumJS) to simulate full client behavior and make developing Ethereum applications faster, easier, and safer. It also includes all popular RPC functions and features (like events) and can be run deterministically to make development a breeze.\\n\\nChai & Mocha was also used as our testing framework to test our smart contracts.\\n\\nMetaMask\\n\\nWe require that users install MetaMask to interact with our smart contract on our website, for users who do not want to go through alternative flows such as using MyEtherWallet. Working with MetaMask was pretty straightforward, with a few exceptions:\\n\\nDealing with changes in user accounts for MetaMask state is not ideal. The recommended approach is to run an interval that repeatedly checks the current account. Fortunately for us, our interaction session is short (i.e. the user should be done within minutes), and hence this is not that much of an issue. From a UX standpoint, it was made sure that the user’s address is shown at all times. Bugs can happen all the time. For example, catching errors were broken on production for a few days (all DApps that rely on MetaMask would not be able to catch errors during then). Metamask can also hang indefinitely, an issue that is still currently live. Getting data from MetaMask requires a callback parameter, hence encouraging callback hell. Though, we did write a javascript function to overcome this. (We open-sourced it as well, read on!)\\n\\nThat said, MetaMask is a fantastic open source project, and the DApp ecosystem would be nowhere near what it is today without it.', 'meta': {'pile_set_name': 'OpenWebText2'}}\n",
      "{'text': 'Asheville\\'s HGTV house debuts with sweepstakes\\n\\nASHEVILLE – Asheville architect Aaron Wilson typically spends far more than three weeks designing houses, but when the cable network HGTV approached him about plans for a West Asheville bungalow, he jumped at the chance to get involved with the project. Along with local builder Jody Guokas, he created the HGTV Urban Oasis in about 100 days.\\n\\nThe house, 17 Russell St., serves as the prize of a national sweepstakes and the focus of a TV special on the network.\\n\\nThe sweepstakes runs Thursday through Sept. 24 on the network\\'s website, and the TV special premieres at 11 p.m. Monday. Reruns air Aug. 14 and 24 and Sept. 8, 20 and 23 at various hours, although that schedule is subject to change.\\n\\nWilson said he frequently renovates bungalows like the 1,300-square-foot house on Russell Street, although not usually with so many intricate design elements and never on such a tight schedule.\\n\\n\"There are a lot of houses just like that — single-story bungalow with a pitched roof,\" he said. \"This is an update that I think a lot of people are interested in, going from the small enclosed rooms and spaces to a more open floor plan.\"\\n\\nAlthough the renovations were extensive — Guokas estimates 60 percent of the wood in the house is new — the footprint of the house is relatively unchanged. The team added a garage and a bathroom expansion to the 1920s-style home. They actually reduced the number of bedrooms from three to two.\\n\\nThe West Asheville property stands out from the other HGTV Urban Oasis projects. The network has been doing this project since 2010, and the other properties were high-dollar lofts and condos in major metropolitan areas — New York, Chicago, Miami, Boston and Atlanta.\\n\\nJack Thomasson, a house planner based in Atlanta, managed the project for HGTV. He said he selected West Asheville for its neighborhood feeling, even if it is dramatically smaller than past Urban Oasis towns.\\n\\n\"We still consider this a great urban location, like an in-town neighborhood,\" he said. \"One goal in using this house and location is to share all the wonderful things about this house and the area where it\\'s located.\"\\n\\nHe said he\\'s proud of the way the house fits in with its surroundings. Details like the pebble dash stucco and shade garden planted with native species fit the character of the neighborhood.\\n\\n\"We wanted to keep the character of the house,\" he said. \"That\\'s why we didn\\'t take the renovation and do something outrageous.\"\\n\\nMeredith Sims, who recently moved in next door, said she\\'s curious to see what will happen when the sweepstakes is over and the new owner gets the keys to the house.\\n\\n\"It looks like it fits into the neighborhood,\" she said. \"There\\'s definitely a lot of people driving by.\"\\n\\nShe said her only concern is that the TV company subdivided the lot. Guokas\\' company, JAG Green Builders, is advertising a build-to-site opportunity on the unused land. Sims wonders whether the new house will leave room for the large hardwoods that shade the property.\\n\\nInside, the house has a distinctly contemporary feel. A loft for kids or company is nestled under an eave of the vaulted ceiling, and the windows are expansive. Tile and painted wood paneling (wider and more understated than the 1970s variety) cover the walls, and eclectic lighting fixtures hang from the high ceilings.\\n\\nInterior designer Brian Patrick Flynn said the house contains a variety of design elements because he didn\\'t know who he was designing for. \"No matter who wins, there\\'s going to be something that appeals to them,\" he said. \"Every room is super eclectic.\"\\n\\nHis approach is most obvious in the art work that is carefully placed in every room, including the bathrooms. He purchased the pieces in the River Arts District at five different galleries. Featured local artists include Hannah Dansie, Joanna Maldonado, Mark Bettis, Patricia Cotterill, Phillip Deangelo, Walter Arnold and Josh Copus.\\n\\nAll the contents of the prize package — art, house, furnishings, kitchen accessories, bikes and skateboards in the garage and even the clothes in the closets — are included in a prize package valued at more than $500,000. A 2016 Acura TLX and $50,000 cash also go to the grand prize winner.\\n\\nLast year, there were more than 22 million entries in the sweepstakes. Entries are allowed twice a day through Sept. 24, and the network will announce the winner in fall.\\n\\nFor more information or to enter the sweepstakes, visit hgtv.com/urbanoasis.', 'meta': {'pile_set_name': 'OpenWebText2'}}\n",

Written by the late Michael Talbot and initially published in 1982, this highly regarded vampire novel is being released in a new edition by Valancourt Books, and they\\'ve provided us with an exclusive excerpt from the first chapter.\\n\\n\"They are cool to the touch and alluringly beautiful in their ageless youth. Their laughter seduces, their brilliance beguiles. They guard the secrets of science and history, and the answers to the mysteries of life and death lie within their vastly superior knowledge. In centuries past, they were known as the Illuminati. They are the vampire.\\n\\nDr. John Gladstone, a scientist in Victorian London, is thrust into their world after his carriage runs over a young man of angelic beauty named Niccolo. When Niccolo kidnaps Gladstone’s child and vanishes, the doctor must go in pursuit, with the help of his daughter, Ursula, who is enticed by the lure of eternal life, and Lady Hespeth, whose demure exterior hides a dangerous obsession. Why are the vampires taking children, and what is the connection to Gladstone’s experiments with a deadly virus? And how can he possibly prevail against a race of immortal beings with power and intelligence infinitely beyond his own?\\n\\nMichael Talbot’s The Delicate Dependency (1982) is often cited as one of the best vampire novels ever written. This highly anticipated new edition, the first since the book’s original publication, includes a new foreword by Jillian Venters.\"\\n\\nTo learn more, visit:\\n\\nI\\n\\nWhen I was very young I had a vision of an angel, or at least I thought it was an angel then. My father was a physician, as his father was before him, and we lived in the very heart of fashionable London, in Mayfair, on Bond Street. Our house was a dark-brick Victorian terrace house with turrets and oriel windows and it surrounded an enclosed garden shared by the other terrace houses around the square, but closed to the street.\\n\\nTo the best of my recollection the incident took place in the spring of 1856, when I was seven years old. I was able to determine the date many years later because Queen Victoria had just visited the Paris Exhibition, and French bonnets placed very far back on the head had become the rage of the fashionable ladies of London. I had quarreled with my father, although I’m not quite sure over what anymore, and had run into the garden to collect my thoughts. The garden was a mystical place. To begin, the mere fact that it was completely cut off from the bustle of the street gave it an almost religious tranquillity. But it was the cool evening fog wrapping around the chestnuts and lilacs that completed the other-worldly atmosphere. It was here, beneath the huge wrought-iron astrolabe that stood in the middle of the court, that I first saw the angel.\\n\\nI recall quite vividly that I was neither in any sort of reverie that might have evoked such a vision, nor was I given to even the vaguest religious thought at the moment. Instead, my mind was still reeling from the angry words of that argument long forgotten, when suddenly I realized there was a young boy standing before me.\\n\\nHe arrived so suddenly and quietly I scarcely would have noticed his presence had it not been for the slightest rustle of his black silk waistcoat. Naturally my first impulse was to run, but when I looked up and gazed at his face for the first time, I was entranced by his unearthly beauty. He had a thin and delicate face with a fine straight nose, chiseled cheeks, and an angular chin. In fact, the delicacy of his features was so striking he might have been mistaken for a woman were it not for his masculine attire. The unsettling quality, a quality I later came to know as androgynous, was only heightened by his reddish-golden hair, which fell in small fleecy ringlets to his shoulders, gently framing that pale and fragile face. I must add that my first impression of this being was that he was a boy, but there was an ineffable something about his presence that suggested he was older, possibly seventeen or eighteen. Perhaps it was the dreamy and almost sad intensity of his immense dark eyes. Or perhaps it was the regal and deathly still way he held his head as he returned my gaze.\\n\\nAs I stood mesmerized by the stranger I slowly realized that I had seen his face before. However, there was something odd about this sense of recognition. I was certain I had never actually stood in the presence of the young man until this very moment. My recognition was more like the familiarity you feel when you see a famous person on the street whom you’ve only previously known from newspapers or daguerreotypes. And then it came to me—the long, curly hair, the pale, androgynous face. This was the countenance of an angel, none other than the angel in Leonardo da Vinci’s Madonna of the Rocks. I knew it well for I had spent many hours standing in front of that haunting masterpiece in the National Gallery. The Virgin is depicted kneeling in a gloomy enclosure of jagged rocks with her right arm around the infant St. John the Baptist. Her left hand is extended protectively over the head of the seated Christ Child, before Whom John’s hands are folded in prayer, and to the extreme right of the painting is a beautiful kneeling angel. The most disarming aspect of the London Madonna of the Rocks (for Leonardo painted two versions of the work—the second hangs in the Louvre) is that the entire landscape is pervaded by a ghostly and supernatural light. The twilight upon the pallid complexion of the young man created exactly the same effect, and I knew beyond doubt he was the angel in the painting.\\n\\nI have no idea how long we stood facing each other. Before any words passed between us the young man vanished. In the dim and misty light of the garden I could not tell whether he actually faded away or merely crept into the shadows. If he did steal away by natural means he did so with a skill and stealth unmatched by any human being I had ever encountered. One moment he was there and the very next instant he was gone. No crunch of gravel betrayed his exit, no rustle of lilac.\\n\\nI was so thrilled by the appearance of the angel I immediately ran into the house and made my way upstairs. Without realizing what I was doing I burst through the doors of my father’s bedroom. The moment I stepped inside, the impropriety of my deed dawned upon me and I found myself confronted by all the overwhelming things which comprised the presence of my father. My father’s bedroom was large and dark, save for a small circle of light cast by the fireplace on the opposite end of the room. The air was musty and cool, and heavy with the dry, burned-cork smell of my father’s Fribourg and Treyer pipe tobacco. The walls were a dark reptilian green and sparsely scattered with bleak and gray watercolors painted by aunts in the Highlands, and a bed occupied most of the area in the center of the chamber—an immense dark bed, a monster, a tomb, shadowy with dusty and ancient bed-curtains.\\n\\nThe first thing I noticed was that there were several evening visitors in the room, old friends and colleagues of my father. My father was ill and they often met with him in his bedchamber. They either sat or stood around the fireplace in casual but dignified poses. Some boasted gold watch chains and others possessed huge beards, beards like old Russian patriarchs. I always disliked my father’s friends. Like his bedchamber they stank of pipe tobacco. They were always calm and smug and they greeted everything with a sort of priggish amusement.\\n\\nIn the midst of the crowd loomed a chair different from all the rest, a tall chair of elaborately carved black oak, which enclosed its occupant like a huge seashell. The chair was positioned with its back facing me, but through its cabriole-leg hooves I could see the dark green brocade pillar of my father’s evening robe.\\n\\nThe group had been laughing, but after I burst in they all grew silent and gazed in my direction. I padded across the room and stood before my father’s green-robed legs. In the dark alcove of the chair something rustled.\\n\\n“Step closer so I can see you,” he said solemnly.\\n\\nI obeyed.\\n\\nAs I took an intrepid step forward I became aware of another smell mixing with the heavy aura of tobacco.\\n\\n“Closer still.”\\n\\nI moved into the very womb of darkness, just inches away from my father’s cool presence, and the other smell enveloped my face like a warm mist. It was a different smell, not at all like old tobacco, or the distinctive animal scent of my father. It was oddly pleasant and I recognized the familiar aroma of red Bordeaux, an encircling fog of fine claret that often hovered about the darkness where my father sat. I noticed several of the men held large round glasses. Everyone was silent.\\n\\n“Have you come to apologize?”\\n\\n“No, Papa.”\\n\\nNothing . . .\\n\\n“I’ve seen—”\\n\\nI cut off abruptly and gazed into the darkness. No eyes or face. No glimpse of large and powerful hands. Only the warm, wet fog of claret. And silence . . .\\n\\n“I’ve seen an angel,” I managed to blurt out.\\n\\nFor a long time there was no answer, and then, without a hint of emotion his voice asked, “Where?”\\n\\n“In the garden. Beside the astrolabe.”\\n\\nOnce again I stood in the stony presence of an unseen judge. I shifted my weight nervously and felt my palms grow damp. From the darkness one of my father’s friends chuckled derisively and there was movement. Here a foot scuffed across the carpet. There a glass tapped against a table.\\n\\n“And how do you know it was an angel?” my father asked dispassionately. “Did he have wings, and if he had wings, did he have teeth? Were they very large wings?”\\n\\nThere was more laughter.\\n\\n“No!” I exclaimed. I proceeded to relate the entire incident. I breathlessly described the young man with exacting detail and explained how magically he had both appeared and vanished. I told him he resembled the angel in the Madonna of the Rocks and how unearthly the moonlight seemed upon his face. Indeed, I was so excited by the occurrence that I’m sure I glowed with the fiery conviction of the visionary, and when I finished there was an uneasy silence in the room.\\n\\nWith this Father quickly sat forward and for the first time his face entered the circle of firelight. He had a hard face, thin and drawn, with closely cropped white hair and a small, graying mustache above his solemn lip. He was handsome, but age crept in around the corners of his face. His eyes were pale, pale blue, almost gray, like drops of dew on the edge of a razor, and the heaviness of wine crept in his breath.\\n\\n“There are many incredible things in the world,” he said with slow and measured breath. “Dr. Livingstone’s crossed the Kalahari. We can inject medicine beneath the skin with a hypodermic syringe and they’ve crisscrossed the country with railroads.” He glanced around the room at his friends, seeing that they waited quietly for his judgment.\\n\\n“ . . . but there are no angels.”\\n\\nI was stunned. I could scarcely believe that he was so blindly disregarding what I had seen, experienced. “No!” I cried, but my voice was quickly swallowed by the stale air and the crackling of the fire. Again there was an anxious silence in the room.\\n\\n“There are no angels,” my father repeated and finally broke the spell. I looked into his eyes. He gazed back at me. The greater will had won and the other men in the room began to chuckle once again.\\n\\n“Admit it. There are no angels.”\\n\\nI burst into tears and struggled to shake my head.\\n\\n“Admit it!” he repeated again, and slowly, agonizingly, I nodded.\\n\\nI turned and quickly left the room as my father resumed his phlegmatic silence. The glass of claret lifted into the darkness.\\n\\nLater that evening I managed to locate a book of my father’s containing an engraving of the Madonna of the Rocks and I stared at it for hours. There was no mistake: The face of the young man in the garden was exactly the same, down to every last line, as the face in the painting. I fell asleep that night telling myself over and over that I had seen Leonardo’s angel in the garden, but I never mentioned the incident to anyone again.', 'meta': {'pile_set_name': 'OpenWebText2'}}\n",

What would I do if I were in the premier’s chair? Ultimately, if the city says they legitimately cannot function then we do have an obligation at the provincial level within the powers that we have to ensure some clarity and stability,” the Tory leader said.\\n\\nThat echoes what Wynne said last Thursday when she suggested Queen’s Park would be open to giving councillors “new tools” to deal with Ford if city council asked.\\n\\n“Right now it looks like the city is taking its own action. I’m not going to speculate on the nature of the request (from council), a request that hasn’t even happened yet,” said Hudak.\\n\\n“Look, there’s no doubt that we have to get this behind us. This is a sad, tragic situation.”\\n\\nHe also insisted that the controversy engulfing the Progressive Conservative mayor, which has garnered global media coverage, has not harmed the party’s reputation in Ontario.\\n\\nTory MPP Doug Holyday (Etobicoke—Lakeshore), Ford’s former deputy mayor, worried council was going “too far” by “beating up” on the mayor.\\n\\n“As far as coming here to the province to ask us to straighten out that situation, I think they have the power to straighten it out themselves and they should,” said Holyday, warning it’s a “very slippery slope.”\\n\\nLast week, the premier said “if council were to clearly indicate that they lack the ability to function as a result of this matter, the province would respond to a request from council to be provided new tools, depending on what that request might be.”\\n\\n“Because of the extraordinary and unique nature of this type of intervention, I would consult with the other party leaders to see if our legislature could move unanimously if required,” she said Thursday.\\n\\nThe next day, Wynne clarified that by suggesting there need not be all-party agreement on new tools — which are being studied by provincial lawyers — for her to proceed.\\n\\nBut NDP Leader Andrea Horwath is less hawkish than Wynne or Hudak, saying “the appropriate thing is to take a wait-and-see approach.”\\n\\n“Give the city council their opportunity to decide where they want to go. That’s their decision to make,” said Horwath.\\n\\n“The best thing to do is to just stand down. Let them have an unencumbered debate and discussion about the direct that they want to take as a city,” she said.\\n\\n“When something comes here we’ll deal with it in the appropriate way.”\\n\\nMeanwhile, Municipal Affairs Minister Linda Jeffery was dismissive of Ford’s plea for a snap municipal election before next October’s scheduled vote.\\n\\nLoading...

      "{'text': 'Leicester City have lost another key member of the team behind their Premier League title triumph after Steve Walsh was appointed as Everton’s first director of football.\\n\\nThey initially rejected Everton’s approach for their head of recruitment, credited with the purchases of Riyad Mahrez, N’Golo Kanté and Jamie Vardy, before the Goodison Park club returned with an improved offer that met Leicester’s compensation demands.\\n\\nJuventus and Everton set for battle over Newcastle’s £35m Moussa Sissoko Read more\\n\\nWalsh, who also held the title of assistant manager, has started work at Everton with immediate effect, meeting Ronald Koeman to discuss transfers before his arrival was announced. Newcastle United’s Moussa Sissoko is one target but Everton face strong competition from Juventus for the £35m-valued midfielder.\\n\\nWalsh is the second departure from Leicester’s backroom team this year after Ben Wrigglesworth, their former head of technical scouting, joined Arsenal last season. Claudio Ranieri has also lost Kanté to Chelsea despite being able to offer Champions League football next season, unlike at Stamford Bridge.\\n\\nFarhad Moshiri, Everton’s major shareholder, turned to Walsh in his overhaul of the club’s management structure after missing out on Monchi, the sporting director at Sevilla. Walsh was Chelsea’s scout in the north of England for 16 years, while also working as head of PE at schools in his hometown of Chorley. He was promoted to European scout at Chelsea before joining Newcastle, Leicester under Nigel Pearson, Hull City and returning to Leicester in 2011.\\n\\n“I’m proud and privileged to become director of football at such a fantastic and historic club,” Walsh said. “With a new manager and a new major shareholder, it feels very much like a new era here at Everton and that potential is what is most exciting. I know the club well. My roots are in the north-west and my brother, Mickey, was an Everton player in the Bob Latchford era and always proud of that fact. I also did my initial teacher training at Liverpool Hope University many years ago. I’m genuinely excited to be here at the club and very much looking forward to getting down to work.”\\n\\nKoeman has signed only the back-up goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg from Fulham since replacing Roberto Martínez as the manager last month. Anticipated bids for John Stones and Romelu Lukaku, with Manchester City firm favourites to sign the England international defender, have complicated Koeman’s rebuilding plans and the manager is anxious to resolve the futures of both players. He had backed Moshiri’s plans for a director of football before completing his switch from Southampton.\\n\\n“It’s really good for the club to have someone in Steve who has shown his quality at a number of clubs over many years,” Koeman said. “That’s the experience and quality he will bring to us at a good time in the season. He has a great deal of knowledge about building for the long-term and the magnificent work he did at Leicester on top of the job he did at Chelsea makes us excited to have him here at Everton.”\\n\\nEverton chairman Bill Kenwright added: “It’s great news to welcome Steve to our new era at Everton football club. His track record, particularly at Leicester City, is already the stuff of football folklore, and both myself and Farhad, having spent time with Steve, are convinced he is exactly the right fit for our club and our new manager.”\\n\\nLeicester’s director of football, Jon Rudkin, said: “Steve has made a signification contribution to the most successful period in the club’s history and it is with a heavy heart that we accept his decision to seek a different challenge in his career.

They focused on a goal of raising food for people who need it, applied resources and came up with a creative angle.”\\n\\nWhen the Second Harvest barrels were first put out at the dispensary in November, donations were trickling in. After word of the promotion spread to the dispensary’s 1,900 patients, the employees at Granny Purps could barely keep up with the flood of food, and even reduced the minimum amount for the promotion from four cans of food to three.\\n\\n“We only had the barrels out for three or four days before the incentive was announced, and I think our patients would have come out even without the incentive,” Black said. “We have an incredible group of compassionate patients. “… I love that our patients are so compassionate. When we told them that we were doing this, their response was amazing.”\\n\\nSome patients donated way over the minimum amount, like one person who brought in 5 pounds of rice. It wasn’t just the patients who chipped in, either.\\n\\nAccording to Black, one of the growers that supplies the dispensary donated some marijuana to be used for the promotional joints, which typically sell for $10.\\n\\nSecond Harvest, founded in 1972, helps feed an estimated 17,200 people per week; 45 percent of the clients are children.\\n\\nAlmost three-quarters of the clients earn wages below the federal poverty level and a quarter are homeless. The organization’s goal for its 2010 Holiday Food Drive, concluding this week, is 2.1 million pounds of food.\\n\\n“Businesses like these fill half our coffers,” Keith said. “There are some big contributors, a handful of them, but these food drives from small businesses and other groups really do a lot. With everything going on in terms of the economy, it’s definitely tighter out there. It has been a rough year for everyone, and to have new businesses like Granny Purps pitching in is great.”\\n\\nAfter the successful drive this year — the promotion ended Christmas Eve — Black plans to do it again next year and has other community initiatives in the works. “We are planning to organize a beach cleanup in January and have a promotion associated with it, but we haven’t finalized anything yet,” Black said.', 'meta': {'pile_set_name': 'OpenWebText2'}}\n",

      "{'text': 'Several Catholic dioceses in California have announced plans to offer compensation to survivors of sexual abuse through a compensation program similar to the programs operating in Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey. The programs will be administered by the same people who administer the ones in the east coast states.\\n\\nThe Archdiocese of Los Angeles, along with the dioceses of Orange, Sacramento, San Bernardino, Fresno, and San Diego have announced they will offer such compensation to survivors.\\n\\nThe announcement comes as lawmakers plan to roll back the statute of limitations in California on sex abuse cases that happened when the survivors were children. The law change is expected sometime next year.\\n\\nOf course, many abuse advocates view the compensation programs as a way for the Catholic Church in California to forestall future lawsuits which would inevitably be the result of the law change. If passed, AB-218 would open up the statute of limitation for those who were sexually abused as minors. Right now, survivors can file claims up until they turn 26-years-old through the court; this bill would change the age to 40.\\n\\nAB-218 would also expand the definition of sexual abuse and instead refer to it as childhood sexual assault. The bill has passed through the assembly and is expected to pass through the senate.\\n\\nThe debate concerning the efficacy of the compensation plans is heated and is clearly a way for the Catholic Church to avoid expensive litigation. However, the offers made in the compensation program may be rejected and the survivor may choose litigation if he or she receives a compensation offer that is inadequate or unjust. One of the clear drawbacks to the compensation program is that it allows the Catholic Church to keep their secrets. Participation in the compensation fund means that no new revelations will be discovered and the extent of the malfeasance of bishops and cardinals in California will remain hidden. On the other hand, each survivor should be allowed to have a clear choice and make a decision based upon their particular circumstances.\\n\\nIn spite of the pending law change, there are a number of Catholic dioceses in California which have chosen not to participate in the compensation program, notably the Archdiocese of San Francisco. If AB-218 passes and is signed into law by the Governor, the Catholic Church in California will face a tsunami of new lawsuits with fresh allegations of abuse and corruption. The last wave of lawsuits in California occurred during an earlier period where “window” legislation allowed survivors to come forward and the results were devastating to the Archdiocese of Los Angeles and Cardinal Roger Mahony in particular. Mahony’s ill-fated attempt to block public access to church documents eventually led to his demise. New litigation in other dioceses in California would most likely bring similar results.\\n\\nAs an advocate for abuse survivors and a lawyer who has been fighting for the rights of those abused by priests, I am presently speaking with abuse survivors in California.

Un golpe que es consecuencia de la autoaceptación de Tatiana (nombre ficticio para preservar su privacidad), su hija, que cuando tenía ocho años, con la simpleza y claridad que solo da la infancia, supo elegir las palabras. Es el primer caso de cambio de identidad de género y DNI a los 10 años.\\n\\nTatiana se plantó ante la “autoridad paternal” y, según definió su padre, le dio en el medio de la “fe y el machismo”. Luego de esa charla, Damián comenzó a acompañar la transformación de su hija, mientras hacía la propia.\\n\\nDesde entonces, pasó de la no aceptación a ser un ferviente protector de los derechos de su hija trans junto a su mujer, Graciela. Ambos la acompañaron hace tres semanas hasta el Registro Civil para que tramitara su cambio de género en el DNI.\\n\\nDesde que se reglamentó la ley de identidad de género, en el 2012, en la provincia fueron siete los menores de 18 años que pidieron cambiar su género, todos adolescentes. Este es el primer caso de una niña.\\n\\nCuando tuvo la partida de nacimiento rectificada en mano, cuentan los padres, ella “no paraba de abrazar a todos”.\\n\\nTatiana tiene diez años y es la única hija en común de la pareja, que entre los “tuyos y los míos”, armaron una familia ensamblada de papá, mamá y diez hijos. Damián dice haber respondido a un patrón de “blanco y negro”. Llegar a ese gris que su hija le pedía a fuerza de llantos, no fue fácil para nadie de esta familia de la zona sudeste de Salta capital.\\n\\nProceso difícil\\n\\nPara Tatiana tampoco fue fácil. A los 6 años le dijo a su mamá “soy gay“, cuando se enteró lo que eso significaba, aunque no se identificó con la imagen de “dos hombres juntos”, y dejó la idea ahí.\\n\\nLa palabra que le sonó a profecía la encontró dos años después, en la academia de baile en la que tomaba clases. Una tarde, una compañera le contó sobre un documental que había visto en el que había una “nena trans”, “un niño que se hacía niña”, lo que provocó la confesión a gritos “eso soy yo!”, acallada luego por un “era broma...”.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Me puse nerviosa, pensé que me iban a gritar cosas”, recuerda cabizbaja la niña. Desde el principio supo que debía evitar las confesiones, que en muchos casos terminaban en insultos e incluso golpes.\\n\\n“Yo la veía llorar sentada en el cordón porque los vecinitos le pegaban y la insultaban”, lamentó su papá.\\n\\n\\n\\nAdemás de la determinación de su hija, para Damián, los cambios de los que comenzó a ser testigo fueron una brújula. “Antes era un niño triste, tímido, enojado, no se quería cortar el pelo y renegaba para todo, hoy mirá lo que es”, dice mientras su hija menor entra y sale del comedor para ir agregando detalles a la historia que la tiene como protagonista.\\n\\n“Todos juntos”\\n\\n“No sé por qué hay una fila para varones y otra para nenas, deberíamos estar todos juntos”, lanza con naturalidad para volver su mirada a los dibujitos de la tele.\\n\\nEl ser pionera en una causa provoca desencuentros, pero también anima a los invisibles, y la causa se puede volver una trinchera donde las confesiones se liberan de los insultos y golpes.\\n\\n“Solo un niño me entendió, me dijo ‘yo soy cómo vos’, para mí que era gay, él fue uno de los primeros en decirme Tatiana en los cumpleaños”, dice, y recupera con una sonrisa el recuerdo de ese gesto que para ella era esencial: que la nombraran, que la llamaran por el nombre que sentía suyo.\\n\\nNo todos los compañeros de trinchera tuvieron la misma suerte, ante una nueva confesión. Tatiana aconseja: “Decíselo a tu mamá y papá, ellos me entendieron”.\\n\\nCon el apoyo de sus padres, Tatiana se animó a más. Lo que había comenzado como un “juego” en el que ella se ponía polleras, ahora era un tema familiar que había que conversar seriamente ante cada nuevo paso.\\n\\n“La dejaba usar ropa de mujer en casa”, relata su madre, pero para su hija había llegado el momento de llevar a la calle lo que era puertas adentro. Graciela en un principio se opuso “para protegerla, para que no se le burlen, porque no iban a entender”, justifica.\\n\\nPero el día llegó para la procesión del Señor y la Virgen del Milagro. Su madre le hizo una vincha para que disimulara el pelo corto que “la avergonzaba”.\\n\\nLas ya típicas miradas inquisidoras no llegaron, así que fue por más y pidió ir así también a la escuela.\\n\\n“Las maestras estaban asustadas, pensaban que iba a ir... no sé, con plumas”, cuenta riendo Tatiana; aunque el ánimo rápidamente cambia cuando se le pregunta cómo se sintió al entrar al aula. “Nerviosa y más sola. Siempre me sentí sola”, asegura.\\n\\nProblemas en la escuela\\n\\nEn la escuela de zona sur a la que asiste nada fue fácil. Ante la insistencia de que la llamaran Tatiana, accedieron las maestras de música y la de arte. Pero no tiene los mejores recuerdos de la de matemáticas.\\n\\nGraciela cuenta que el año pasado “la padeció”. Fue a la escuela a firmar innumerables notas. “Hasta me reclamaron que iba despeinada, pero estábamos dejando que se le creciera el pelo”, relató.\\n\\nRodeado por los brazos de Tatiana, Damián concluye: “Nuestra satisfacción es verla plena”.\\n\\n', 'meta': {'pile_set_name': 'OpenWebText2'}}\n",

A decade ago, when excessive hard-drive space was a luxury, avid PC gamers would frequently uninstall large, multi-gigabyte games that they were no longer playing in order to make space for new games.\\n\\nObviously, developers would prefer that their users not uninstall the software that they spent years creating. Regardless, developers should ensure that the uninstall process works properly.\\n\\nOtherwise, a poorly coded PC game uninstaller could delete not just the game, but the entire hard drive. That would be a problem.\\n\\nRagnarok\\n\\nIn late 1998, Bungie (which would later create the Halo series) released Myth II: Soulblighter for Windows. Myth II, a real-time tactics game, was received with great reception and highly-positive reviews.\\n\\nBut before the worldwide release, a Bungie employee uninstalled version 1.0 of Myth II, and afterwards, her PC refused to reboot:\\n\\nIt was discovered by a very nice young lady in a Japanese office as she worked on the Asian versions of Myth – just as she was trying out the final build. She attempted to uninstall it from the main root folder of her hard drive – not brilliant, but pretty common practice – and perfectly fine for most games. The game proceeded to eat her hard drive like a fresh Bento Box.\\n\\nThe Myth II Uninstaller worked by deleting the folder which contained the game files. However, this implementation assumed that the user installed Myth II in the default directory. (i.e. C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Myth II). If the user installed Myth II in a different directory, such as the *system root C:\\\\*, then when the user uninstalled the game, all the files in the C drive were deleted. Boom.\\n\\nAs Bungie later explained in a press release:\\n\\nIn certain unusual cases, using the Uninstaller can cause problems. If a user chooses an installation directory other than the default directory, they should NOT use the Uninstaller but should manually drag the Myth II folder into the Recycle bin and delete it. Anyone who has the game but has not yet installed it is asked to wait for a new version of the Installer which we will release shortly. If you have already installed the game, there is no harm in playing it, but players should be careful not to use the Uninstall executable. If you have already Uninstalled and not experienced obvious problems, there is nothing to worry about.\\n\\nCalling the potential obliteration of an operating system a “problem” is an understatement.\\n\\nAlthough the issue was not widespread, Bungie decided to do a recall of all Myth II CDs and redistribute a version 1.1, eliminating most of the game’s profits in the process.\\n\\nYou could say that the Myth II version 1.0 uninstaller worked exactly as intended: it did indeed uninstall the game. It just worked too well.\\n\\nUPDATE October 2014: A year after this article was posted, someone submitted this article to the Reddit subreddit todayilearned, where it subsequently went viral. In the comments, Reddit user rdmartell, a former developer at Bungie, posted more insight into the glitch:\\n\\nSo I wrote the Myth TFL installer (not this one). The reason this happened is because you could install other maps and whatnot, and to make the uninstall clean, we had to recursively delete your data folder. In the sequel, somehow that code (which did sanity checks) was used to delete the applications directory, instead of just the data directory in the applications directory. So if you installed it on C:/, it would delete everything recursively from there. Nowadays, uninstall usually leaves any user installed files (like saves or downloaded content) but at the time, as the article suggests, hard drive space was more precious. Also, I wasn’t there for this issue, so I don’t know the above for sure, but having written the previous installer, I’m pretty confident that’s what happened.\\n\\nLater in the thread:\\n\\nI actually think the bug was only there if you installed directly to root; not even in a folder. As I recall, that was the only way it deleted your entire HDD. Unless it was discovered later by going into the uninstalled code that it could happen in other cases (which I never heard about), I think the issue was a bit overblown by the media. Still, the last thing you want to be responsible for is nuking a customer’s hard drive.\\n\\nSmall world.', 'meta': {'pile_set_name': 'OpenWebText2'}}\n",

Meanwhile, Yaphank’s older facility remains open as does the Riverhead jail.\\n\\n“Phase 1 has already been built and there’s actually more beds [there] than had originally been planned,” said Legis. Kate Browning (WFP-Shirley). “Building these new jails is on the backs of Suffolk County taxpayers. There’s no state or federal funds to help build these things… It’s an old building! It’s got problems. But does the NYCLU have a big checkbook that they can write us a check for $114 million?”\\n\\nThe NYCLU said that its lawsuit makes the case that the county’s “longstanding indifference to the deplorable and well-documented conditions at the jails violates people’s constitutional rights to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.”\\n\\nThe lawsuit is still in the discovery mode, and the county has been stalling, according to Amol Sinha, director of the Suffolk County Chapter of the NYCLU.\\n\\n“At least seventy-five percent of the people in there are simply awaiting trial,” Sinha explained. “We’re talking about basic human dignity here that every single person whether convicted or not should be entitled to.\\n\\n“Raw sewage bubbles from the floor, toilets explode, rodents and roaches infest the kitchens, black mold covers the walls, and drinking and bathing water runs brown and smells of sewage,” Sinha said. “The women in “Orange is the New Black” face miserable conditions and abuse, but nothing in the show compares to what real people are experiencing in the jail where they film.”\\n\\nRiverhead Correctional Facility Complaint', 'meta': {'pile_set_name': 'OpenWebText2'}}\n"
